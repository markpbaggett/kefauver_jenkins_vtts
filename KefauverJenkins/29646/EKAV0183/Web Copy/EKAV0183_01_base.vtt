00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Such procedure is not possible as a terrible.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Similar one they were charged against with their Francis Carr.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
My chiefs of staff, Ian Moon, who's head of the subversive squad for the FBI until the night before he came with my command.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
It has now been established by the testimony of the two principals, Mr. Adams, Mr. Stevens.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
That Mr. Carr is guilty of nothing except for a man in silence when the Carpian Cone were talking.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
I think the committee is a kind of a both-major Carpian, Mr. Cone.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
I don't think it's a crime to be unable to go into word over time.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
That seems to be the only crime Mr. Carr is guilty of.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
A very serious charge against this young man.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
I think we must find out who initiated that, who's responsible for it.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
If they fraud upon the committee, however responsible is guilty of contempt for this committee.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
May I just take a minute to not review the testimony of the department of Mr. Cone is concerned.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
The testimony of Mr. Adams and Mr. Stevens up to this point is that he used strong language,

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
but the only act he was guilty of, two acts and were one he made Mr. Adams take a cab to go to the people.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
He was a whitey-mote in New York, whitey-mote in the car.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
Number two, he was unable to induce me to call off the subpoenas for the loyalty board.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Outside of that, there's the no-touch-wony-viny improv act in Mr. Cone's part.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
I think it's a very serious charge here to try and rob this young man of his reputation.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
The young man who has tremendous record as the committee owner knows,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
record of taking an active part in the conviction of the Rosenbergs,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
the Communist Espionage Agency,

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
of the top communist who are convicted, William Ramington,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
and presenting almost single-handed one.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
The testimony of the grand jury, which resulted in discharge of some 30 odd,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I believe, from the United Nations and Communists.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I think it is of the utmost importance that this order be resundant.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Unless it is resundant, my hands are completely tied.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
There is no way that I can win over the question of murder.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
As the chair knows, and clearly as they list, as the chair well knows,

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
I have taken the position, trying to again, that this castle was called out,

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
and a being by individuals who wanted to discontinue the exposure of Communists in government,

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
and avoid the exposure of those responsible for the cobbling of those commas.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Whoever had that in mind was successful because, as the chair knows,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
we haven't been doing anything for the past few weeks,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
except going to the express new shine, the shoes.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
But I think we have a situation much more important now.

02:56.000 --> 03:06.000
I think the committee will want to know who was responsible for the planning, the guiding of this activity,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
which resulted in a vast waste of time in the part of this committee,

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
and the military summacies I approve of the chair, someone getting in touch with the president.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
And I think that he is a reasonable man, trying to induce him to resund this order so that he can proceed with our hearings,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
and follow the, to the matter of days or weeks I frankly don't care.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Senator, time has expired as any other member of the committee,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
I want to say anything further before we vote.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
We have before us the two propositions, and the vote will occur on the substitute proposition for the chair,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
would like to say only this before the vote is stated,

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
since it seems that he has been singled out by virtue of his office,

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
to make the contract, to try to find out if we can develop a formula of procedure,

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
which will enable us to get the facts we want and the facts we need, despite the executive order.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
He pleads with his colleagues to give him at least a reasonable amount of time,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
so that there can be a reasonable chance for success,

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
because I think we all want the hearings to continue,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
and we want to get out all the facts.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
To do that, I feel that it would be utterly unreasonable to expect to have all of the various ramifications adequately considered,

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
shortly, certainly, of several days, and the 24 hours would be locally inadequate,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
and made the chair say fine.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
Neither of these motions, the one to recess for a day until 10 o'clock Wednesday,

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
or the one to recess until 10 o'clock Monday, even remotely implied,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
a discontinuation of the hearings.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
There was nothing in either of them which says that the hearing is open.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
Both of them are directed to the objective of trying to find some notice up or running,

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
by which we can continue and to get out all of the facts.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
All right, chairman.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Senator Simon.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Mr. Chairman, if I agree with your premise,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
that the hearings could not go along,

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
when other army witnesses fly out towards the decision which presumably could be expedited,

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
it made it all, then I would be very glad to extend the time in order to do what a firm

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
to you wish to do, namely take this matter up with the White House.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
But in as much as I do not agree with your premise that the hearing can go along properly,

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
until the decision is made, and if it is to be made, I agree that it will be made soon.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Therefore, I believe the hearings should go along with other army witnesses.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
And you have a senator going to be here before we vote?

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
If not, the question occurs first on the substitute offered by Senator Jackson,

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
and seconded by Senator McClellan, that we recess until 10 o'clock Wednesday morning.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Those in favor of the respond by answering aye. Senator McClellan.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Aye.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Senator Durston.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
No.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Senator Jackson.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Aye.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Senator Carter.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
No.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Senator Sanchez.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
No.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Senator Durston.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
No.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
The chair votes no.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
The motion now occurs on the motion made by Senator Jackson and seconded by Senator Potter,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
that we recess until 10 o'clock Monday morning next.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
The chair will call the roll.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Senator McClellan.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
No.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Senator Durston.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Aye.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Senator Jackson.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
No.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Senator Potter.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Aye.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Senator Sanchez.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
No.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Senator Durston.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.000


06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
The chair votes aye.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
We stand in recess until 10 o'clock Monday morning.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Thank you, Dave.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
You have just heard Chairman Munn announced that the next session of a hearing will be at 10

06:50.000 --> 06:53.280
a.m. next Monday morning.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.500
The ABC Television Network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army

06:58.500 --> 07:08.500
and the United States.

07:08.500 --> 07:13.500
There you see the members of the committee, their staff, so all of the impetus expectators

07:13.500 --> 07:14.500
here.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.500
Those interested in either one side or the other.

07:17.500 --> 07:21.500
Now, come to their free attempting to move toward the great door here of the Congressroom

07:21.500 --> 07:27.500
and the United States Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington to leave these Congress

07:27.500 --> 07:34.500
room until next Monday morning at 10 a.m. when the next public session of this hearing will

07:34.500 --> 07:35.500
again resume.

07:35.500 --> 07:40.500
According to the motion, just passed by the committee by a four to three votes.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.500
There's Mr. Ray Jenkins, the committee counsel.

07:43.500 --> 07:49.500
I'm very close with our way of being passed perhaps with Charles Maynard, the immediate

07:49.500 --> 07:51.500
foreground, a member of Mr. Jenkins staff.

07:51.500 --> 07:56.500
Senator Boryshock, the staff of the camera, by hair.

07:56.500 --> 08:02.500
Just other reporters surrounding Senator McCarthy, Mr. Cone and Mr. Carth.

08:02.500 --> 08:09.500
Got further details on this particular move, the next move to be made in this controversy

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
between Senator McCarthy and the Army.
