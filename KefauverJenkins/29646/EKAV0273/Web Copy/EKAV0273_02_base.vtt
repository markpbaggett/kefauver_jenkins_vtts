WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The gun is a very clever young man.

00:05.000 --> 00:17.980
I know about his mind, but he was threatening to embarrass the committee by reporting

00:17.980 --> 00:22.000
that Mr. Poong was looking for a special favor for Mr. Shire.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Well, now Senator, so that I, and perhaps the mother, others of us, could be a little

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
clear about it.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Did you get that, if that's become clear to you simply because Mr. Adams discussed the

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
problem at the same meeting he discussed the law, or did he...

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Did he use any work?

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
He talked to him on the first thing he talked about, how embarrassing it would be if

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
we claimed that Colin had asked for special orders for Shire and the late public, talked

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
about how it might wreck the committee and how it would make it difficult for us to work.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
It was just a general discussion along that line and he was the...

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
As I say, he never said, I am going to issue a report for a senior reporter charges against Colin,

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
but there was no doubt in his mind, I'm sure, and there certainly was no doubt in my mind.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
So, unless I would agree to call off the hearings that would happen, now I may say Mr.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Shire was inquired this might enlighten us somewhat on subject.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
I think I mentioned the term blackmail, I think I mentioned the term blackmail at evening to John,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
oh, at least half a dozen times.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
And you were serious when you mentioned the term blackmail, were you not?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Well, I was very serious.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
It's a very serious matter to have someone that tends to blackmail a senator, the United States senator,

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
and it has not.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
It is, but really I assume Mr. Shire, that there is no point in unusual about a department

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
wanting us to investigate some other department.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh, I am there.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I understand, but this is a little different.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
This is a...

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
This is going much too far.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
This is a blackmail that you put in.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
And you have so much time in these hearings, isn't that right?

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
I have referred to this blackmail, I think that is the best term I can use.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Now let me make it clear, when you normally talk about blackmail, you refer to blackmail for money,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
at least that's not made to the legal definition, I'm not sure.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And here in the end of the lecture, there's nothing this has nothing to do with any finances

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
that this merely had to do with the publication of charges that were involved in the committee.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Well now as a matter of fact, it has now developed, at least, that the blackmail was entirely unnecessary

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
because Mr. Adams had a legal defense that was backed up by the highest authority in the executive department,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
they made it into the general.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
The conference, sure, it had been proven that the blackmail was most effective,

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
but it had been proven that these hearings were only called off, only called off when those false charges were made.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
They effectively followed off the hearings and offer some three and a half months, I believe.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
They've been spending the money of the committee, the time of the senators, our efforts,

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
investigating charges, which I'm sure we all agree in our false, instead of doing the job

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
which our committee was set up to do.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
So it was a very effective blackmail.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
But it was entirely unnecessary.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
But it was effective, an effective action, the blackmail was not effective, because I didn't suppose it.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
We'll come to that moment, but it was entirely unnecessary because this man had legal authority backing him up,

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
just saying simply we can't produce him because we think the law is there'll be no use to it.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You're wrong with just unclearly.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Oh, I see.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
The only way I'm wrong with that, I just want to ask you, how long has this like, what's the definition?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I don't think my answers are usually wrong.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
I can't say it's unnecessary.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
The point is that the hearings were not called off.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
I know of no other vehicle whereby they could have called them off except for the charges they should have.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, perhaps I've made my point clear.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
Here's a man that is allegedly blackmailing you out of something that he had legal authority to do without any blackmail.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
No, I don't think any legal authority.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Well, he had the attorney general backing, but better have you have something to do.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
The committee has not done the attorney general, but he is, is he not?

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
The attorney general cannot give him a beautiful sublime.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
All right.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
In front of all the blackmail, I don't think the attorney general tried to.

04:53.000 --> 05:05.000
The further more the blackmail is unnecessary, because the information, sir, that he threatened to disclose had already been disclosed to previous month in a column written by an newspaper man that you don't like.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Isn't that right?

05:07.000 --> 05:18.000
I think that Mr. Adams has testified that he did advise with and give information to provide individuals who have been consistently against investigation.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
That was out of charge.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
How much of a good American column I don't know because I don't read their columns?

05:24.000 --> 05:36.000
You remember, sir, that on December 22nd, you or your column, so have here a bonus data of an article with you based your letter, you based the purpose of your letter on December 22nd, or?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I recall it, sir.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
You've also testified, sir, to discuss this newspaper story from Mr. Adams on the record.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't recall if I sought justice to find.

05:48.000 --> 05:57.000
So that he was giving threatening to give out information, sir, that had already been given out to the newspapers in December, isn't that right?

05:57.000 --> 06:09.000
I don't know how much of it he gave out to these five advisors, five of the individuals I say well, but consistently against any exposure of criminals.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
But sir, those five advisors were given their information after December, not before, not during December.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I have a new idea, he's never told me.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Following that, I only know about that is when I heard him say I'm here the other day.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, you've had that, I mean, we have to say much of the same thing.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
I was very much surprised and very shocked.

06:28.000 --> 06:48.000
The plan that the legal advisor to the Secretary of the Army was opening his files, discussing these false charges, with the fraudulent charges, with the only with the almanes of the press, or consistently against the court.

06:48.000 --> 06:59.000
But sir, if you will agree with me, that occurred after December 1953, so I don't know when he gave out the information.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
You have access to the testimony of at least one of those newspaper men, and it's taken an executive session, have you not?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I have not seen it, Mr. Halsopp, all the time.

07:08.000 --> 07:17.000
It was just himself, Mr. Cohn, and verified a fact, sir, that whatever information was given to Mr. Halsopp, was given after December 1953.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
I only have said that Mr. Halsopp, well, what about the answer?

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, I'm asking the question. If I go out of place, I might answer.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
What's the answer?

07:36.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, if I could say Mr. Halsopp, so testified, I personally don't know whether that testimony is true or not.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Well, he testified to that, I know.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I know, right?

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
I have a father's under arrest, I would put no credit whatsoever, and I'll tell him.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Mr. Halsopp, that's clear.

07:57.000 --> 08:05.000
All right. Mr. Adams also testified to that whatever he did, he did after December 1953.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
So, he had that testimony also.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
I wouldn't recall all of the testimony.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
If you can take my work, you can have a book.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I'll get it for you in a few minutes.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
But I have a free semester.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Well, there are no on-list tickets, I'm going to even turn off the audio signature.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm going to go out there for a while.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I'm going to the Spire.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Mr. Jenkins, now the sun and the column has returned.

08:32.000 --> 08:42.000
We're going to direct the comment to the subject of the chicken lunch, which I've had so much publicity to any question being here.

08:42.000 --> 08:53.000
We regret that his distinguished friend, Abel Colley, from Arkansas, the head of the Democratic membership of our committee was not invited.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm not sure whether it was a shorted to chicken or something else.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
I rather suspect it was because, yeah, something else.

09:00.000 --> 09:09.000
I rather suspect it because before the public and members of the committee wanted to have a meeting with our Republican Secretary of the Army

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
and concerning a difficulty which had arisen between him and the chair.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
So we had the lunch and I'm going to my pocket last night, changing to my other suit.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
I discovered that I still have the original copy of the memorandum in my pocket.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
I have never had this pudding thing there, so I'm going to take it out now and meet it.

09:31.000 --> 09:40.000
And then I'm going to let Senator McLeod on the seat so that he will have everything that the chicken lunch and provided, he's got the chicken.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
And I'll get him a chicken dinner, southern style, sometimes, to come and take the wrap.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Part of it, very far.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
And you may say, will you also acquire the reactions of Secretary Steven to the working?

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Actually, that is the main problem of what I'm about to pursue.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
I shall do that at some length.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
However, let me meet the memorandum first because it is in my own typing.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
It happened that I was one of those that helped arrange the luncheon.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
And I was the one there, apparently, who could type the script right about the text system.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
So I served as the smogger.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And I have the original notes here.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
And I'm going to show the fourth part to Senator McLeod on which was never published by I because of the suggestion of Secretary Steven.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
Fourth point was never made public, so I will show that to him.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm sure he will continue to keep it in confidence, and I have every confidence that he will.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
He said, Memo, I understand.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
The luncheon comes today, attended by Secretary of the Army, Steven, and Senator Smith Harvey,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Eurickson, Munt and Papa.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
The following Memo of Understanding was agreed to.

10:51.000 --> 11:04.000
There is complete accolades between the Department of the Army and the Senate Committee on Investigations that communism and communists must be rooted out of the armed services forever and whenever.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm sure that Senator McLeod and Belger he would have voted I.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Item number one.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Item number two.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
There is complete agreement among us that the Secretary of the Army will argue the Inspector General to complete the investigation which he ordered.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
Upon my return I wrote it because he dictated this like with Secretary Steven's suggestion.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
So the Secretary of my return and with such it will be changed to be his return.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
My return from the Bar East on February 4th.

11:39.000 --> 11:49.000
In the precipice as rapidly as possible, and that he will give the committees and names of everyone involved in the promotion and the under-demand.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
On your vote, this charge of progress and that such individuals will be available to appear before the committee.

11:57.000 --> 12:10.000
Had Senator McLeod and Belger I know he would have been the assistant from the second long enough to vote I for that because that is in keeping with his conviction that the public is entitled to public business and public information.

12:11.000 --> 12:19.000
In view of the fact that Senator Simonton has requested that the calling of the Ritter should be postponed until he returns from New York.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
The appearance of the Ritter will be deferred.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
If the committee then decides to call of the Ritter, Secretary Steven stated that a set time Ritter will be available.

12:29.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm sure my distinguished colleague would have voted in support of his Democratic colleague to carry out the request that we Republicans meeting along with our chickens voted to do.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Incidentally, subsequently General Swicker would never call.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
The fourth point is written out in my handwriting and I give that now to Senator McLeod so he has all the facts.

12:50.000 --> 13:01.000
I have no great feeling that if he wants to disclose that he may have something that is not important but if he has written in and then if he suggests in the Secretary Steven, he was left out of the public police.

13:02.000 --> 13:14.000
I mentioned that simply to point out that in a good-natured vein, Senator McLeod has here several times in the Secretary Steven had continued to advise only with the Democrats as he did for a while.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
He would have gotten along much better than he had if all of them was at the gang of Republicans before we had chicken dinner.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
I think really that was a pretty good memorandum of understanding.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
I know the Secretary Steven thought it was a pretty good memorandum of understanding for a while because we posed together.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
We had pictures taken. Many of the members of the press who are now here were there then. They saw him smile.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
They saw the handshake. After he left, something happened.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
I don't know whether he got back in touch with his Democratic colleagues again or what happened.

13:45.000 --> 13:56.000
I had no criticism of the fact that subsequently Secretary Steven did feel that he hadn't gotten this much from the agreement as he had hoped.

13:56.000 --> 14:05.000
I think perhaps somebody had reported a statement which for the first time I had denied under oath and I was mighty happy to hear it denied under oath for some of the Democrats for yesterday.

14:05.000 --> 14:20.000
When he testified under oath that he did not say and had never said that after the chicken dinner, he made a statement that to the general effects of Secretary Steven said that capitulated and had come crawling on his celly to the committee.

14:20.000 --> 14:35.000
I think he would have been a very unjust and a very unkind and a very unfair and a very uncouth and a very untrue statement because certainly no such thing took place.

14:35.000 --> 14:48.000
As the man who did the typing I can assure you that all five of us participating in the lunch contributed to the memorandum of understanding and the Secretary Steven contributed his very share.

14:48.000 --> 15:09.000
Now in that connection I know and I know with no particular question the fact that our Republican Secretary of the Army didn't come to the Republican members of the committee to seek the counsel of the Republican lawyers and how best to get along with the Republican Congress in case he went to one of the Democrats.

15:09.000 --> 15:21.000
We suggested an eminent lawyer in this community by the name of cart foot which it was his perfect way to do. They are fellow Democrats, they are fellow Nigerians, they are friends.

15:21.000 --> 15:38.000
I have no thought that the way is the intriguing way in which politics is free because politics is a consistent being what it is I can well understand that Mr. Clifford would undoubtedly advise a Republican Secretary of the Army on how to get along with a Republican Congress.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
Some might get to me from what he would publish in law you would have advised a Republican Secretary of the Army on how to get along with a Republican Congress.

15:45.000 --> 16:05.000
Under the circumstances I would like to ask you for a first and foremost request. You may have a second time if you are here and I thank you for your extremely unjustly humane and a fine 30th record in the five so he would advise the Secretary of the Army as a Democrat and fall of the politics instead of as an American.

16:05.000 --> 16:21.000
When he came to him with the story of Jim Wicker, he could fall in the new climate. I think he's done a great injury and I am deeply regretful to have you injected with extremely strong, a threat to the people of the country.

16:21.000 --> 16:30.000
The Joe and Tom Jeff is out here in the closed room. Very well you have your strength to take your point of personal service here if I have something unkind that's hard to put in.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
Clifford who I do not know at all is not intention. I should always say that right now you're also uncuning my money.

16:37.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm not following in the Senate. I was asked if you would say and I think you start waiting for the closing here. I had no intention of impending you move.

16:46.000 --> 16:59.000
I said something which I now repeat which I think is compatible with human nature. And that is I really believe that any democratic lawyer I mean for the subject will be in fine to advise a Republican Secretary of the Army on how to get along with the government.

16:59.000 --> 17:09.000
Some of them in a different way from what a Republican lawyer would advise the same client under the same condition.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I was impending to use it.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
No, you're planning to associate and follow them and follow the jury in Mr. Clifford. No, you're in class and more than the very kind.

17:19.000 --> 17:29.000
I was simply recording the fact that I presume that advice must have come from Mr. Clifford to Mr. Stevens power in the Czechombranches rather than people.

17:29.000 --> 17:47.000
I assume that he's on the spot so that I was only one to two thousand. I was totally incorrect by state of yesterday that the last time in any way of any power that Mr. Clifford held a God in touch with the Secretary of the Army.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
He did not get it. So the Secretary of the Army got in touch with him from Sunday, February 21st.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
There's been several days before the famous kicking lunches. The shocking reaction of the Army is to say so I only read it in the papers of the year.

18:01.000 --> 18:11.000
But I want to just say this again that at the time that Mr. Clifford discussed this matter with the Secretary of the Army,

18:11.000 --> 18:19.000
the Gatjins for Sunday, February 21st. And I must say to all his candidations,

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
one to call that along with many other witnesses, witnesses, the Democratic members of the Committee,

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
wise to call in order to get the truth to the people about this situation,

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
to charm on himself, holding against calling all those witnesses and putting the picture.

18:37.000 --> 18:45.000
I want to remember the term which there are a lot to conclude to me, the little color of it in his time in the trace.

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
I want to say again that he is appealing to no one, improperly, if in fact the two conferences which we now know

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
took place between Mr. Clifford and Secretary Stevens, did take place before the 22nd of February,

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
then the chair is intrigued. He is neither perturbed nor provoked by the facts that he is intrigued by the facts

19:07.000 --> 19:16.000
that having discussed this general situation. Will Secretary Stevens, on a claim by ourselves all the way up to

19:16.000 --> 19:23.000
bowing for his other day of the 22nd, he learned nothing at that time about the facts that there were.

19:23.000 --> 19:30.000
I know I have my day going on. The 22nd is the 22nd, I understand from Mr. Kennedy.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
I had thought I would think that was the 23rd. I think that was the 23rd.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
No one was one Sunday.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
As I say, it was not disturbing. It would intrigue me a little bit, however,

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
if the conference took place before we had this long talk going to Valley Poetry,

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
something we said to me about it because I am a Republican. I am a Fendipotent.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
And I'm fairly intrigued about the fact that at this long-kick election when we relate information

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
to each other about every conceivable phase of this, none of us at that time learned anything about the facts

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
that our Republican Secretary of the Army had been getting some guidance from Mr. Clifford.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
In other words, I think we just perhaps have been helpful to him.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
As we know, something about it at that time. Now, I have a question.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Could I say a word at this point, sir? Yes, I ask you.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
We cannot take it out of my time. So, if I'm just interested in you, you may.

20:23.000 --> 20:30.000
It seems to me very unfortunate that this affair should be coming into this case at this time

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
with the Secretary's evens as I know on either gone or about to go to the chronic low Virginia

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
on very important business for the Army. On my knowledge of this whole affair,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
which is either confined to the newspapers, which I did not read so beautifully there

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
this time, I might today or my conversations with Mr. Steven,

20:52.000 --> 21:01.000
it seems to me that things are being said here very swiftly and perhaps a little loosely as to what went on.

21:01.000 --> 21:10.000
And I think in fairness, Mr. Steven, you ought to commend the ought now to agree that he may submit.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
In writing, a statement on this point, if he sold his irres,

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
it strikes me that he might feel very deeply that he would waste his submits at his statement

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
and in fairness, I ask Mr. Chairman that you allow him to do so in his earned convenience.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
The Chair would certainly speak to himself, be very glad to agree to having submits on this statement

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
because I am sure that he would submit a true recital of the facts as they are.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
With the Chair, I think most of that advice about that, I don't think we need a motion.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
I think we can do that. I'm General Consent. The request is to welcome.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
As I have seen with my knowledge council, as the President of the Robert Kennedy Institute,

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
the first time is my there ever since they're doing so.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
I thought of it because we went too long.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
Down before it's under 22nd, then the Secretary had called me in the evening before

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
and that is now part of the monogamous transcripts.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
It's from the monogamous transcripts, of course, that I have picked up the only information that I have about Mr. Trump.

22:10.000 --> 22:21.000
Not just one of the statements. As the Vice-Chair voted, will the Republican colleagues not to call Mr. Shine for General Law or Mr. Tripp?

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
The Chair stated at that time that if any of them were to request that they be heard,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
the Chair was willing to change his role.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
That was at least a week ago, Mr. Clifford's name has been divorced for at least two weeks.

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
The Chair recognizes the perfect propriety of Mr. Clifford protecting the client, the lawyer relationship,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
which exists between lawyers and lawyers.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
The Chair recognizes the perfect propriety of son and the crafty and suggesting that Mr. Clifford work all.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
He would want to try to change the witness in to confirm or to replace or to question that.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
The Chair recognizes the perfect propriety of Mr. Ruff, saying that if General Law or Mr. Shine would call,

23:02.000 --> 23:10.000
what would the room were expected to testify more in favor of the McCarthy kind of this country versus another fact?

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
That Mr. Ruff, properly, would share the right to call a series of other witnesses to confirm or to replace,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
but General Law and Mr. Shine would say.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
The fact remains there for the two weeks on the screen.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
The terminate these hearings, it was necessary some place to specify the final list of witnesses.

23:28.000 --> 23:35.000
The Chair will now say publicly that he has no worry or no communication of any kind from Mr. Shine or General Law,

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
on Mr. Clark suggesting or requesting that they be caught.

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
None of them have been in any way shaped or formed in contact with the Chair up to this conclusion.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
One day of the hearing, now that the Chair has said he is not at all in derogation.

23:51.000 --> 24:05.000
Are there any of these three individuals who are subject to put the record straight and the point out to my good friend from Arkansas that perhaps the Secretary of the Army hadn't fallen in with such a bad gang after all when he had lunch there.

24:05.000 --> 24:15.000
Because the member of understanding, I think, indicates a course of action which might have provided harmony instead of the kind of disarmament that we have had now for so many unhappy months.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I'm sure that he can't decide on the subject.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
I can't.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Can I make a request to the Chair first?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
The mouth here is from some of your signings and statements.

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
I'm just going to say that there was a call between Mr. Clark, Clepper and Secretary Stevens on February 21st.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
If so, we can assume that is monitored.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
I wonder if we can have that call at the opening of the afternoon session.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I shall move.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Yes.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I am very just one of all the monitored calls we are not produced.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I don't know why someone may have been held back.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Chair, we can only brought out and we discover them by accident.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Mr. Wells, can you produce that at 130?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I am told and so inquired about that.

24:54.000 --> 25:02.000
If there was such a telephone conversation that the family was not from Mr. Stevens office because there is no monitor record of it.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Okay.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Well, I think that is an easy call.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
It has been a personal conference.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
There is no monitor call, of course.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
It cannot be produced.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I have a report.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Chair, I have a report.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
As a lawyer, not a politician.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
I am not very well informed.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
I can only say to you that I know there is no monitor call of this conversation.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I do not need to innovate that there was such.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I know there is a business area.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
But we have now arranged that Mr. Stevens may submit a statement in writing covering this point.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
It has been under discussion if he so desires.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
And if he exercises that right, he will tell you what has happened.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Very well, and the chair, of course, will be happy to incorporate in the record.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
The secretary calls to the chair's mind the fact that our motion not to call Mr. Clifford.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
They have not called Mr. Shine and not to call General Watten was confirmed.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Both them, Mr. Wells, speaking for his side of the controversy.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
And then Mr. Cohen and Senator McRphy speaking for their side.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
The chair now recognizes Senator McRphy.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Yes.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I would like to say something about that call.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
Mr. McCormack, you may have to the name of Mr. Clifford was injected into these hearings.

26:08.000 --> 26:18.000
I asked him what did anything have been his relationship with Mr. Stevens after our last country.

26:18.000 --> 26:25.000
He said that he saw Mr. Stevens once, not as one Friday, February the 19th.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
That's for the best of his recollection.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Mr. Stevens had called him on Sunday.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
February the 21st.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
He was not sure of that, but that was the best of his recollection.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.000
One and two, all of this I have testified to in detail before this committee.

26:45.000 --> 26:55.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, before Senator McRphy and speaks, if I may, I understand that Mr. Cohen has seen some testimony of Mr. Al Sas,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
which I have not yet seen.

26:57.000 --> 27:06.000
And I respectfully request that all executive testimony of any character, whatever, has been taken in these hearings,

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
be published and made a part of the record.

27:11.000 --> 27:18.000
Mr. Mayor, say in advance to the parliament, if you have not seen it, because you have not shown down the office to look for it.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
Then there are types of over a week and your minority councilor, Sir Al Kennedy, has seen it.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
It's the most extraordinary business when the council and the principals in the case,

27:27.000 --> 27:34.000
so allow to see testimony law before the members of the committee, and I don't see why the American people model Al Sas is.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
There is just a general rest in this now as we are.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
If you'll give me a hand right over your shoulder, it has come from Mr. Kennedy.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
He will tell you he has seen it.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Have I not?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
No, I have not.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Mr. Mayor, I have not yet seen it.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Have I not the approval of the chairman of the commission?

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
You have not, because the chairman's found about the rule of the committee, which precludes the commissioners.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Senator McCommott.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Can I ask when are the signings correct?

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
The record I'm sure it didn't mean to make a mistake.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
He said, I have testified three times.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
I wonder if you wouldn't correct that to show that you have never testified, but you've never refused to testify.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
So you have never taken the oath.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Well, I would be glad if you correct that.

28:10.000 --> 28:16.000
I have mentally say that I told you, and the members of Mr. May, in detail, are all that I knew,

28:16.000 --> 28:26.000
who respect this particular subject, and I also again would mind you that there is a very simple way for me to testify on the rule of the former committee.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I never found any of that sentence.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to, if I may, Mr. Chairman.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
You'll find the right answer.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
I think you might tell about Mr. Chairman.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
I just want to make it clear that the senator signings himself, he has told me.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
I want to make it very clear if he didn't tell us anything about the relationship of Clark Cropper.

28:48.000 --> 28:56.000
The Clark Cropper was advising Secretary Stevens until we finally discovered that in the monitored phone calls.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
During all the executive sessions, when they sent a hundred Missouri,

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
was urging that I had made up my mind in this case,

29:06.000 --> 29:14.000
I think that if he wanted to be completely sincere that time he should have told us

29:14.000 --> 29:23.000
that he had not only made up his mind, but that he had gotten the lawyer, had urged Mr. Stevens not to testify,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
and was in effect one of the moving forces here.

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
Now, at this late date, I know what a great waste of time to suggest to the senator from Missouri,

29:33.000 --> 29:43.000
that in the event of fact, he wanted her call, proved so clearly that he was trying to call on with Ruckus.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
I don't have the waste of time, they asked him to step down and not act as a judge.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
I don't want to share what he decides.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
I could write his report the way he'd write it right now,

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
but I don't like these protestations of great piafate,

29:59.000 --> 30:11.000
and he wants the people to get all the facts when the senator from Missouri has lost within his mind facts,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
which would be a value to us.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
For example, I would like very much to know that one of the matters that has been accused in this case,

30:19.000 --> 30:27.000
what part, the principal advisor of the Democrat Party has taken in calling on these hearings,

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
I think the American people would like to know that.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
I think they would like to know it under all senators.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
I think they would like to know it under all senators.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
Why am I not a minister of justice today, and calling on those?

30:40.000 --> 30:47.000
Because, because as you know, Senator, Mr. Clifford having a lawyer-quant relationship with you and Mr. Stevens,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
cannot refuse to testify.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
You were the man with the glad that you become a man of the man of the committee.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
You were the man of the senator.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
You were the man that you give us the information.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I'm not going to press the point you further.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I think you should.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Senator Todd, here's comments.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Mr. Chairman, I will vote.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I want to make the record for Mr. Clifford.

31:06.000 --> 31:13.000
Mr. Clifford notified me, and I told one of the five of the committees that he would be very glad to testify

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
before this committee gets a committee wanted in too.

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
I still notified the committee prior to the committee voting for the three not to have intensified.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Turn them to the right here, comments.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
Mr. Chairman.

31:33.000 --> 31:40.000
There may be those who get a great deal of comfort.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
Out of such hallowed angers have been injected into these proceedings this morning.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
But I doubt it's a fine law of patriotic commerce.
