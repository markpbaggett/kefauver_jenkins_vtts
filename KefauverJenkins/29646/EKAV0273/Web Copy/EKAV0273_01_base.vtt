00:00.000 --> 00:12.400
I'd like to meet our guests who have come to the committee room this morning.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.400
Will you welcome?

00:15.400 --> 00:23.600
We're happy to have you as guests of the committee watching one of the committees of your government

00:23.600 --> 00:24.600
in action.

00:24.600 --> 00:36.800
For now, exactly the first time but perhaps the final time, the chair must convey to the audience

00:36.800 --> 00:40.600
the contents of the standing rule of the committee.

00:40.600 --> 00:46.600
For abiding any audible manifestations of approval or disapproval on the part of the audience

00:46.600 --> 00:50.600
of any time, any time.

00:50.600 --> 01:00.800
The uniformed members of the cultural police, when you see before you, the plain clothes people

01:00.800 --> 01:08.040
scattered among you have a standing order from the committee to remove from the committee

01:08.040 --> 01:09.040
room immediately.

01:10.040 --> 01:16.040
All right, the committee is firmly any of you who for any reasons elective violate the

01:16.040 --> 01:23.200
terms of which you entered the chamber, namely to refrain from audible manifestations of

01:23.200 --> 01:24.200
approval or disapproval.

01:24.200 --> 01:30.280
Those audible manifestations of course would include the plows and walkers laughter and other

01:30.280 --> 01:32.280
audible expressions.

01:32.280 --> 01:40.080
And by large of audiences have been tremendously cooperative and I feel confident that that

01:40.080 --> 01:47.280
type of cooperation will continue now as we entered not only the twilight but the even

01:47.280 --> 01:49.280
time of these years.

01:49.280 --> 01:54.680
On behalf of Senator John McClellan, I would like to announce that he will be in the committee

01:54.680 --> 02:00.920
room a little later, but a special meeting of a committee at which he is remembered dealing

02:00.920 --> 02:04.920
with an atomic energy installation was called for this morning.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.920
And on behalf of Senator Potter, I would like to announce that he too will be in the chamber

02:08.920 --> 02:15.240
later, but he is presiding over some special hearings dealing with problems involving the

02:15.240 --> 02:18.920
television and radio industries.

02:18.920 --> 02:24.280
As we had concluded, I will ask round of questions in the morning or yesterday afternoon.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.520
Mr. Welts had just terminated a 10 minute go-round.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.520
I mean, the drinkers, have you any questions to ask this time?

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
Chair of the press.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.520
No further questions.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.680
The chair has one or two questions that he wishes to propound, but he wants to withhold

02:38.680 --> 02:43.520
them until Senator McClellan is here because they deal with the problem of the chicken lunch.

02:43.520 --> 02:48.280
Senator McClellan has expressed much interest in and I want to try to say she is sure that

02:48.280 --> 02:50.920
that they do a certain extent about that.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.400
Other than making this statement, then the chair will pass.

02:53.400 --> 02:59.800
And chair would like to say that if there are any individuals here in the press or the

02:59.800 --> 03:06.400
radio or the police force or any of the others who have been cooperating and helping with

03:06.400 --> 03:10.800
this committee, who did not receive the invitation, Mr. Montgomery, and I extended yesterday,

03:10.800 --> 03:12.200
I wish you would call my office.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.800
We tried to get every conceivable name with a difficult task we might have missed.

03:16.800 --> 03:21.600
And you who have been involved with this all as sort of co-puck participants in this experience

03:21.600 --> 03:22.600
have been involved.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.600
We would like to have you call the office so we could extend you an invitation if anybody

03:26.600 --> 03:27.600
was unfortunately missed.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.600
Senator McClellan, now having arrived.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.600
The question will pass.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.600
Senator Dirk, can I do any questions?

03:31.600 --> 03:39.600
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to read into the record of the eightth orchestration in the

03:39.600 --> 03:45.600
1994, the US Secretary of the Appeals for the Second Second.

03:45.600 --> 03:55.120
This was a case of the United States versus M. and Deltier, the AMBLSCHK, second

03:55.120 --> 04:02.600
call of the second circuit, 142 Federal Reporter, second clear is pages 503 and 506.

04:02.600 --> 04:08.600
The presiding judge who handed down the opinion was Judge O'Learned Ham.

04:08.600 --> 04:14.600
And he had this to say about an attempt to the government to withhold government records

04:14.600 --> 04:20.600
in a trial which the government draw against certain internal evidence, vectors for conspiracy.

04:20.600 --> 04:26.600
I read only one paragraph into the record, Mr. Chairman, so that he is my fee preser than

04:26.600 --> 04:30.600
have the attention of the committee at some such a good time.

04:30.600 --> 04:37.600
As I said, the case was decided in 1994 and the Al Prickland paragraph reads as follows

04:37.600 --> 04:39.600
from the opinion poll.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.600
While we must accept that there's law for a party to partner the government to suppress

04:44.600 --> 04:50.600
documents, even when they will help determine controversies between their persons, we can

04:50.600 --> 04:55.600
other believe that this should improve their suppression in the criminal prosecution, found

04:55.600 --> 05:00.600
as a follow-up of very deep use to which the documents relate, and whose criminal may

05:00.600 --> 05:03.600
or may tend to extro pay.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.600
So far, the state directly trusts the criminal, the case, the prosecution necessary

05:08.600 --> 05:12.600
in any confidential carry to the documents made possessed.

05:12.600 --> 05:17.600
It must be conducted in the open and will lay there their subject matter.

05:17.600 --> 05:23.600
The government must choose either it must seem the transactions or the obscurity from which

05:23.600 --> 05:27.600
a trial will draw them, or it must expose them for me.

05:27.600 --> 05:32.600
Now, it doesn't seem though as possible to draw any line between documents, who is content

05:32.600 --> 05:38.600
bears directly upon the criminal transactions, and those which may be only given directly

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
about that.

05:39.600 --> 05:45.600
Not only would such a distinction be extremely difficult to apply in practice, but the same reasons

05:45.600 --> 05:52.600
which forbid suppression in one case forbid in the other, although not perhaps quite so

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
imperative.

05:53.600 --> 05:58.600
We hope that the regulations should have been read not to explain the reports here in western

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
india.

05:59.600 --> 06:05.600
Now, I submit that to Mr. Chairman so that it might become a matter of record, and I presume

06:05.600 --> 06:11.600
that somehow my other members of the committee may want to pursue further and examine the entire

06:11.600 --> 06:15.600
opinion by a very distinguished human rights limitation.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.600
Now, I have only one question at the moment, Mr. Chairman.

06:20.600 --> 06:27.600
I think uniformly we've asked Mary every witness on the stand that at least something

06:27.600 --> 06:34.600
about his military experience, his military record, and his military background.

06:34.600 --> 06:39.600
I think, then, for the purpose of Brown, we know the record that is an appropriate question,

06:39.600 --> 06:44.600
and I should like to ask Sonny McCarty whether he would care to stay something on the record

06:44.600 --> 06:47.600
with respect to his own military experience.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.600
I'll be glad to Senator.

06:49.600 --> 06:56.600
My wonderful, or if you'd better ask me, I'd rather bring the written documents up here.

06:57.600 --> 07:02.600
I'd like to have you rely upon any rest of this, and by me.

07:02.600 --> 07:08.600
Let me take the commission with that on his family, then, suppose we defer the matter into

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600
the documents we will be able to go.

07:10.600 --> 07:16.600
I ask that Mr. Chairman at the appropriate time, and I must renew the question.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.600
Can you pass the rest of the time?

07:18.600 --> 07:19.600
Yes.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.600
The interjection has been sent to the White Tech, and the Simonton.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.600
Mr. Cohn?

07:23.600 --> 07:24.600
No.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.600
Mr. Welch.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.600
Yeah, 10 minutes, barely in the morning for once.

07:27.600 --> 07:34.600
I must just say Claire will have the first matter with December.

07:34.600 --> 07:44.600
Senator, I have a mic to discuss with you, the occasion of January 20th, when John Adams visited

07:45.600 --> 07:47.600
in your home in that evening.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.600
You call that?

07:48.600 --> 07:49.600
I do.

07:49.600 --> 07:55.600
Someone fired at that time, and it's true, as is not Saturday, that U.S. Chairman of the Subcommittee

07:55.600 --> 08:00.600
has requested that the Army-Predeucion members of the club or...

08:00.600 --> 08:01.600
Yes.

08:01.600 --> 08:06.600
...and I've laid to pinpoint that with about January the 19th.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.600
You had it one of the times I'd asked before last night.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.600
Yes, but I mean, you really then have a request to be produced in the office.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.600
I have a request to be produced in the Harryville members of the first class.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.600
I gave them a cut-off date last night.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.600
I heard across the three members, one was for them.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.600
And a cut-off date was January 22nd, which is a Friday.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.600
I believe that's the Friday.

08:26.600 --> 08:33.600
Now, following that, I think it's already appeared in evidence, and I'll ask you if you knew

08:33.600 --> 08:39.600
that John Adams had been to see Senator McClellan following January 18th.

08:40.600 --> 08:49.600
No, I didn't know that he had been to see any of the summaries I suspected he had known.

08:49.600 --> 08:54.600
You knew that he hadn't seen Senator Jackson with Mr. Morgan, and all?

08:54.600 --> 08:56.600
He didn't know that, no, I didn't know that.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.600
He knew suspected that he had known.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.600
Yes, I thought the Adams had been to see someone of the summaries, but...

09:02.600 --> 09:10.600
So, on January 22nd, which was Friday, it's true that it's not Senator that he was invited.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.600
I'm sorry.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.600
That's perfectly all right. I'll try it again.

09:24.600 --> 09:30.600
It's true that it's not that you invited Mr. Adams to your home on the 22nd, in that right, Senator.

09:31.600 --> 09:41.600
Mr. Adams was so testifying. I was under the impression that he had called and suggested he can move over, but if he saw as I invited him, I would take his words from him.

09:41.600 --> 09:47.600
I don't think it's very important, but Mr. Adams was not in the habit of inviting himself to your home on the 22nd.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
Well, if Mr. Adams we did, he testified that I had invited him.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.600
My memory is not clear enough on that, so I would correct Mr. Adams.

09:56.600 --> 10:01.600
And I believe the conference took no matter the law that it had been out, it did not.

10:01.600 --> 10:07.600
Well, I think it was perhaps two or three hours. I couldn't think quite a long time.

10:07.600 --> 10:15.600
And during the course, I let this guy understand Mr. Adams' testimony in English, and McCarthy was today's racist, hostess, and Bernie Joel was in his dream.

10:15.600 --> 10:21.600
And I believe in Mr. Adams' left some products of that great state of discolour and give it in.

10:21.600 --> 10:33.600
Yes, in fact, I think we, uh, went to the junior gave the John some, uh, self-decorder sausage and some cheese from Steve Miller who established with the March Bill Wisconsin.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.600
I can't see you.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.600
That's perfectly alright, Mr. Davis.

10:40.600 --> 10:44.600
Open the Wisconsin, you see Steve's cheese is rather important, well known.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.600
Thank you for that, sir.

10:47.600 --> 11:00.600
Now, I think, sir, that you testified that one of the subjects discussed by you and Mr. Adams was naturally the calling of the members of the Law of the Board.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.600
Yes. And would you say, sir, that that was the first subject to discussed?

11:04.600 --> 11:07.600
Not necessarily the first subject of any important.

11:07.600 --> 11:16.600
The first subject was the, uh, the principal subject had to do with the calling of the Law of the Board and calling of those responsible for a comment and profession.

11:16.600 --> 11:31.600
Now, Senator, you knew, and Mr. Adams knew that you wanted to ask those members of the Law of the Board, among other things, questions as to why they declared friction to claim or comments.

11:31.600 --> 11:44.600
Not necessarily friction to claim or comments, but persons who have had long, communist records, some records, some of them with records of stealing radar secrets.

11:44.600 --> 11:50.600
Well, without going into each such case, at least that's what you had in mind, and don't add up his new task.

11:50.600 --> 11:55.600
There's no question about it. You wonder, ask these people about their actions as members of the Law of the Board.

11:55.600 --> 12:07.600
No, that is correct. In addition to that, I admit it's clear, John, that's, uh, we wanted to go to other matters, the transcript will show up to, uh, monitor what we can do with the elections.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.600
That's right. So I think like that.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.600
Yes.

12:10.600 --> 12:23.600
Well, now, Senator, you knew them, as you know now, that for that, any member of the Law of the Board to testify has to use action, with reference to clearing these persons who refer to his commentists.

12:23.600 --> 12:31.600
With, with requires them to give this committee glory security information, and violation of President's order.

12:31.600 --> 12:36.600
Only, uh, you are the one who might get it or not, or whether you are the right or not.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.600
You are the right, but we have to say this.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.600
Mr. McClure.

12:40.600 --> 12:46.600
Mr. Roosevelt also pointed out that a number of these countries have, this is a very important issue in this case.

12:46.600 --> 13:05.600
The question is, can any President, not the old human order, the legitimate of this, can any President, the violation of the Law of the Congress, keep from the American people, but the American people who you were trying to Congress here, because we are there, uh,

13:05.600 --> 13:07.600
hired men down here.

13:07.600 --> 13:14.600
Can any person keep the information of wrongdoing from the American people by an executive order?

13:14.600 --> 13:20.600
I think not. And may I say now that I think this is something we should test out.

13:20.600 --> 13:26.600
Uh, we should test this as a very earliest opportunity by one of the contempt procedures.

13:26.600 --> 13:34.600
Well, perhaps that was so, but on the night of January 22nd, you knew, and Mr. Adam Snow, that the state of the fair is as of that night,

13:34.600 --> 13:42.600
would preclude any members of the executive department, just to find as to loyalty, security, and information.

13:42.600 --> 13:46.600
Whether or not we agree that the human order was right or wrong, that was the situation.

13:46.600 --> 13:53.600
No, Mr. St. Clure, I think that under the human order, they would preclude it from giving us much of the information we needed.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.600
That's right.

13:54.600 --> 14:02.600
But I feel that they could have given us some information number one and number two, I explain to Mr. Adams, I just put position.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.600
But no one except the president is immune to my subpoena.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.600
But once you've been subpoenaed, you're before the committee.

14:09.600 --> 14:14.600
Well, I think you can certainly refuse to violate the law.

14:14.600 --> 14:24.600
Uh, it's possible you may be able to refuse to violate a presidential directive, which is conferred the law, like a question that very much.

14:24.600 --> 14:35.600
Well, you wouldn't want an employee, let's say, as a department of the army, to take it apart himself to violate the order of the president of the United States.

14:35.600 --> 14:40.600
You may not agree with the order, maybe I don't bet, at the moment it's not mysterious.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.600
Mr. St. Clure, with you and I, could argue about this.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.600
Well, I don't think we're trying to finish the subpoena.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
That's right.

14:47.600 --> 15:07.600
The man may say that we did by presidential directive establish the legal theory, knowing the trials of the war criminals that no man could use the order of a superior, as an excuse for example.

15:07.600 --> 15:14.600
I have to say, he had to abide by the laws of the land, regardless of any orders, any superior.

15:15.600 --> 15:32.600
And I think that any individual who knows that communist were wrongfully clear, the son-of-a-half of the secret work, is bound because that's the committee, even though he might lose his job because of it.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.600
Well, let's pass on to their senator.

15:35.600 --> 15:40.600
There's no one in this room or anyone listening that does not understand your position in the matter.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
I have a bunch of...

15:41.600 --> 15:46.600
This is a type of conversation that you and John Adams had in your department, that night, as it not.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.600
But we just give them many things.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.600
Well, I'll ask you the loyalty security board.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.600
As the loyalty security board, the...

15:53.600 --> 15:56.600
For the chosen complainers of the last Mr. Adams...

15:56.600 --> 15:59.600
Well, we know the other subjects, but let's see if we can break the law.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.600
No, but let's let me just give you roughly the general picture of Mr. St. Clure.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.600
Well, I would agree for you, sir, if you don't mind.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.600
Your council will, of course, be allowed to ask questions.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.600
If I don't ask the right question, that's my fault.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.600
Okay.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.600
Thank you.

16:13.600 --> 16:21.600
Now, Senator, Mr. Adams told you that it was his opinion that, as a matter of law, that these persons could not come.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.600
As a matter of fact, as I recall, that's a good idea.

16:25.600 --> 16:31.600
And he presented to what you now believe is a polacious legal defense of this position.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.600
He presented a very good argument, yes.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.600
That's right.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.600
And he's a lawyer.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.600
And you were a lawyer.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.600
Nothing else, that's true.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.600
Now, so that...

16:40.600 --> 16:42.600
Insofar as far as...

16:42.600 --> 16:43.600
Is it penance?

16:43.600 --> 16:44.600
No.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.600
Oh, I got to know you when I'm sorry.

16:47.600 --> 16:52.600
Now, also the questions of Mr. Cullen with this...

16:52.600 --> 16:53.600
Discussed that, nice.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
Right.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.600
Mr. Adams relayed information to you about what he thought.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.600
Mr. Cullen had gotten himself on his next work.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
No, it is not correct.

17:02.600 --> 17:07.600
Well, he told you something about what he thought Mr. Cullen had been doing, getting on it.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.600
No, it is not fitting in fact, Mr. Adams.

17:09.600 --> 17:13.600
Oh, Adams, wait, this is an abandoned Mr. Cullen's part.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.600
Mr. Adams made it clear to me.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
Yes.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.600
Well, that...

17:18.600 --> 17:20.600
Unless the...

17:20.600 --> 17:23.600
...carrying for Cullen all.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.600
Especially the loyalty for his carings.

17:25.600 --> 17:30.600
That there would be charges made against Mr. Cullen.

17:30.600 --> 17:35.600
As I recall, we never even discussed the validity of them, because I don't either...

17:35.600 --> 17:36.600
I don't either want to talk to them about...

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
Well, but you know what?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.600
Discussed that, I don't think they're valid. I don't think so.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
I don't think so.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.600
Well...

17:41.600 --> 17:42.600
It's clear, it's clear.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
Thank you.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.600
If you could give you an answer, Senator McCartney, please turn out...

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
Mr. Jenkins?

17:47.600 --> 17:48.600
I...

17:48.600 --> 17:50.600
Chair will pass until Senator McCartney returns.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.600
Senator McCartney will certainly pass until we return.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.600
So, we can now decide who's there.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.600
Mr. Chairman, if the material is here, I...

17:56.600 --> 17:58.600
If we knew the question, I...

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
...would have heard a little out of go.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.600
So, let me...

18:04.600 --> 18:06.600
...compoint to...

18:06.600 --> 18:09.600
I'm not sure if I can read my answer to Mr. St. Flair.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.600
Let me make a statement to Mr. St. Flair that...

18:13.600 --> 18:18.600
Mr. Adams did discuss Mr. Cullen, Mr. Schien.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.600
He discussed that in our situation.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.600
Let me repeat that I...

18:23.600 --> 18:26.600
I don't think that Mr. Adams himself, that the charges...

18:26.600 --> 18:29.600
...that he was making a young Mr. Cullen.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.600
And he didn't make much.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.600
I don't think he ever felt there was valid.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.600
He knew that I...

18:34.600 --> 18:36.600
... knew they were not valid.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.600
And I believe we had a complete understanding on that.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.600
I don't think there's any question about it.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.600
Regardless of what was set up at time.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.600
Well, a lot of the witnesses there were,

18:46.600 --> 18:48.600
but he's mad at work, it's gut.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.600
But we discussed Cullen time.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.600
I'm sorry, it's some direction.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.600
Are you prepared now?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.600
I have to be fine with the question.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
I have to move a little.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.600
So, yes, your first move to the military.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
That goes to the military.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.600
First, let me say that my...

19:05.600 --> 19:08.600
military, I think there's no further to it.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.600
No worse than the average of the...

19:10.600 --> 19:13.600
...some 10 million men served in the service.

19:13.600 --> 19:17.600
But, however, I do think that...

19:17.600 --> 19:19.600
...I may say, some of my appreciators,

19:19.600 --> 19:22.600
asking this question, you have the...

19:22.600 --> 19:27.600
...new stories, the both men with their record,

19:27.600 --> 19:30.600
and I think it's well to cover that under oath.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.600
Not that I think that record is important at all.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.600
I was a judge in 1942,

19:38.600 --> 19:42.600
as a circuit judge, as a gentleman from the service.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.600
I decided to go to the Marine Corps.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
I went to Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
tried to, and with...

19:50.600 --> 19:54.600
I was told, at that time, that they were taken under advisement,

19:54.600 --> 19:57.600
that I was over 30, that perhaps I couldn't...

19:57.600 --> 19:59.600
...qualified when this does a private...

19:59.600 --> 20:01.600
...regulation case, as you go along.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.600
It was in...

20:03.600 --> 20:07.600
...the Mayor's June, I don't recall the exact date.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.600
I was later advised with the...

20:10.600 --> 20:12.600
...backed on a false case,

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
and I was told that the need of what they called...

20:15.600 --> 20:18.600
...and the need of the title,

20:18.600 --> 20:20.600
meaning aviation specialists,

20:20.600 --> 20:22.600
which again, was a meeting with the men,

20:22.600 --> 20:24.600
the need of some old men,

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
and each squadron,

20:26.600 --> 20:30.600
to sort of act as advisers and counselors to the young pilot.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.600
And they had what year was this?

20:33.600 --> 20:37.600
This was 1942 in June, I think it was June 1942.

20:37.600 --> 20:43.600
They informed me that they made it this one ground-off,

20:43.600 --> 20:46.600
or known as, come that intelligence,

20:46.600 --> 20:48.600
to work with these squadrons,

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
to handle intelligence matters,

20:50.600 --> 20:52.600
handle the problems of the young men,

20:52.600 --> 20:55.600
and they thought, I have a few to apply.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.600
I entered the service.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.600
I think it was July 13, 1942.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.600
I left the service in...

21:05.600 --> 21:10.600
...in a February or March of 1945.

21:10.600 --> 21:17.600
Well, in that time, I served as a ground officer

21:17.600 --> 21:20.600
with a marine valve-arming truss,

21:20.600 --> 21:22.600
did some flying in the back seat,

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600
qualified as a rear seat muner,

21:24.600 --> 21:28.600
did some photographic work in the rear seat of the valve armor.

21:28.600 --> 21:33.600
Finally, it was shifted to the intelligence staff

21:33.600 --> 21:35.600
of what they called comers,

21:35.600 --> 21:38.600
so which means they commander,

21:38.600 --> 21:40.600
aircraft, assault.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
They commander of the aircraft,

21:42.600 --> 21:44.600
assault, and shifts at every three months,

21:44.600 --> 21:46.600
or three months at a non-emang,

21:46.600 --> 21:48.600
three months at a non-emang,

21:48.600 --> 21:53.600
three months at a Marine Corps officer.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.600
And they had chiseled of all the aircraft,

21:56.600 --> 21:58.600
finding any Marine Corps in New Zealanders.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.600
One down the line.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.600
Did you fly in any other theater about the station

22:06.600 --> 22:09.600
besides the Solomon area, or what else now?

22:09.600 --> 22:12.600
I was... I spent my entire...

22:12.600 --> 22:14.600
...sure of duty and feature of the duty.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.600
In the...

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
...general area of the Solomon Mountains.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.600
That was when we started out from the Solomon Mountains.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.600
It was a very hot area.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.600
We ended up when it was...

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
...our other crewmen.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.600
And we got up here on the Solomon's.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.600
We flew the first strikes on...

22:32.600 --> 22:34.600
...the New Island.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.600
There was a great concentration Japanese aircraft.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.600
And air traffic,

22:39.600 --> 22:41.600
and it was on the Crown Revol.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.600
On the New Island.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.600
And the job of the...

22:45.600 --> 22:46.600
...dive bombers,

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
the Gopina bombers,

22:47.600 --> 22:51.600
the other with some concrete land coming in from the west.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.600
New Guinea list, you try and knock out those installations

22:54.600 --> 22:57.600
so they can move into the western Pacific.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.600
Now we'll just take for the record the rank that you had.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.600
I...

23:06.600 --> 23:10.600
For the first rank I had as an officer was the first lieutenant.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.600
They finally got short of captain's land.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.600
They got a captain.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.600
I am now a lieutenant-tenant.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.600
You still maintain a reserve service.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.600
Yes, sir.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.600
And if this is not any mother's question,

23:24.600 --> 23:29.600
would you care to say anything about any awards or decorations?

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
Anything...

23:31.600 --> 23:34.600
...made to you as we talk to your service.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
Fortunately, for the first rank,

23:36.600 --> 23:38.600
we have two, but as you the time passed,

23:38.600 --> 23:39.600
the...

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
...and the question was raised.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600
I think, let them be...

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
...a daily worker in New York,

23:44.600 --> 23:46.600
and let them be a daily worker,

23:46.600 --> 23:48.600
the worker in the war,

23:48.600 --> 23:50.600
that will bring the...

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
...reading of the Fuffi-Wuckert Strike.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.600
The first award...

23:54.600 --> 23:58.600
...that I got the one that I had as a valuable sparing.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.600
I was to have no limits.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.600
As a few of the commander of...

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
...the aircraft,

24:06.600 --> 24:07.600
and...

24:07.600 --> 24:09.600
...the Pacific.

24:09.600 --> 24:13.600
I could read it if you like.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.600
The citation for...

24:16.600 --> 24:20.600
...meritorious official performance of duty as an observer in the recon here.

24:20.600 --> 24:24.600
Of a dive bomber attached to a marine stealth bombing squad

24:24.600 --> 24:27.600
operating in the south-east of the area,

24:27.600 --> 24:31.600
from September 1 to December 31, 1943,

24:31.600 --> 24:34.600
the participant in the large number of combat missions

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
and in addition to regular duties,

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
I could have aerial target perk,

24:38.600 --> 24:41.600
Lieutenant-Eckram photographs,

24:41.600 --> 24:43.600
and then again positions as well,

24:43.600 --> 24:45.600
in the sense that the aircraft's fire,

24:45.600 --> 24:47.600
whereby gaining violent information,

24:47.600 --> 24:49.600
to contribute to the material

24:49.600 --> 24:52.600
is a success of subsequent strikes in the area,

24:52.600 --> 24:55.600
a little suffering from severe leg injury.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.600
It was used to be hospitalized,

24:57.600 --> 24:59.600
to continue to carry out his duties,

24:59.600 --> 25:03.600
as intelligence officer in a highly efficient winner.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
His courage had been to do it,

25:05.600 --> 25:09.600
and the motion of duty was keeping with the highest traditions of naval service.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.600
I already see the number,

25:11.600 --> 25:13.600
I guess you'd call them,

25:13.600 --> 25:15.600
commendation to our question of sleep,

25:15.600 --> 25:17.600
from General Farman,

25:17.600 --> 25:19.600
with an army general.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.600
I would just assume that rhythm of personal

25:22.600 --> 25:25.600
to the members of the unit that cared to heaven,

25:25.600 --> 25:34.600
I received a letter from a method of called

25:34.600 --> 25:37.600
commendation or a prior to something from field crafts,

25:37.600 --> 25:40.600
to a commander of aircraft,

25:40.600 --> 25:42.600
and so the Hamlin was a commander of aircraft,

25:42.600 --> 25:44.600
my son, when I was working in my area,

25:44.600 --> 25:47.600
13 pounds, the ring for dinner,

25:47.600 --> 25:54.600
and so I received the air metal with fire,

25:54.600 --> 25:57.600
a bit of a fire, a fire-opening cluster,

25:57.600 --> 26:01.600
and I received the distinguished flying costs.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.600
And I say, Mr. Chair,

26:04.600 --> 26:07.600
a touching reflection of the land,

26:07.600 --> 26:15.600
that we're setting the receipt of the air metal

26:15.600 --> 26:20.600
when the distinguished flying costs,

26:20.600 --> 26:24.600
it does not have the meaning of use to have,

26:24.600 --> 26:27.600
seeing the ring for the navy,

26:27.600 --> 26:29.600
during the war,

26:29.600 --> 26:31.600
we're just a position, I think, rightly so,

26:31.600 --> 26:34.600
that any man who merely did his duty

26:34.600 --> 26:37.600
flew in combat areas,

26:37.600 --> 26:40.600
flew in combat flights,

26:40.600 --> 26:44.600
that he was not entitled to any decoration,

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
but he was the relatively British military

26:46.600 --> 26:49.600
as taken to, and I think that's the right position.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.600
However, after the war was over,

26:53.600 --> 26:57.600
the Marine Corps and the Navy decided to adopt

26:57.600 --> 27:01.600
the Army's system of giving a war.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
Now, I don't agree with you,

27:02.600 --> 27:04.600
because the Army has some good reasons for it,

27:04.600 --> 27:06.600
they feel it's a morale builder,

27:06.600 --> 27:10.600
their system wants to give an air metal reach

27:10.600 --> 27:13.600
high of flight,

27:13.600 --> 27:17.600
to give a distinguished flying cost,

27:17.600 --> 27:22.600
which 25 come at flight.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.600
At that time, all of us who were entitled

27:25.600 --> 27:28.600
to air metals,

27:28.600 --> 27:30.600
distinguished flying cost,

27:30.600 --> 27:36.600
were requested to submit a record for my law books,

27:36.600 --> 27:38.600
and we received those decorations,

27:38.600 --> 27:40.600
so may I say the same?

27:40.600 --> 27:44.600
Well, I naturally am proud of the air metal,

27:44.600 --> 27:47.600
the distinguished flying cost,

27:47.600 --> 27:50.600
I believe,

27:50.600 --> 27:54.600
that a man flying on the back seat of the diabomer

27:54.600 --> 27:56.600
is not responsible for the flight of the plane,

27:56.600 --> 28:00.600
really taking pictures and shooting the received guns,

28:00.600 --> 28:07.600
is not entitled to compare his distinguished flying cost

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
with the,

28:08.600 --> 28:10.600
the distinguished flying cost, for example,

28:10.600 --> 28:12.600
a man like Joe Pauw,

28:12.600 --> 28:14.600
Joe Pauw has to

28:14.600 --> 28:17.600
shot down some 27 flying,

28:17.600 --> 28:20.600
he's from the great state of South Dakota,

28:20.600 --> 28:22.600
the ninja of the other day,

28:22.600 --> 28:25.600
one of the most outstanding men we have,

28:25.600 --> 28:27.600
so I'm really excited that so that

28:27.600 --> 28:29.600
it will be clear if the situation

28:29.600 --> 28:33.600
I am not bragging about any of the decorations,

28:33.600 --> 28:36.600
the one I'm really excited about is the new expectation.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.600
The visual,

28:38.600 --> 28:40.600
son of Jackson.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.600
There,

28:42.600 --> 28:44.600
I have a minute to answer.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
Thank you, madam.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.600
Mr. Cromwell,

28:48.600 --> 28:52.600
Mr. Welfren, Mr. Dean Ferrer,

28:52.600 --> 28:54.600
I assume the Senate is ready,

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
I'll accept it.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.600
I have a senator around,

29:00.600 --> 29:02.600
he'll go back for a moment.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.600
When Mr. Adam and Senate view were discussing

29:04.600 --> 29:07.600
the problem of calling the members of the law,

29:07.600 --> 29:09.600
would you understand Mr. Adam has

29:09.600 --> 29:12.600
some legal backing for his position over in the Pentagon?

29:12.600 --> 29:21.600
I knew that Mr. Steven was acting up.

29:21.600 --> 29:25.600
I mean, some legal backing, back as a sir.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.600
Well, legal backing, do you mean...

29:27.600 --> 29:30.600
Did he have some agreement with some of the other lawyers

29:30.600 --> 29:31.600
over in the Pentagon?

29:31.600 --> 29:34.600
Oh no, you're thinking of a cell of the products of the showroom.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.600
I've only been zero on the thing, Mr. Steven,

29:37.600 --> 29:39.600
because very poor, we have no discussion

29:39.600 --> 29:42.600
of any other lawyers who discuss the work.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.600
All right.

29:43.600 --> 29:47.600
It's now been an evidence that Mr. Adam had already been

29:47.600 --> 29:50.600
to the Department of Justice and discuss the matter.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.600
Did you know that, then?

29:51.600 --> 29:54.600
I did not know that my thinker John should have told me.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.600
Right.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.600
I said, I did not know that,

29:57.600 --> 29:59.600
and I think his turn was he should have told me.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.600
Well, now, Terry, that he has had some backing

30:02.600 --> 30:04.600
in the executive department for his point of view.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.600
You have to move a high on the night,

30:05.600 --> 30:06.600
and you can get him.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.600
That's right.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.600
And I think Mr. Cohen's explained to us

30:10.600 --> 30:12.600
unless the government has resolved

30:12.600 --> 30:15.600
we're likely to have a collision again sometime.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.600
But now, let's pass on.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.600
Liam already had listed the fact that,

30:19.600 --> 30:22.600
in addition to discussing members of the law of the court,

30:22.600 --> 30:25.600
he and the stratum also discussed with Mr. Cohen

30:25.600 --> 30:27.600
and his son, and you said

30:27.600 --> 30:30.600
you didn't think John Haram believed what he was telling you,

30:30.600 --> 30:33.600
and you and that were a different belief when he was telling us.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.600
Right.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
Right.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.600
So that, since the fire of the jury testimony,

30:37.600 --> 30:42.600
we're both discussing something that either of you believe it.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
Would you like everything to turn?

30:44.600 --> 30:45.600
I wish you were.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.600
I'm sorry.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.600
Are you ready?

30:48.600 --> 30:51.600
So, when you talk about our evidence,

30:51.600 --> 30:52.600
that's not it.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.600
You will walk the discussion something,

30:54.600 --> 30:56.600
you'll believe it.

30:56.600 --> 31:01.600
John, John was letting me know that they would issue charges.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.600
For him, Mr. Cohen,

31:03.600 --> 31:06.600
charges that he climbed on the barracks with the committee,

31:06.600 --> 31:08.600
you wouldn't call all the hearings.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.600
I, uh, I told that he would duel that at last.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
I, uh, thought he might.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.600
Well, now, if you've used some words more than once,

31:17.600 --> 31:20.600
Senator, that are rather fascinating to me,

31:20.600 --> 31:23.600
you have said John Adams made it clear

31:23.600 --> 31:26.600
that he would release this report.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.600
Is that a way of saying, sir,

31:28.600 --> 31:33.600
that he did it by inference rather than by direct language on this part?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.600
Mr. Senkler, uh,

31:36.600 --> 31:39.600
I don't think John ever said in so many words

31:39.600 --> 31:41.600
that he don't call off the hearings.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.600
I will issue a false report.
