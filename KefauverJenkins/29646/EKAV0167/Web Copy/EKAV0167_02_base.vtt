00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I'm sure that you must have discussed that with the Secretary,

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
and the chair very much hope that you will give him an answer,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
which he can base his focus.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Mr. Chairman, I did not mean to be clairvoyant

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
to be able to say to the Secretary,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
you know what the chairman's going to ask this.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
He said, yes, I do.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
And I said, well what is your answer to that?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
I think I've thought him accurately when I say that he's a well primal always,

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
it's up to the committee to decide what is fair and just and equitable.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
But he said, I don't mind self-think it's fair and just an equitable

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
that I should be stuck on with fans for 14 days,

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
and one or two of the fighters on the other side,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
if I've won on my side Mr. Adams has never seen these are at all.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
So I dealt with Mr. Montgomery and asked what he did.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Mr. Carter, that's all that long hard for us.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
It's still a little hard for the chair to get it,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
specifically to participate, specifically for questions,

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
which he would like very much to have because he's proposing to try to cast a specific vote.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
And as I may ask you then Mr. Welch,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
speaking now on the basis of your consultation with the chair,

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
I would be secretary, and speaking his clients,

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
whether you at this time and the real protest against this procedure on the basis

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
that you feel is at the unfair and unjust.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Well Mr. Chairman,

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm not too sure if they are just to Welch and say that to him.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I reported what my client position is, sir.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I'd rather not add anything to that.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
It seems to me that what he said was quite clear,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
if this committee in its wisdom,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
besides the running here in this way,

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
you will see a kind of a feeble grin from Mr. Welch,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
and a smile from the secretary when he's better and back.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
We will accept any strategic mismaid,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
but I do not propose that it is this microphone,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
and use any form of words which could later be interpreted

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
as my having made a deal about this decision.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm not, uh, Chairman,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Mr. Chair, can you say that?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm not asking if you, uh,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Mr. Chair, as well as involved in this,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
he feels he has a right to interrogate the witness,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
to try to find out exactly how his provolence cop feels.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
He is interpreting the question which he has.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
It's a little bit of a problem, sir.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
For the Chair, to be sure as to what Secretary has in mind,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
you will talk to him,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm not sure enough of what had he had in mind,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
so that you can tell me whether you are now telling him,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
either on your own representation or here,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
that you believe that the Chair was involved with this proposal.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
You would consider it to be an unfair or unjust suffocating.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm telling you what I will say,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
and that is I got another diamond-mary property,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
if you want me to put it in the phone again.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I wish you would do that, sir,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
because I'd like to have an answer to my question,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
so I can go to that time as the American people, I would.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Mr. Chair, please follow me here, and we'll give you another sentence.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I've got a little bit of a question.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Can I go to the bathroom?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I'll tell you that, Mr. Chairman.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Mr. Chairman.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm sorry to interrupt any recess.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
For my information, can I ask this question?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I wonder if I was misinformed over the new know-how,

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
I said in my office, and got a size of a number of roles

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
from countries who were honestly trying to cut these short.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I was informed that the changes that were made

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
in the resolution present this morning,

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
with exception of one, were made upon the request of Mr. Welk.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Mr. Welk now comes back and says,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
this is a new resolution as far as he's concerned.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
He asks questions of the Chair, and certainly not answered,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
because this is not his motion.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
He has kindly determined how to vote on a motion,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
and he has made a commitment, perhaps, and unwise one,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
but he has been said that if any of the entities to this dispute

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
are going to face that they considered,

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
but the Chair, and the Chair, is reasonable efforts to bring this

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
to a more expeditious conclusion that they say it's unfair or unjust.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
The Chair will not vote for such a proposal.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Well, Mr. Chairman.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Mr. Chairman, may I have your question?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Mr. Chairman, please.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Mr. Chairman, as Mr. Welk believes,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I do not think we should discuss publicly while he's away from here.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Could I have the...

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
There's a tension, Mr. Welk, for ten,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
because I think that's very important.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I was led to believe certain things that the Chair,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Dr. Dr. Geringon, in the heart,

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
I was led to believe, and I reluctantly agreed to Mr. Welk's suggestion.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I'd like to know now how they're not the workers' suggestions,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
and if they were hired to stay,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
I'd like to have the Chair's attention, Mr. Welk, for ten.

05:10.000 --> 05:21.000
Committee has gone into recess for another ten minutes while Mr. Welk,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
with another diamond in pocket,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
goes out to make another telephone call to the Secretary of the Army,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
who apparently is watching the proceedings in his office,

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
if the Pentagon, perhaps, if he's home via telephys.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
The Chairman, on behalf of the witness chair,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
and takes his place,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
after four, the microphone to address the Chair.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Senator Mont will call the detection back to order in Duff's month.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
Prime Mr. Welk, this is the Associate Council, Mr. Sinclair.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Senator Mont.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Committee, I'm going to order.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Mr. Welk has returned to the committee,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
little man, and Carol, please be here for a moment.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Mr. Chairman?

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
What's the Secretary said in two parts?

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
A, he does not wish to accept from the Chairman a proxy to cast your vote.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
He thinks that the Chairman that is outside his province.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
Secondary, last to turn, he says I continue in my view that the proposed resolution

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
would not be dealt in favor.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
He said anything to would not be dealt in favor, would not.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
The Chair has said, please, I'm prepared to vote.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Is there other discussion?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Mr. Chairman?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Are you ready to vote?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I met Chairman.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Senator McCarran?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
A lot.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Senator McCarran was arrested in the chair.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
The Chair didn't get any of the votes.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Senator McCarran, the Chair is ready for a vote.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
I'll be glad to defer this, but I am completely waiting for after we vote.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
The Chair has said that he is not in this particular point.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Well, that means he will not be here in the Committee.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
This must have been the lightning to the Committee, however, so I would have to turn it on this point slide off.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
The Chair has said, curry for himself.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
He needs the other committee members to identify as the martyrs, Trevor.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Let me ask this, I think the Chair and Council know when I am voted to this Chair.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
So, you prefer I wait until the vote is so aggressive?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I will turn it on.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
What's the challenge?

07:29.000 --> 07:48.000
I have previously announced that I will, and I do now, oppose the resolution or motion submitted by the Senator for Illinois.

07:49.000 --> 08:00.000
It may be in the chairman of the Dyer's House, and that motion is destined to pass, I do not know.

08:00.000 --> 08:14.000
But people are voting on each of us as to take the responsibility for infreasing it, and trying to understand how it operates and what its consequences will be.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
I have undertaken to do that.

08:17.000 --> 08:30.000
And there I say this, Mr. Chairman, I believe I have proper and few deference, well, and to all of the parties to this Parliament.

08:30.000 --> 08:43.000
But I may say that the fair opinion of what is fair and unfair did not have to be in both of both into play by me.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
To place my interpretation on this resolution, it's a text and it's not a question.

08:49.000 --> 08:58.000
I took into account Mr. Chairman what I can see is to be the other party at English to this Parliament.

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
The American people and the welfare of our government.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
So, I have undertaken to investigate and I give you my investigation of it.

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
Number one, it is not a formula.

09:18.000 --> 09:34.000
For expediting the hearing, it is a formula for stopping, for suppressing public hearings which this committee,

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
unanimously voted at the time the hearings, will are.

09:41.000 --> 09:52.000
Number two, it denies to the principles that the Adam, Mr. Coles, Mr. Carr and Mr. Hempfield,

09:52.000 --> 10:03.000
the opportunity to defend under whom in public the serious charges that have been made against them,

10:03.000 --> 10:15.000
and denies them the opportunities for face their excuses in public, or to sustain the grave and serious charges they have made against each other

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
by giving public testimony under whose support and to sustain those charges.

10:23.000 --> 10:34.000
Mr. Chairman this is not just a right, just a right of the parties to this controversy of the principles,

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
but it is their form of obligations and duties to do it.

10:41.000 --> 10:53.000
They duty, that as they undertake the charges, the full power in the bars that the committee has in them,

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
should be exercised in some capital to do it.

10:59.000 --> 11:19.000
There is a right of the position that the committee undertakes to resolve these grave issues on the report of council interviews of witnesses,

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
including principles for this controversy.

11:24.000 --> 11:36.000
Has an alternative to that, or in addition to that, that we both see the end exactly here.

11:37.000 --> 11:49.000
Mr. Chairman, there is not one indication that if this job is to be done and be done fairly incomplete,

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
that exactly here is the short and the proceeding, so is not the slightest indication of it.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
So what is the purpose of it? What is the author of it so intending to know?

12:03.000 --> 12:12.000
When I first met the judge, no bad say, the results, when the consequences will be to carry on this investigation

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
out of the use of the public that is industry, away from the press.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And someone is discerning the color of the agent.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Out of the deal of color of the agent.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
I am not so concerned about color of the agent.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
What is the objection? I didn't invite them here.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
But what is the objection?

12:37.000 --> 12:46.000
We are performing a public duty, a public trust, and I may say, one of the most pleasant and one of the most disagreeable ones.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Either I had the performance in the course of my public service.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Mr. President, I cannot vote for it.

12:54.000 --> 13:15.000
If it is adopted, if this resolution is adopted, in my opinion, it will be of great diversity on American standards of justice and equity, committed by this committee in the name, and for the discredit of the United States Senate.

13:16.000 --> 13:36.000
Mr. President, Mr. Chairman, in the end of expediting the hearing to affair and justice and equitable conclusion, I that will offer as a substitute for following motion.

13:36.000 --> 13:43.000
But after each of the principles of this conversation, the person has testified in chief.

13:43.000 --> 13:50.000
Mr. President, I may comment on Mr. President's ideas to have the opportunity to present Thursday before the top exam.

13:50.000 --> 14:04.000
But each member of the Subcommittee have one hour, six ten minutes period each, for the interrogation of witness, of the witness.

14:04.000 --> 14:17.000
And that is, first of all, the first hour of our planning, how four hours each are interrogating that principle witness.

14:17.000 --> 14:24.000
The Council for the Committee shall continue to question such witnesses under existing rules.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
And when all such time has expired, the witness shall be excused.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
That is the motion, Mr. Chairman, that our office is up to date.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
And may I say this, it will fix the time limit.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
It's quite a long time, I know. I'm not trying to deny anyone.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
All opportunities to get the facts out on the papers, but let the truth be known.

14:54.000 --> 15:06.000
And if anyone would seriously insist that this time limit is too short, or too short, or no, too short.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
I'd consider a many other modifiers to make the time all this.

15:12.000 --> 15:27.000
But may I say this, Mr. Chairman, as to the time when there is three one hour three witnesses at six ten minutes period, I intend to continue in most instances.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
The past says that much time.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
But this, if we are in this witness, is coming.

15:35.000 --> 15:44.000
In bringing this hearing to a final conclusion at some time, this just applies to the principle.

15:44.000 --> 16:00.000
We can bring it to a conclusion with every one of the principles treated fairly and equitably, and we can perform our duties consistently with this.

16:00.000 --> 16:11.000
The standards of procedure and justice that are customarily followed, traditionally followed, in America and New York.

16:11.000 --> 16:29.000
With the senator, he considers the request of the chair that he do not offer his amendment as a substitute, but permits a vote to be held on the just amendment, which it seems to me as a right to be heard on its own marriage, and then offer his as a separate resolution.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I mean, just as I'm assuming the direction amendment fails.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Well, Mr. Chairman, the chair amendment is just in the inventory.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Mr. Chairman, most of the chance to be heard on its own marriage.

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
If I am assured, I do not know what the outcome of the person amendment will be.

16:44.000 --> 16:52.000
The effect should be adopted, and I could not offer this motion.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I only offer it now as a substitute.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
No, the committee can take its choice between the two.

17:00.000 --> 17:09.000
If it rejects mine, then of course there would be no vote on the judgment resolution.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Just a matter of fact, is that adopted the resolution?

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I could get no vote on this substitute.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Now, there's any way to vote on the two.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I read it. The chair recognizes and points to the right of the senator's offer.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
The chairman amendment has a substitute.

17:26.000 --> 17:34.000
But having in mind the effort we went to, the chairman of the attitude of all the entities on a particular proposition before,

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
the chair of the bill gets lightly better to have a vote on each on its own marriage,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
rather than have a diffusion of the issues involved.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Certainly, if the senator insists on offering his as a substitute.

17:45.000 --> 17:53.000
My name is Chairman, I'm not trying to interrupt our investment in a particular technicality.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
I just do not want to be forced to vote on the vote by this committee, on the proposal.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
Yes, the chair will seek and get unanimous consent.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
That the dertian resolution be voted on first,

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
and then here, the expected of the outcome of that vote.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
That's it.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
The resolution then will be the next order of business and be voted on.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
When I have no objections to following the chair,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
the chair will undertake to solicit such unanimity as he can.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
May we have unanimous consent on behalf of the subcommittee that regardless of the vote on the dertian amendment,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
we will then vote on the next vote.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Mr. Chair, I'm sorry to make that up.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Any comments?

18:43.000 --> 18:54.000
I believe that Senator McCrelland can take the dertian amendment loses as the right to have his amendment voted on.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
And therefore, if the dertian amendment wins, I'm at win before.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
I will move that the matter be taken up by the full committee.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
Anybody else want to make sure a wait now a second is a Missoulaan's attention.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
And second is a kind of objection.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
I would assume that we would want to go around and inspire from the various entities involved.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Senator McCrelland.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Are you about to vote as a committee?

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
This would be an Missoulaan substitute for the involved participants.

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
We use any of the participants to respond to the virtual hour of the dertian motion through the committee.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
It is now pending.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Anybody, any member, the committee wishes to do so?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
No objection.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
But it's a number of the principals who just the time is not out of date.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
I'd be glad to hear all that.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
If you're thinking of more time, I'm not trying to put all of anybody's time.

19:54.000 --> 20:04.000
I am trying to limit the time with the idea of expropriating the hearings and in the hope that by so doing,

20:04.000 --> 20:18.000
we may eliminate a lot of the irrelevant things and immateriality and of them and possibly succeed in having the question

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
confined to the issues.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Mr. Chairman.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Senator Jackson.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
I have only one comment to make on the substitute.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
As I understand it, I was regarded as a breach of our understanding with Senator McCrelland.

20:31.000 --> 20:38.000
And at the time he was cut us on in dollars to see whether or unsuscrised to the rules that were adopted.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Chair has only one comment and that is,

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
while it's an effort, Mike's been saying that we save all those time.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I think it might work in the other direction.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And Chair has roughly calculated his time under the McCullough amendment.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
It was provided for about four days of cross-eanimation for each witness.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
He would hope that after one or two or three of the major witnesses have been heard,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
and it certainly displays a witness is more rapidly than that.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
And the Chair would have to say because he believes the directs and amendments as the right should be heard on its own merit.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
If it's voted for as a substitute, the Chair would have to vote in the negative,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
despite the guidelines for the considerations of the merit to the McCullough and the supporters.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Both, by all means, by all means.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
And by all means, by all means, by all means, by all means.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Mr. Chairman.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
And in the cracky.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
Does the senator propose that the time he suggests the elimination of questioning?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
How about these speeches?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I haven't here for the last two, three days.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I'm going to go to the other hill with me to all these closed sentences.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I can't have them go out.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm not saying any questions.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
I didn't interrupt.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I didn't.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Let me finish.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
I think we all over the place.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I didn't interrupt you, Senator.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
All right.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And I'm asking a civil question.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yes.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
We've sent about 90% of our time known speeches.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Now I'm just asking you this question.

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
Your resolution just provides a certain length of time for each individual.

22:00.000 --> 22:09.000
Would there be speeches the fact that some of that time, or will we still have an RR2 speeches every morning every afternoon?

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
Mr. Chairman, I have a letter from the House.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I have a letter from the House of the State of the United States.

22:16.000 --> 22:30.000
That when a point of order was raised, speeches were raised, and that time was not taken out of him who had before or questioning witnesses.

22:30.000 --> 22:40.000
The pregnancy remarks by the committee and it's saying pertaining to the procedures at the start of yearnings or anytime during the course of yearning.

22:41.000 --> 22:55.000
Whether it's either the speeches, would respect the procedure or any other remarks with members of the committee may make with respect to the proceedings at a time when they are not.

22:56.000 --> 23:07.000
Opproplying that time, the question witnesses, that time would not be charged against any other participants who were responsible for this.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
I'm curious to see who's left.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
This is right in the House and all the areas.

23:15.000 --> 23:34.000
You are making a suggestion here that the local federal limitations now, if you would amend that, to provide that anyone who makes a speech about targeting the hearings, would lose up much time from the spirit of questioning, I would say that your motion would have some more americans.

23:34.000 --> 23:41.000
I believe we can never end these if we're going to spend half of each day making speeches.

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
Chairman, no greater than ten of her again, I'll submit my record against his reference to speeches.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I have no intention of making speeches.

23:52.000 --> 24:01.000
It's perhaps on some notion of point of order to merely explain my position, I think, for the well-informed head to that.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
I think I directed my remarks quite a little when I offered this right to speech motions.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
I think I directed my remarks to him stating my reasons why.

24:13.000 --> 24:23.000
I felt it should be adopted and the reasons why they are going to no motion to which such a subject should not be adopted.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
Should I just ask you one question from her and I took my information?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I don't know yet.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm not sure, when he's sent her as an hour, that any speech he makes is subtracted from that hour.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
It's a simple question, I'm not sure.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
The argument is asking you the questions, I'll let your motion.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
No, don't worry, you follow me.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
It's not for X.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
It has an hour to question, I would say, a witness over here.

24:47.000 --> 24:56.000
And if X uses fifty minutes making a speech, does he still have an hour to question or does he only have ten minutes?

24:57.000 --> 25:04.000
Mr. Chairman and I have to do that question, I would say, right at any senator,

25:04.000 --> 25:13.000
doing his case of questioning gets out of order, or in a participant.

25:13.000 --> 25:22.000
Any of the principals or any other member of this committee can leave a point of order.

25:22.000 --> 25:30.000
And that time that it occupies to resolve the point of order will not be taken out of any one time.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
And if he is making a speech, there's no one of Jack.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
He's consuming his time, we're getting nearer, a little nearer than him.

25:40.000 --> 25:49.000
But if he is making a speech in an M-poppy one, the senator from Wisconsin can pop his guess and get a ruling from his guess.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
I may just go down the substitute.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Question is asked, Mr. Welch, why did you hurt?

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
I would like to be, I think I have very little light to be heard, but I would like to be, if you want to know maybe her.

26:03.000 --> 26:18.000
Mr. Chairman, I have seldom tried to lawsuit in which my cross examination of a witness or a party had not be concluded in one day's time.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
We are talking about just that fear.

26:24.000 --> 26:33.000
I do not deny that this is not the biggest lawsuit in which I have ever been engaged because I get the views.

26:33.000 --> 26:42.000
And I stand a middle in awe of promising a competent cross examination of anybody in four hours.

26:42.000 --> 26:56.000
Mr. Chairman McClellan, I would so much rather have four open public hours than to have 40 in post-stations that I think I'd trade the four for the four.

26:56.000 --> 27:03.000
I would lose this much practically, Mr. Stevens must have been examined for something like 40 hours.

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
I'd get 35 less hours on the other principles, but that's all on the drain and I'm not going to keep.

27:11.000 --> 27:22.000
Four hours seems a little short to be heard, and as I say, I would take it rather than a whole lot of hours behind flow itself.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Okay, so go down to the position.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I will wrap you down.

27:27.000 --> 27:34.000
Go to the position and the substitute office, send him a taxi to the sender's action, and the chair will go to the office.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Send him a call.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
Send him a second, send a action and the chair will go to the office and you'll be calling.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
All right, send a action, so.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Send a action.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
All right.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Send a part of the snow.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Senders, stand in hands.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
All right.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Senders, right, act.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
No.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
The chairman goes to snow.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
The motion is lost.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
The motion now occurs on the directions proposals.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
As the vision we made, every chair will call the roll.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Just chairman before you go to the office.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
I just think this position, Mr. Chairman, this is an honest endeavor, I think,

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
to put an end to the vicious effect of this hearing upon the American people.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Every senator must assume his honest responsibility.

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
I've done it in house in Spanish for 20 years or more, and I intend to do it now.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
It's a case of majoring little activities against people.

28:27.000 --> 28:34.000
But when you measure the impact of these hearings upon finding arrest, upon the morale of our people,

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
I think the old week is in behalf of this resolution.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
Every endeavor will make us take thought of all our needs and interests here

28:43.000 --> 28:49.000
and give us every one of their shape that I fully intend to fall.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
I would like to say just this, because he's opposed to both.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
No, I'm the resolution.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
He wants to say that he wants to work with a firm commitment, Mr. Parenthood, from Illinois.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
His visit is very fair and carefully thought out, triple-s.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
I think that the chair has helped us all party to this dispute.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
But certainly, this sufficiently well-spatified so that they would not protest publicly

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
as this program is being unfair and unjust.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
Since one of the entities that he had a right to do has told us to the gifts to proceed

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
you as being unfair, the chair will vote no, but he wants to turn it into what Illinois did realize it is not,

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
because he doesn't feel he has made it very, he's struck you, and it very worthwhile and very honest.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
It's a pretty and like math, that just in the morning will be taken in executive sessions

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
and it can't step to be given out to the public on the all, I believe.

30:11.000 --> 30:18.000
The least will be given out so that the people of the country will have all of the math.

30:18.000 --> 30:27.000
If that dreams deserve one law by the committee to have other principles in public sessions

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
that can be done by a vote of the committee.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
That's the same as through its party on either side.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Now our purpose is to inspire the investigation.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
It's been to ask the thing to do so.

30:46.000 --> 30:53.000
That the chairman, if one of the members of the committee, what are they doing here?

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Bubbler's paying total.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I'm conscious of all of these.
