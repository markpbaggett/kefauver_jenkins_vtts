WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
And it's just that, wouldn't this person just personally,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
or remember the call of the...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm not talking about the call of the...

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm talking about an article in the face, though.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I did not read that. That's the secret of the writing.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
You don't know about it. Yes, I know about it.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
And the call of the... I heard here. I did not read that

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
the secret of the writing. And you didn't know that

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
that member of the press had it. I did not know that he had it.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I thought that the address...

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
It's when we did it.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
It's when it came... It looked like it clicked in this time.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
And ejection? No questions.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
And the time engine? No questions.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
And the driver? No questions.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It's in clarity. The one has been there.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Well, getting back to the question then,

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
at Fort Monmouth, Mr. Cone,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
one of the reasons why you called there was to get the

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
so-called Black Ought Out Order lifted that General Lawton

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
had placed on all the personnel at Fort Monmouth.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
That's correct. That's roughly it, sir.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
And that was the first time you had approached the Secretary

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
or anybody other than General Lawton to get that

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Black Ought Out Order lifted. Isn't it?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Isn't that correct?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
But the first time I directly had, yes sir.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Or anybody in your office probably didn't know.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
No, I think that members of us there had made inquiries out for it, sir.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, James Julianne had called on General Lawton

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
and had been told that he wasn't going to get anything.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Isn't that right? I don't recall, I think.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, that is the subject in substance of this memorandum

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
about October 2nd, is it not?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Let me look at it.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Now, lead it to you. Jim Julianne had been advised by Colonel Allen.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah. He couldn't talk with anyone because of an order by General Lawton

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
from fitting talks to the McCartney-Cadeys.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
It came from Colonel Allen, that's right.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
That's right. It was an order of General Lawton, right?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I don't think the order came directly from General Lawton.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
The memorandum still states, does it not let it come?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
It says because of an order by General Lawton.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Yes, sir.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
And the Secretary listed out the telephone and counter-manded that order.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Yes, sir. The way it happened was...

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I didn't ask you that. I just asked you if he didn't counter-mandate.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Wasn't a question of counter-manding it, sir. General Lawton.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Can he, Vanny, instruct General Lawton to give you whatever you wanted

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
that he served with his security regulations?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Well, I don't know what he said, sir. I know that you were there.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Well, yes. I could only hear one end of the conversation.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
The Secretary said...

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
What I heard was this, Mr. Sanclay. You're right. The Secretary said...

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Lesson forks to witness. That is perfectly all right.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Then there was a long, long trial.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I mean, three minutes in which General Lawton was doing some talking

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
and apparently asking the Secretary, well, can I give him this?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Can I tell him that? And when he was finished, I recall Mr. Sanclay.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
No, I didn't say that. Don't tell him that. Don't give him that.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Think along those lines.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
And Mr. Carr and I look at each other and gather from that.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
That's where the beginning of the conversation

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
sounded pretty good. The end sounded as though we weren't going to get much.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Is that your testimony, Mr. Stone?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Yes, sir. Well, now, the beginning of the memorandum

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
says that General Lawton wasn't going to give you anything, right?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
But General Lawton said it first. General Lawton.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, the memorandum speaks for itself.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
All right. I thought so too. And the last paragraph of the memorandum

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
is as follows. Is it not?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I think you should know that Mr. Stevens was very helpful

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
and certainly indicated that he had no intention of allowing General Lawton

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
to place his blackouts of Army First and L. Ray,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
their responsible contact to the committee.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Yes, that's right. That's a fair statement of what went on, isn't it?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes, sir. There's no indication there that the Secretary was being

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
at all on the cooperative visit. No, the Secretary had said

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
with reference to talking to witnesses, which is the obstacle we had run into

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
at that particular moment. And I want to make that very clear.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
He said that it was perfectly all right for us to do that.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
We told the mother departments that allowed us to,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
and he called General Lawton and said, General,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
as far as I'm concerned, it's perfectly all right

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
if they want to cause the people on your post, people will work to.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Now, how do you want to leave it, Mr. Stone?

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
That the Secretary called on the telephone and then offered cooperation

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
and took it back, or do you want to leave it?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
As this memorandum at least does to me,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
that the Secretary was very cooperative.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
If you produced the monolith flow, which we bestow, we would know.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Just answer the question. If you produced the monolith flow, which we

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
is, well, we would know the answer, without any speculation on my part.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
All right, so I'm only asking you what your testimony is.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
My testimony to you is that Mr. Steven Sista, the General Lawton,

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
that the General had authority to let us talk to his people.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I have the very strong impression from sitting in that room that there were

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
other things which General Lawton asked if he could do for us

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
that Mr. Steven Sista, and he could not do for us.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
If you would produce that monolith flow, we would know the answer,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
so it's very quickly.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
So Mr. Carr says in the memorandum that Mr. Steven Sista was very helpful,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
you don't necessarily agree with that.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I'd like to look at the monolith flow first.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Just answer, do you agree with the statement made by Mr. Carr?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Mr. Steven Sista's very helpful.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I am so far as letting us talk to witnesses the answer is yes.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
I am so far as what he was keeping from us.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
I can't know that, so you show us the monolith at call,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
and I can hear what General Lawton was ordered not to give us.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, this is a very complicated subject.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I'll pick that up in a minute.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Now, but it's a some important to you and I both realize this is

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
to just plan the fort mom's investigation started, isn't it?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, I know when it started.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
You know when it started, right?

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Well, you do also know that the Army suspended several employees

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
in the last week to September, don't you?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I don't know the dates. I certainly take your words out of the thing.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Well, without, I don't know the exact date either,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
but there were five six dispensions in the last week to September.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yes, I think you're right.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
That's right.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
And so it would be nice if you could say that you started your investigation

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
to fort mom's investigation, right?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
The fact is that we fit there.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I understand, and you bait that on the fact that you interrogated

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
and hearing and employ you the signal call along out on New York.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
No, sir, we do not.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
All right.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
There are other facts which I'll be glad to tell you about.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
We had thought for months that employees long prior to the first dispensions.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Is that right?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Yes, sir, that's right.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, then why was it necessary to call upon Secretary Stevens

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
to get the blackout order, Mr. Litticone?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Because the second time we went back to one of these employees

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
who had thought for it's really the first time,

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
he said something had happened, and there was a blackout order

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
and he was no longer permitted to thought freely to us.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Are you suggesting that General Lotton was first

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
open with you and then closed the door on you?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm suggesting, sir, and it's only my opinion here,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
that they were first open with us.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Then something happened, and General Lotton was told

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
that his people could not thought to us.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
And at the second time, we tried to throw up through witnesses

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
who had been free before they were no longer free,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
and then I went down to the airport to see if it's why that happened.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Well, then, event, you want to say to two first stars

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
to fort mom's investigation on August 30th,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
when you interrogated the guard as long as it started long before that.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I understand that you say that you decide

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
your preliminary investigation in February or March.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
That right?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I would say that spring's here, yes.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Well, all right, spring.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
But that's something that's not known to the world, is it?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
It's a sense of where it means, you're looking for some time

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
with the chairman.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Because this close examination is to determine whether or not

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
the committee or someone else would get set up for the suspension

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
of the bunch of communists, I would be glad to complete

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
that someone else could get set up for it.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I don't care who gets set up.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I think we should get down to the issues in this case.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
I know the chair, Chair, or the board,

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
is questioning to do this, but if there's any situation

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
I can make, so we'll come down to start thinking of the plan to make it.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Now, this all seems to be a question of which should get cut it for

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
getting rid of the 35 individuals of communist records

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
in the board of mind.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
If I don't make this a plain clear half-aid,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
if I can get rid of the plan of pressing,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I'll be glad to stipulate that anyone who he will name

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
can get the credits for the suspension of those individuals

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
of communist records.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
Well, Mr. Cohen, you recognize as I do that in this very room,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
the charge has been made that the Army was still elected

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
in their duty in getting rid of these security risks.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Do you recognize that?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I don't see that.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
As a matter of fact, it's been several statements made to the effect

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
that the Army had ignored FBI warning over a period of years.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Isn't that right?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yes, sir.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Well, I'm very un-initiated in this surface of the tone,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
but I have understood the FBI does not issue documents

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
entitled quote warning, unquote.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
As a matter of fact, they make no evaluations due to these.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
I've never seen anything labeled warning when we use that word,

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
sir, that the FBI sends over a communication to the Army saying,

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
you have working in secret radar laboratories at Fort Martin,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
the New Jersey people on whom we are the following information,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
one that they were associates of Adam's five,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
two, just Rosenberg, two, that they've been swiping papers.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
So on the self-worth, I would consider that a warning, sir.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
You would.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Yes, sir, I would.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Well, I would agree with you, but at least it's not entitled

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
FBI warning.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Is there simply a recital of that?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yes, sir.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
To be evaluated by the recipient.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yes, sir.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
Now, you learned that you're not doing the course of these hearings,

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
that Secretary Stevens had requested the FBI to make a full scale

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
investigation of Fort Monmouth in April of 1953.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I admit to Steven, say that.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And you believe it, don't you?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
But say, yes, the FBI did it then?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Yes, yes.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Well, now that has been meant, I would be a matter of what?

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Two months after he came into office.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Yes, sir.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Now, let me put it to you.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Do you consider the Secretary Stevens ignored any FBI warnings

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
and view of that fact?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Mr. Stevens, personally, sir?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Yes.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
As long as I can tell you,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
whether Mr. Stevens knew about the situation personally,

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
I certainly cannot in time should say that he ignored warnings.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I would first have to know if they were called to his attention.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, now, if he asked the FBI to make a full scale

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
investigation, that's about the best thing you could do, isn't it?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
No, sir, not at that point.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
It is.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
No, sir.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
It's something you would certainly recommend, but, so, doesn't it?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Uh, it seems nothing.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
That's the answer, sir.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
No, the answer is, you wouldn't recommend it.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Thank you, sir.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
That's just not the situation in this case.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, if you were the Secretary Army,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
and you thought you had a situation at Fort Monmouth,

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
wouldn't it occur to you that a nice thing to do would be to ask the FBI to investigate it?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
The first thing I tried to do was find out if the FBI had already

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
investigated it and given me sufficient information on which to act.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Which they have done that, writing them another letter and say investigate it again,

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
probably would mean another way of six months before any action would take it.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, some of the information was a little fail, wasn't it, Mr. Cone?

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
Well, it's very hard to say that information about connections with timing and advise is failed.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Well, in any event, if Mr. Stevens asked the FBI to make a full scale investigation

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
within a matter of two months from the time he took off,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
if you don't think that that was a bad thing to do, do you?

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
I think, sir, that's probably an unnecessary thing to do with the FBI,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
had made such an investigation already and was unrequited about it.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Well, the Army had it, it was packed on the basis of the result.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Well, you!

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
The poor, the next round of questioning begins and while we go.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm going to hit the mouse.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm going to hit the mouse.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm going to hit the mouse.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Just one question.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
The job of looking for one of the best-for-getting terminus and subversion

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
just on a state in the North-Arys,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
that would include sort of normal,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
but normally be the job of C2, the great.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
Not that I've heard, so this was a feature responsibility, not an FDR responsibility.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
We discussed in June, December,

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
enough the post report that indicated that C2 was probably badly infiltrated by coming.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Yes, sir.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I'm aware of that.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
We had general records before, the head of C2,

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
and the admittedly new practice was nothing about the cumulative schools and the bedside.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
I think that's a very fair characterization of the post-month question.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
So, if you may have a very unusual talk here over here,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
about the spectacularly arranged,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
not people are having a zone in front of them,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
FDR, namely D2,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
but asking if they had a due,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
but should be done by an Army in California.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yes, sir.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Don't you think that might make a bit of explanation

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
if the height of an up-conference

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
is on the television screen,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
you have to call upon the FDR,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
there is definitely a situation there,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and you're very correct.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
This was primarily a keen, silly responsibility,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
it should have been handled within the Army,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
and I would say that since the matter has been brought out there,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
why would an element of trying to pass the box in this case?

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm sure that there was sufficient information on the basis of what the Army could have taken action

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
about any further investigation from the FDR.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
In other words, this type of signal

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
got a file, we know there was

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
professional information in the files,

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
so immediately they take action against certain individuals

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
in the thick of radar laboratories,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
and from the surface,

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
it would be easier to be a rather a thorny action

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
to try to pass the box onto FDI.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I'm a very much, very much in my depth,

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
very much to see if anything felt new that was being done,

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
but there's no reason that I'd accept to, again,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
hang on with the roof doors,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
and if the roof door and any of that

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
would be over the past 26-29 days,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I think what the roofer showed

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
was that we were getting awfully

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
green with a number of people who have been

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
putting all of their radar-honny foot towels

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
from the system.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Well, let's just call them now.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
I don't like to engage in verbal arguments with the kind of hypothesis

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
that co-pales with the Hector Hoover are pretty good co-pales to hang on to the right there,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
and this is what I can think of none better.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
So you don't really condemn the secondary for calling in the FDI,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
what monitor can they produce?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I don't know, he called them in.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Well, he testified, he did,

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
and he said he's the right candidate there,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
and I'll give you the face and it's very good on him tomorrow morning.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I didn't know whether he meant it with a personal action

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
or whether he found a letter written by somebody in his organization

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
over to the FDI.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
And you don't condemn the E2 in the Army for clustering with the FDI, do you?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
But, you know very well, I don't condemn anybody.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
That's all I've heard.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
You did.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
I can agree on a few things, and that was one of them.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
As a result of every following that action.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I have to stand again to the state.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
The law is, point of order, to move a little bit away from the state.

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
Two of the four pills and three things that are talked about co-operations in G2 and Lee.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
Left behind, the thing to me that's in the FDI,

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
then the overwhelming intelligence repeated reports,

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
indicating my fourth astronaut's arm and the astronaut's Russians

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
and the new action has taken until its committee saw hearings.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
So that's really Mr. Frank Ferris' idea of co-operations.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
It's not my idea of co-operations.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I continue to do that.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Thank you Mr. Gerrard.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
You learned also that following the request of the FDI vacate,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
first gave investigation to the court,

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
on the list that the first suspension just went around the middle of August of 1953.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Do you learn that?

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I know that on the many aggressive chiefs of minutes,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
here they listed one suspension I think, August of 19th.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I don't know any of the details of that suspension.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Well, at least as to that one that's gone,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
that was before you interrogated the guy along Island.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
That was before we interrogated the guard,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
it was after we had to mention the investigation to the court, Mark.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I understand.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Now, the fourth thing in its proper perspective,

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
you know and I know that the president's eyes and hour

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
changed the rules of the game in April, do you know?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Yes sir, there was a new executive order.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
That's right, and where has before April of 1953,

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
out to the security risk of a person who resolved his favor to persons,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
after that date they resolved his favor to the government.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
That's correct?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Oh, sir.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Wait a minute.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh, this is your business.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I'm just an interoperator, isn't that true?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
It's not quite that simple purpose.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Well, I know it's over-simplified, but it's a sense for that, isn't it?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
That's the part of it.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
So it will be almost a logical thing to do to review the files of the court,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
and the report on them to see if the change to the rules

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
would require some further suspension.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
That's part of that date might not have fit at the bill, isn't that right?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
It doesn't even complain about them having been reviewed.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
It's not as fact-natured, sir.

18:03.000 --> 18:10.000
You don't have any complaint about secretaries Stephen Hanley and Tom Minas in the Army, do you?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
It's a very broad question, it is.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
So what do I see if you can ask?

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
As far as Hanley individual communists or anything along the lines concerned,

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm sure that the Stephen would think it's to get them out.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
The good news is that you were.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I'm sure that's it.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
When you get down to the question of the first case and think along those lines,

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
I feel that Mr. Stephen has probably been imposed on by people who are advising him

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
that it's smart to keep from this committee the names of the people who are responsible

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
for the cover-up of the first case.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
And I would, on my level, respectfully, get to agree with what has been done there.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Are you, sir?

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
I'm sure that Mr. Stephen says no use to come.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Thank you for that.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
Secretary Stephen told you and the senator in the country that he was finally served names, did you know?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I'm so waiting for him, sir.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
I didn't ask you if you're still waiting.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
You said he was finally served?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, he can stay here for many months, sir.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
All right.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
And you believe in wanting to have him serve?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Don't you?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I was very much like...

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
You know, Mr. Jenkins has them.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
But they're in the field on for what he can't show them.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
You know, Mr. Jenkins' rule is that that case is another case,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
and we're not going to try to throw out a case here, don't you?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I tell you, it's the same case.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, don't you know that?

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Well, if you tell me those names will be made public and we can go into it,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
as soon as the investigation here is over, I would be very much pleased.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
Well, I wish I had enough authority, because it's a minute I'll have to run to my left.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I'll be right back.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
As we know the answer to the judge, but all I want to say is this,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
the names have been delivered to the council.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It's just about an hour there.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
The council of the Army has an objection to frame Mr. Jenkins' friend,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
the...

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
The government has requested a letter,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
whether or not he's hearing his case,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
and he's concluded to be able to be released to the public,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
to the lady who commits,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
and the other person who's been sent to the council to say that they believe

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
they answer that question yet.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It seems to me very...

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I like this letter.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I'm not asking them to make public.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I don't know if it's in the Army,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
but do I defend the Army and not have the council to say

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
the Attorney for the Secretary of the Army?

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
She has no objection to those that Army are being turned over

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
to be regular and rough-to-getting committees.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Here is what I can and do say about it.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
The envelope containing the names has been turned over to

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
the council for their commitments.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
There is no intention or right-of-notions of what's going

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
those things.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
They're in the hands of the committee.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
If and when the committee takes up the investigation of the press case,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
it will be for the committee to decide then what they do about the envelope

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
with the names in their possession.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
No, sir.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
The statement is there.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Call up a little bit.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Take another good time.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Well, that's the take another good time.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
As a time-keep, we're due to give in the start.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
We want to discuss that one more question.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
You recognize what you've told us as I did that.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
If we were to try the first case here, we'd be here for several days.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
My very well-being.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Thank you.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Now?

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
Through the months of October, you held hearings for months.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
If you know.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Through the months of October.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Yes, sir.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And through November.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Yes, sir.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And five December.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Yes.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
Now, I think you're you've testified here that in substance,

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
you had no doubt that the secretary Steven and Mr. Adam

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
did everything they could in substance to get you to stop that investigate.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Is that right?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
They wanted us to stop this.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Well, they wanted you to stop it.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
They expressed that desire to you.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Did they know that you're testimony?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
It is, sir.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
And did they do anything about getting you to stop it?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
They have to stop it.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Well, I think you went further than that.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
As you had told, you said they started to break candles

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
and do everything else.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
You get you to stop, is that right?

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
I think that the action taken with respect to General Lawton

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
certainly was not designed to encourage us in our investigation.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
And the lawman, this is the act that Mr. Adam and Mr. Steven

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
did to try to get you to stop.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Is that right?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yes, sir.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Are you sure about it?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
What time's time for my mind?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I'm thinking of a few things, sir.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Now, just a few things?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Yes.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Well, then that effort was very...

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Praise, what are they, Mr. Stone?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Sorry, ask me to characterize Mr. Frank,

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
where I can tell you well.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
Now you say just a few things that they did, is that right?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Yes, sir.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Well, any act that they did to get you to stop the hearings

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
and for monoliths would be an act of uncooperation with you, wouldn't it?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I think that's a foretry of support.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
But if they tried to get you to stop the investigation,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
they certainly were not cooperating with you, wouldn't it?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I don't think that was followed, sir.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
If they tried to get us to stop, we wouldn't have had anyway.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
It didn't mean that they were telling us

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
information from us if we went ahead.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Well, if they tried to get you to stop and took action,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
to get you to stop, you mean to say that that's consistent?

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Was cooperating with you?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
No, I'm saying this, Mr. Frank,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
where that...

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
If they tried to get us to stop, if we told them we couldn't stop,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
we were going ahead.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
The action's trying to get us to stop,

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
but not pre-close them from cooperating with us as we did go ahead.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Well, do you mean to say that in one moment they'll try to stop you

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
and then they lose, and so then they go ahead and be nice to you for a while,

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
and they try to stop you again and they lose, and then be nice to you for a while, is that it?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
So even when they were trying to get us to stop,

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
at the beginning, certainly, they were not unnights about it.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Well, what?

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Let's go and let's see if we can do this rather simply.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
Can you tell me whether or not Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams cooperated with you at court moments?

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Oh, if they may have sent you out, if they may have sent you out.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
So if they may have sent you out, is that right?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
That's right.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Well, now Mr. Stone...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I know it's an exercise, but no, there's no question.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Some explain, they said it's a lot better.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
No, there's no question Mr. Stone.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And I said, no, there's no question, please.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Well, I wanted to say this, Mr. Stankley.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I know what you want to say.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
I might complete my answer, I think that's not only here, but on other occasions in the past,

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
I have said for the record, and for all the records that we went through with the investigation,

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
we had received cooperation from Mr. Stevens and on occasions, even from Mr. Adams.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
It's not about that.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
Well, now what is it? Did they cooperate or didn't they, Mr. Stone?

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
They certainly cooperated with us with some extent, so there's no doubt about it.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
To some extent?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Yes, sir.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
They didn't give you the 100% cooperation, is that it?

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
No, I would say if you'd compare it to the government printing office.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
No, no, it was not 100%.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Ah, now to some extent they did cooperate.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
That's the way you want to put it.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Yes, sir.

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
I think, and I said, when you were speaking through the record, on December the 8th, 1953,

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
you put no limitations on the fact that they cooperated with you.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
You're even married with what I'm talking about.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I know, sir.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I think so.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
I have a lot of media.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
I think that Mr. Stevens read into the record here.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
The statement I sent in the McCarthy and possibly won by me in which we did at a public session

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
and it's the beginning or at the end that we were sure Mr. Adams and Mr. Stevens were cooperating

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
and wanted to cooperate with us.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Well, you met what you said then, didn't you, Mr. Stone?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Sure.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
You had no reservations when you said it did you?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
This was important.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
This gets public, doesn't it?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Yes, I got public, sir.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Well, this is important, isn't it?

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
The document I have here, I better look at that.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
If December the 8th, it's the public record, the Army table card is the version that's been on here.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I think that was today, Darren Coleman.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Do you have a service in the Army?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
The decals?

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
The families of this Army have a service.

26:49.000 --> 26:56.000
You are the part of that time, not in questioning that's called, but in making your statement.

26:56.000 --> 27:03.000
The whole day to go to the second Army, delivered to me, they sealed on the low,

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
containing certain information that has been requested of you and contains.

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
The first place Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, the information contained in that envelope,

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
would ship no light on other issues with this controversy,

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
would not be germane to the anxiety to now be conducted.

27:28.000 --> 27:40.000
In the second place, Mr. Chairman, it is a confidential communication, containing information about which Mr. St. Clair has just questioned the witness,

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
or about with some reference was made.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
In the next place, Mr. Chairman, I am not cared for confidential information.

27:51.000 --> 28:02.000
From at least more than one occasion here to four, I have made an attempt to completely confirm the specificity of my self from this document.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
I see no point in whatever in it remaining in my custody of any further.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
I have no intention of whatever of making this deal on the low.

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
I hear and now publicly do that, to send this envelope back to the Army

28:19.000 --> 28:30.000
to the person who had missed the well, and I ask the permission of the chairman of the committee to be allowed to do so, I see no reason why I should be only waiting for further.

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
By being required to continue to keep in my possession a document that is properly never at any time given to nobody,

28:39.000 --> 28:49.000
whatever in particular in this in place, and Mr. Chairman, I respectfully and kindly request the committee to now permit me to do so.

28:49.000 --> 29:01.000
I am sure that he cannot oblige his distinguished friends and kind of see that document was intended for the committee in response to every request by one of the committee members of one of the principals of that in this discovery home.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
We are very happy to know that you still have it, the unbroken steel, we have kept the things that we have shown you the committee in response to.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
Thank you, we have the cake.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
Other than that you have no comments, I have no questions.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I have a chair, no pass, that is going to come.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
Can you stand my leg? Can you stand my leg? Can you stand my leg?

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
Just one of your questions.

29:26.000 --> 29:44.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn, I have been here for about the attempt to follow up the hearing and the press for the coming of an authoritarian defense plan of an out of line.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
There is no question in any of these lines, I guess, but Mr. Cohn, Mr. Adam was successful.

29:52.000 --> 30:00.000
That is why I shouldn't finish Mr. Cohn, Mr. Adam, appears now that Mr. Cohn made a morning swap or eight foot from the head.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
We thought it was right here.

30:03.000 --> 30:13.000
We didn't have that party for any of the things, but there is no question about the fact that somebody has succeeded in following up the exposure of Communists in the military.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
We didn't have that in the military and we didn't have that plan.

30:18.000 --> 30:37.000
So that regardless of what the efforts were, as of the day to day, as of this day of June, the efforts are full for a number of weeks.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
Yes, sir, it's not out of line.

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
In here, Mr. Cohn, we've safely found Mr. Cohn and he had just to see you loving the record.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
I don't think the time of the committee to read it doesn't what she says in a fact.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
There's really nothing to this.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
All this talk about the Cohn's trying to fair.

31:05.000 --> 31:26.000
In view of that, there isn't much doubt about this there, but I thought that has been a small practice upon the members of the committee from getting out to sit here and investigate a charge made there so after the man making the charge said there's really nothing to it.

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
Now, Mr. Cohn, you've asked me about cooperation to the court.

31:34.000 --> 31:46.000
It's important the answer to the Adam Stevens charge that we did get, but it would be rather good cooperation.

31:47.000 --> 32:10.000
The individual communist, but got absolutely no cooperation, complete opposition, when we started to explore the tragic forms, those were responsible for the clearance of those individual comments.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
That's right.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
Here could be a little call vote.

32:14.000 --> 32:25.000
Care was suggested since the Dalmat's fire, but how can he have ended the recess to go there and stay recessed until 10 o'clock and we'll travel to the human's room to find the right to give a man the share of this one up.
