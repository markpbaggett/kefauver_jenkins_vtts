WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I think that's the only one we've got there.

00:03.000 --> 00:15.000
Now, there has been, I think, a small number of instances in which we have received officially

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
FBI information, I'm not as a unbearable important.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
So, I ask you sir, if I could ask, some weeks ago in this room,

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
I have some that they said over the radio, I want to notify government employees

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
that they may bring chama documents to me, and that I will never reveal their name.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Do you remember that sir?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I don't remember saying that, no sir, I can sign it for you.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Don't document? I don't believe he said that, but I believe he said,

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
my government employees bringing information concerning the life that he's made at the action,

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
and the executive branch.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
In the moment, I will look up the reference and I may have slightly overstated,

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
but my question to you is this, since those words went out over the radio,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
has there been an increase in your intake of information from informants?

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Sir, you would have to send them across the way he's received.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I frankly, must admit that I have not been able to keep up to date with the subcommittee work

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
and the investigation of Communists because all my time has been taken up in connection with the hearing.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
So I can't say I just want information and how much of it has come in during the past couple of weeks.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
I think it would be of some interest to know whether or not the flow of information from informants has increased

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
or diminished or stayed constant.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Is there any way to tell us that God discussed that?

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
The question that's in the country when you have them on the stand, I was getting around with no.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
I judge the censor as the dizzy too, but the answer is this, if you come.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
If I understand it, and let's see if we can't get this down quite simply,

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
as I understand it, it's just as simple.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
If the FBI turns a top secret document to some government department

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
and some employee over there sees it gathering dust,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
does that imply these things for too long?

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
You believe they have a perfect right to bring it to the senator or to you?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
No, the answer is it's not that simple.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, I don't know why you make it difficult for me.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Certainly under certain circumstances.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
You believe that person may bring it to the senator.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Mr. Waltz, I'm sorry.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I can't do answer that yesterday.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I can answer this way.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm not concerned about the actual bringing of the document,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
but I'm concerned about it learning our situations in which

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
FBI information about Communists and other information about Communists

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
is being ignored by a government agency which is letting those Communists stay on the job.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Whether that's done in a form of saying, here's a memorandum,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
here says, or whether it's in a form of someone coming over and telling us

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
that there are Communists over here, the FBI and other people have been

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
well, and they head off about it and no one's doing anything about it.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I don't care much.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, a form that's been in the judgment of the government employee of the receiving hands.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
The situation in his mind is just as you now describe it.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
So it's time then according to you,

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
trying to make a copy of it and bring it over to the senator or to you.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Not necessarily.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, why do you always qualify it?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
It's all right to do it, isn't it?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
So what I've been trying to say is this.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I think it is perfectly all right.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I think it's just too...

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
All right, you've answered it.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
It's perfectly all right.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
That's good enough for me.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Now let me look at the other end of it.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Will you miss your comb?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Is it?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Mr. Chairman, now to just...

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Mr. Chairman, may I ask you a question?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't know what he was going to say.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Well, he was going to say it was perfectly all right

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
because that's what he didn't say.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Mr. Chairman, can I ask you what this is?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Including...

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
No, I...

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I am not saying anything.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I think that's it.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
I would say, sure, that it is perfectly all right

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
for the government employee to tell us

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
like I think it's the duty under the law

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
to tell this committee about the existence of a situation

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
in the executive where they're covering up and lack it,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
and acting again, coming in it in the executive branch.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I think that much is very clear in everybody's mind.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
But the night and most complete way to tell you

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
is to bring over the FBI documents

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
during the date on which they received it,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
and the information they got, isn't that right?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
No, no, sorry.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, a beautiful way to do it isn't it?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Well, sir, in the government...

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Well, then you can see the date Mr. Cohen

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
on the document can't do.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Sir, in the government's printing...

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
How can you answer that?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
It's a bring over the document.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
You can see the date on which they received it.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Sure.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And you can see the information that is involved.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Sure.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
And you can tell how long the time has been.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Sure.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
And you yourself can form some judgment

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
as to whether the government agency is moving through slowly or not.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Thank you. That would be one question.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
So a very nice way to do it,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
and I don't see why you have to fence with me.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
It's for the employee and the receiving end

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
when that employee thinks it's gathered enough dust.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
It's all right with you.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
To get it out and dust it over off and bring it to you.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
That's right, isn't it?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Uh, no.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Why do we have so much trouble?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It's on the one...

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
On the one we were told.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
We have told them this to well,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
because you're going...

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
As I know you won't answer.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
You're going into a question that's a long one

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
and a complicated one.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
And I'm trying to give you the best answers,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
which I cannot.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
I can't...

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I don't want to sit here and make...

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
a long answer to these questions on the other hand,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
and giving a one-foot worth,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
I can't apparently congrade you to the situation as it is.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Let's try it this way.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
This one's surely weakening me on.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
As to the two-and-a-quarter page document.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
What's my camera?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I think it's my...

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
No, it's not that I'm just...

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm just trying to give you one to the page document.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
It's not Mr. Cole.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
We can certainly answer directly, maybe not.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Mr. Cole, the two-and-a-quarter page document,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
which the senator had in the room,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
asked of that one,

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
you surely found it was time for the third young man

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
to bring it all.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Mr. Chairman.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Mr. Chairman.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Do you find it funny?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yes, very important.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I am practically all the community

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
of both the Democrats and Republicans.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
As is this, the rest of the year,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
and the press in hoping we could get this investigation into.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Now, the issue is here very clear.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
So, there are not Mr. Cohn and my self-Mr. Charag,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
there's none due to pressure on the Army.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
So, although the Army tried to blackmail us

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
out of a hearing of communism.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Now, the assessment of documents,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
sharing dust, but documents,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
should be brought over.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Here's an interesting subject.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And Mr. Walsh may be able to cover on this,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
but it's a vast waste of time,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
and we've all given our time to Mr. Walsh,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
both the explanation.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
You may continue, Mr. Walsh.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Now, this is home.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Well, I forgot the last question, Mr. Walsh.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Well, my question was,

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
when that two-and-a-quarter case document came over,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Mark took the top confidential,

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
which is the highest FBI marking, is it not?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I think it was the only FBI.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Well, that's top secret, isn't it?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
No, sir, it's not.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Well, in any of the other secrets.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
No, sir, it's not.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, you know me, it was just public doubt.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
It was confidential.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
It was confidential.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Now, when that came over,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
it was all right with you.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
You have the furniture taken, wasn't it?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Well, I wasn't consulted on it, I certainly think.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
But it's all right with you.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So, I see anything on it, sir.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
That's right.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
No, I don't think so.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
That's right.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
I don't see why I picked it so long as they have.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Not only asked you about the other areas.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Suppose an employee in the FBI,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
that's the odd,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
watching on the other areas of the deal,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
has seen no action,

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
and felt that that employee wanted to tell you about it.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Would that two of them all like with you?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
No, let me see if I understand that for a while.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Have it read for you, because it's easy on this sir.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Follow me to the question, time off.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Now, let me ask you about the other thing.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Suppose an employee in the FBI watching on these,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
other end of the deal,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
had seen no action,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
and felt that that employee wanted to tell you about it.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Would that two of them all like with you?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Now, let me see if I can find that I am back in.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
This is a lot of healing.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
No action within the FBI,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
or no action on the part of the other areas.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
No action on the part of the receiving agencies,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
or else, I think in a large number of it,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
the certainly FBI would not know

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
what follow-up action has been taken by the receiving agencies

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
or the situation would not be within the knowledge of the FBI.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Well, just suppose that you call them that at the FBI end,

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
there was a disturbed young man who felt no action had been taken.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Would it be all right?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
It's either a copy.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I don't think you thought it would go that way, sir,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
because I think at the FBI end, they was not known.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Just what follow-up action?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
But it's always agents served young men felt

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
that no action was being taken and thought it could be.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
So, what do you accept this?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's a lot of determinants by your men.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Does that mean that you have to?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
No.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm telling you, it's a lot of time.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I don't think that anybody in the FBI says no.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Just what follow-up action was taken by the people in the other agency.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
I don't think you could have a situation such as you suggest.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
But where we find out, like in the government printing office in here,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
it's from the receiving agency.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Sejentgen?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Carol Fasten in the front.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Carol, I'm going to pass.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
What will be a function that after the document

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
will move to the sign work going on during the family movement?

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
All from the military, the official, the focus is sharing this community.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
I made a table, so that there may be two opportunities

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
for the process of revelation regarding the whole.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Senator Farmer, right now, I shouldn't have done that.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I think I would like to say he was advised by the witness as of yesterday morning

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
that the documents are ready.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
And everybody wants to ask questions about them

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
and they're called to know.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Sure.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
There are them.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Well, I want to tell you that there would be a data for our well-known officer,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Matt, but I'm sure for a long time,

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
he's sharing his means by the no opportunities to see that as a sign of that

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
is to move it.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
In the case of medicine.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
We got him ready.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
We got him ready for the subject of the call on committee to test the emergency.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
A lot should work for the committee to call if the case starts to get him,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
so that we'll have an opportunity to see them.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Sure.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Well, all right.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Here, it happens a little bit this time, if I think you'd like to have that.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Maybe it happens a little bit so we can have that opportunity.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I don't know if it's this day.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Any questions?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I want that, but I want to see what's so much of those.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So, they have to talk about the work.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Well, Mr. Hengen, it's just time and so there will be in the end

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
of the Council and each committee members on a two-way plan.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
We have to go to the committee to examine it.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
We want those ten of them to take us out.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I don't know why you want them to.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Just go and have to get the big gifty boss.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Notting this room.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I'm sure at this time, right here, it's possible moment.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
So we can't get down to the end, like you want to reach out to the end.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
No.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
We have to wait until the place, then, to go.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Well, what other things.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Well, we have to be aware of it.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
We have to wait until the committee can just mark the start and everything to be cancelled.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Well, we are.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Well, there was a long number of the committee and then Mr. Hengen.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
I don't know if we're going to have the capacity to be counted.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
We have the option to not allow a might office to allow you to.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Unless you take out the title, it's very slightly worth it.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't think all the job will move over to the right.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
It's time for all the people to raise their mind and they come to the upper region

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
as many women as they want and his office.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Thank you.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Mr. Hengen.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Good morning, everybody.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
I have a way to make one observation for all the purposes of it.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Holding the right to the right with respect to the FBI.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
And then I shall have one question of.

12:27.000 --> 12:36.000
The mischermany within the course of a radio panel about two months ago with four or five very

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
extra-mindedly-fought and perling questions of me for 30 minutes or whatever it was.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
I think in a great and very high mention something about a FBI file.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
I think that's an innovative mind that one can easily drop into when you're talking about files and one family or another.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
And suddenly, I mention FBI files.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
Now, the strict fact to the matter is that in nearly 20 years of legislative experience,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
I have seen it at home as one of the FBI files.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
And that's what Mr. Chairman I was entitled to see because it was a file on a nominee

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
that had officially come to my attention.

13:17.000 --> 13:29.000
So that if there is any unit bulletins or any erroneous impression that FBI files are sliding around in this government for all the fees,

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
the file is returned to from Illinois since then I want to call it right now.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Now that's the foundation that the colonizer is for one question, he's defying you now.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
From your experience in the department of justice over here to come,

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
just how available are these files to a two-house government?

13:50.000 --> 13:58.000
Are there great quantities that are stuck here there and everywhere and accessible to literally hundreds of thousands of people?

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
Or are they in the main modesty number and security world guarded in the face instance

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
so that when we think about FBI files and their availability to people,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
it's not quite as the dimensions that one might think.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
No, sir, it's not quite as the dimensions one might think.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
I don't think I actually ever saw an FBI file as such.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
The only thing you might see is in the government,

14:24.000 --> 14:38.000
would be FBI reports, which would be circulated officially to a certain class of people who are business concerning the monthly action on the basis of those reports,

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
such as you want to carry two out acting on an automation,

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
or in the case of government agencies acting on the basis of those reports to get the people named in them,

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
and giving a royalty hearing or put out or whatever else might be the case.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
But they certainly are not in any way floating around and I have never known of any of these.

14:58.000 --> 15:08.000
But the FBI or anyone within the FBI has given a report or any part of it to any unauthorized person.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
The general I can conclude this, I should be saying in full justice to the general in here today,

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
that whatever files come to the committees on which I share,

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
are available only under an uninclapped rule so that they're pretty careful guarded,

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
and where it's difficult even in members of the Senate,

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
other seeing a file even where there may be a presumption that they're in solidarity.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
So, like if they conclude by saying that in all of that time,

15:36.000 --> 15:43.000
I have seen exactly one file pertaining to a nominee for a federal position.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
We have reached the 7th inning, we'll take our testimony.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
I think Senator Dirkton, you brought out a very important point,

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
and I believe that you may want to correct one thing in fairness to the FBI.

15:58.000 --> 16:07.000
And that is that the FBI, the my knowledge has never permitted an FBI file to the Congress.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
They've permitted reports, because Mr. Com pointed out very popular.

16:11.000 --> 16:20.000
So that's the only, and I think you want to record that way because of the FBI file as such,

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
for good gives, the source of very information and would give details

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
that they would never release beyond their own agency.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
I don't believe they let an FBI file even over the CIA or the atomic energy commission.

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm not trying to support any case here, but during my four-year service on the Joint Committee on the atomic energy,

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
we received many reports from the FBI, but never an FBI file.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
And then he saw it into the head of a user who worked file and reported rather even changed the way that

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
I certainly say it's very interesting, but he even changed it into what.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
When we talked a lot about files in the committee room, I guess that may have caused some of them.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
I think that should be said in fairness to the federal bureau of investigation,

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
so because they have a new center station.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
You have Dr. Ferret and the chairman, and Larry Breef.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
We're going to have the presentation.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Yes, sorry for me.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
All right, Senator Simon is in that position.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
How fat is it, gentlemen?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Senator McCarthy, have you any questions from Mr. Com's defense?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
It's not with the vet, but Mr. Watt.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
It's a work, you have to admit.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Oh, and I'm going to ask you only one or two questions, and then I have some by Mr. St. Claire.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm the family of the day, and I was questioning you about Chimes' work product while he was a camp dick.

17:43.000 --> 17:50.000
You indicated to me that you thought they were deemed a very little in the way of memorandum or perhaps none.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
Did your search turn out that way or have you found some?

17:55.000 --> 18:05.000
We took that search from a Northland dress, a report on the annual address of the un-Northland address.

18:05.000 --> 18:14.000
The annual report of the subcommittee, we have for a witness thing dealing with confidential informants and witnesses,

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
which we have in its upper folder, the names of which we will not.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
We will disclose to the committee we will not make public though.

18:23.000 --> 18:33.000
We do have, sir, I believe, some memorandum and intensive files that were discussed by investigated footnists, the shine,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
which contains confidential information. They are available to me now.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
And the committee we would not want both made public, maybe I give you a short answer.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
I will say in the way of memorandum, six stated by him, no.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
In the way of no-Sunday address of the annual report prepared by him yet.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Yes, and that's about the limit I assigned.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
I correct my deep down from the check.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.000
I am assigned to say that it would give the folder containing the names of the confidential informants to the committee.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
May I say that I am a correctional man?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yes.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Say that to us.

19:14.000 --> 19:22.000
And can the memorandum of the pretendings of the annual report or report their separate and together out in a form?

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Yes, sir. So they can be examined by me short after five o'clock.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Choice.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Okay, Mr. Sinclair will ask you.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
So, Mr. Colle will be delivered to Mr. Jenkins office.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
If they are already, they are already different.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Mr. Colle, the name of the memorandum has been mentioned many times in these hearings.

19:40.000 --> 19:51.000
I don't know whether or not he specifies it, but it is a fact at the time that the memorandum is clear for security reasons was lifted in January of 1950.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Is that correct?

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
I think so. I understand it's yet I know it was one of General Watten's first acts on becoming commanding General.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
It's better to have refused to fill us in here tonight.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
And so that he had no clearance at all from January 1952 until today as far as we know.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
No, but he was so working out at the Fourth Monument.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
Well, actually, he was working and telling that wasn't even on the post at Fourth Monument. Isn't that the fact?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I don't know that.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
You don't know that?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
No.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, you know he was working in a building that wasn't at all garbage.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
No, I don't know that.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
You didn't know that.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
No, sir.

20:29.000 --> 20:36.000
But you are frequently clear that this man had no clearance whatsoever from January 1952 on.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Ah, yes.

20:37.000 --> 20:45.000
And you know that the act of which he had been fired, the 30-minute, several years fired, and the secretary of Siemens was ministrating the Army, so you know.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But the act has been committed yet.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Certainly most of them had there.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I'm just wondering whether they were one thing that had occurred.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
So I would say that they had a occurred prior to Siemens's ministry.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And several years fired of that.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
Yes, the most recent thing which I recall is the interview we had with the FBI in which he admitted to the FBI.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
It's not been truthful to the FBI.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
And when was that?

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
Stop, I think, was 51 or 52 in a WISDV4 with the Siemens administration.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
You would be right.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
That's correct.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
Mr. Siemens took office in Section 2 of the Army, I believe, in February of 1963.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yes, sir.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
Now I'd like to talk with you, Mr. Kohl, and a little bit about the Fourth Moments investigation.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
This is quite a complicated subject.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
This is not.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yes, sir.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
You stated, I believe, that your preliminary investigation

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
started in early spring of 1953.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Where does that originate?

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
And that, as I believe, your first hearings were actually held,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
commenting October 8, 1953.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
Are you throwing a distinction between Fort Monmouth, specifically, in the Army's signal course?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Well, we'll get to that in a moment.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
But the first hearings at Fort Monmouth were in October 8, 1953.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Is that right?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I would say yes.

22:13.000 --> 22:19.000
On August 30th, you held a hearing in which involved an employee of the signal course, that's correct.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Yes.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
That employee was employed in the Guardian, Long Island in New York.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
What is his security, sir?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
That's correct.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Long Island in New York.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
That's the signal call for the graphic club.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
That's correct.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
Now, as I understand it, Mr. Kohl, you, in substance faith,

22:37.000 --> 22:45.000
that since we interrogated a guard at an installation of the signal course in Long Island New York,

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
we are responsible for all the sentences that were made by the Army's following that date.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Is that correct?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
No.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
Certainly, if the Army signal call in California had suspended any security risk,

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
you would not plan credits for those, would you?

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I know of no instance in which we should have been.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Your answer to the question would you?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Would we claim credits for those?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Yes.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
No, sir.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
They're all about to call in California.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
They're going to investigate it.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
They're going to investigate it.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
They're going to investigate it.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
I'm sorry.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
You were directly saying, unless we had an I know of no situation in California involving the Army signal call,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
which we had investigated.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
No.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
Well, in so far as the Army was concerned, and in so far as you know,

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
the Army didn't know about the sport-moneless investigation until early in October.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
That's correct.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
No, that's wrong, sir.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
They didn't know.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Are you sure of that?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
I'm positive.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
When do you think that was very serious?

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
You first learned of the impending sport-moneless investigation?

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
Well, I know that he knew it as a substance exchange.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Are you sure of that?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I'm dead positive.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
You had a conference with him, Mr. Colvin, on October 22nd in his office.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Did you not?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Yes, sir.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
What was the subject matter of that conference?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
There were two or three things discussed, uh,

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
the thing dealing with sport-moneless, which I assume you want me to talk about Mr. Tankware, was this?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
We had a...

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Well, my question at the moment is simply what was the subject matter of the discussion?

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
If you could go on beyond that, if you cared it, but it's not right.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
I was afraid that I asked for a Fourth Amendment, uh, General Parkridge,

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
Communist Literature and personnel in all the intelligence, uh, Dave Shines.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
Well, the memorandum of that day, which Mr. Frank Tarr is then to have written,

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
is pretty much however to the fact that you meant the Secretary of State to discuss

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
General Lawson's Fourth Amendment, and it's locked out order, isn't that correct?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Yes, sir.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
You wonder what it is?

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
And isn't it true, sir, that the principal subject of stuff at this conference on October 2nd was Fourth Monument?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Uh, I think you're right.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Thank you, sir.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
That's right. Now, this was a conference that was made as a result of a report appointment by you, is that correct?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Yes, sir.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
And we had some telephone conversations about that yesterday, didn't we?

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Yes, sir.

25:10.000 --> 25:19.000
And I call your attention to the transcript of a telephone conversation on the 25th of September 1953.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
I don't know whether you have copies of these or not, but I assure you I will endeavor to read the matter.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I'm sure you will.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
If I'm only going to read a portion of it, then I think it's material, perhaps others would differ,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
but I'm sure that I'll be fair enough about it.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
In part of that conversation, it's telling you sad, you know,

25:39.000 --> 25:54.000
you said in fact there is a new situation involving a part of your thing that I will tell you about when I see you that looks pretty bad.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
I know they are trying to cover up, so you won't even know about it.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
Now in all fairness, let's call that new thing was the Fourth Monument investigation.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
No, sir. It was not.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
You did say that you would talk with him about it when you saw him.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I just...

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
Now I'm the 30th day of September.

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
Again, I will read to you, sir, a portion of the transcript of that telephone call.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
Mr. Com, two things. Number one, that thing I told you about,

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
I will probably be ready to tell you about him a day or so.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
It is a pretty big situation.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
I will check the final word on it tonight.

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
Again, Mr. Com, at all fairness, what you were talking about at that time was Fourth Monument investigation.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Is it not?

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
A scientific statement. It was not the fact that we were investigating Fourth Monument, Mr. Stevens knew that.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
It was an aspect of that investigation.

27:00.000 --> 27:07.000
Well, you say, Mr. Stevens knew that, Mr. Com, but I'll read to you again a portion of your telephone conversation with him.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
I will probably be ready to tell you about it in a day or so.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
And this was September 30, wasn't not Mr. Com.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Then, I think I'll summarize the rest of it.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
You asked for an appointment.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
And then in substance you said, is Friday a good day?

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Why don't I call you tomorrow and make an appointment for Friday?

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
You see, tonight, there's other things just crystallize.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
And I possibly should get an accumulation of things to talk to you about.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
And as a result of that, you had a conference on Friday with the Secretary,

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
which is October the 2nd, in which you decide to support Monument's situation. Isn't that right?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
That's right.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
Now, do you still say, Mr. Com, that you told Secretary Stevens for the first time,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
as early as September 16 that you were going in the fort month?

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
It might have been before that. I know that we talked about it on September 16.

28:03.000 --> 28:10.000
But you were pretty vague about it, and we're not glad to talk much on the phone on September 30.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
It's not about your time, it's just expired with two minutes.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Let's think over, we're talking about two different things.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Well, I thought, Mr. Stevens, on the 16th and it might have been before that,

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
we had to cut the fort month's investigation with Mr. Stevens.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
What I was talking about, all the time, what I thought from the bottom of my person,

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
was a specific situation which had developed in the course of that investigation,

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
on which I thought he felt I hoped he was going to take some action, which he did.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Mr. Jenkins, great.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Chairman.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Chair, we'll just find it here in ten minutes to distribute to the press now, Mr. Beckley.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
The investigation has arrived, and the young man takes them for the radio.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
I was committee member, it hasn't, Mr. Wolf hasn't, Mr. McCarthy has one,

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
Chair, I'll say, enough copies for our absentee members, and you may proceed with this.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
You can do that as far as possible, we'll continue that on with the hearing.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
There's Mr. Robert Scott, and the radio and television gallery,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
and they're all back to you at the Senate press conference.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
One other question, I believe, is this time.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
Mr. Coombs, where there's statements published, and certainly some statements

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
that were made around nearby numbers of the press, I believe, that they are seen

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
both two and a third page documents.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Did you release this to the press?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
No.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
You don't have it, got it?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
No.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
How many copies of it did you have in your file?

29:46.000 --> 29:54.000
I think there was just one, I think, after that sound, it was probably a additional copies of the magazine.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
I know he gave one of somebody, I'm Mr. Jenkins, and I don't know how many were made after that.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
The magazine will make some of the parts of those that are just this yet.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
It will have to come from those original documents in the view of the magazine.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
I don't know, I know, I know, I know, in any other way, that's not known, I don't know where they got.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I think they did.

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
Open back one of the majors of just enough security information, just up to the public.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Why don't I get a picture?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
You don't think that's anything?

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
I know, you don't think that the system's been made to go out to the public, I'll say this.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
There's nothing in this particular document by the paper of it.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
So I don't know what it is, but it's comfortable, I don't know.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
I don't think there's anything in that part of it, but we, I couldn't go out to the public,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
so I don't know where they're going to go.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
We certainly did not really want to know about that.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Now, you don't know about it?

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
You haven't heard about it, you're in the end of the course.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Any members of the course?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I think you read that article.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
I think they're worth it, they're touching here, I think, kind of the timing to spend the time in the jacket.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
You don't know about what they thought, I'm not...

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
you
