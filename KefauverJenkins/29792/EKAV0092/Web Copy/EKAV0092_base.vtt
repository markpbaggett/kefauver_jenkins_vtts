00:00.000 --> 00:13.760
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I am Estes Kefover.

00:13.760 --> 00:19.360
I'm speaking to you from the NATO Parliamentary Conference in Paris France.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.760
This is a meeting of the delegates selected by the Congresses and

00:22.760 --> 00:26.360
Parliament of the 15 NATO countries.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.400
I accepted appointment as a member of the United States delegation because I

00:30.400 --> 00:36.480
believe this meeting is of vital importance to our own safety at home and through the

00:36.480 --> 00:43.480
NATO organization in the, I offer to have solidarity among the nations of the

00:43.480 --> 00:48.280
North Atlantic, Western Europe and of the United States.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.280
As we have met here, two Sputniks have been constantly encircling the globe which

00:52.280 --> 00:58.600
reminds us of the scientific contest that we are engaged in today with the

00:58.600 --> 01:04.320
Communist World and of the necessity of the people who believe in freedom, democracy,

01:04.320 --> 01:08.560
decency, joining together as closely as possible.

01:08.560 --> 01:14.960
Furthermore, in December just three weeks from now, the NATO Council, the heads of

01:14.960 --> 01:18.800
states, will meet here in the same building in Paris France.

01:19.520 --> 01:24.240
And we feel that the suggestions and the work of the Parliamentarians will be helpful in

01:24.240 --> 01:26.400
paving the way for them.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.400
I'm very proud to have with me today a very distinguished delegate, a member of

01:31.400 --> 01:36.680
Parliament from the United Kingdom, Mr. Jeffries, Jeffries Diffrétis.

01:36.680 --> 01:44.360
Mr. Diffrétis, let me say is one of the outstanding and great men in the

01:44.360 --> 01:50.640
Parliament of our friendmen, our great friend and ally, great Britain.

01:50.640 --> 01:56.840
One of these days, Mr. Diffrétis will probably be the Secretary of Air or the Secretary

01:56.840 --> 02:00.680
of Defense, he is a leading member of Parliament.

02:00.680 --> 02:05.840
Mr. Diffrétis and I have had the pleasure of serving together on the so-called political

02:05.840 --> 02:09.600
committee of the NATO Parliamentary Association.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.600
Here's our position, is that a rapporteur.

02:12.600 --> 02:18.080
Now that is aware if it's not a function that's not used, we don't know much about it in

02:18.080 --> 02:20.080
the United States.

02:20.080 --> 02:25.000
But it means that he is the chief man on the committee, that he prepares the report and

02:25.000 --> 02:30.760
he prepared an excellent political report, that he gets the consensus of opinion about

02:30.760 --> 02:35.520
the resolutions and the proposals to be made, that he then grabs the proposals.

02:36.520 --> 02:43.200
And it takes the lead in that debate and has done it splendidly when they proposals

02:43.200 --> 02:49.360
or the resolutions come before the general session of the NATO Parliamentary Conference.

02:49.360 --> 02:55.360
And it's been very remarkable that all of our resolutions were accepted unanimously.

02:55.360 --> 03:01.800
And that's due to great extent to the fine draftsmanship and explanations and through

03:01.800 --> 03:06.000
the standing and influence of my friend here, Mr. Diffrétis.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.800
Certainly, I'm happy to have you on this program, Jeffrey.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.800
Thank you very much, Charles.

03:11.800 --> 03:18.640
Let me ask, are you, um, Ben to the United States, a great deal?

03:18.640 --> 03:20.120
And, yes, I have.

03:20.120 --> 03:23.240
I've actually been in 47 now, to the 48 states.

03:23.240 --> 03:28.120
Well, then I know if you've been in 47 now, to the 48, you must have been through the

03:28.120 --> 03:29.720
great volunteer state of Plannis.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.720
I have.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.720
I wouldn't have died calling this program if I didn't get the other one at this.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.720
And, uh, when was it you were there, Jeffrey, in Tennessee?

03:37.720 --> 03:40.720
Well, in Tennessee, that was, um, in 1935.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.720
Well, I must have been a very, very young man at that time.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.720
Well, I was studying at Yale at the time, and so I had a look at the south.

03:47.720 --> 03:52.720
Well, I went to school at Yale, I'm not saying I'm a study, but I think...

03:52.720 --> 03:58.720
And I think you, uh, also married a very lovely American girl.

03:58.720 --> 03:59.720
I did, I did so.

03:59.720 --> 04:04.720
So, then we have a lot in common, and we certainly are happy to have Mr. Fredas, as I

04:04.720 --> 04:05.720
are guests today.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.720
Well, you tell us, uh, what you think about the work of the conference and, uh, the importance

04:10.720 --> 04:11.720
of the conference, Jeffrey.

04:11.720 --> 04:16.520
Well, I've been, uh, one of the most important features of the fact that Senator Keith

04:16.520 --> 04:21.720
Ferber was elected chairman of the political committee, the committee, he's referred to.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.720
You see, before you go off...

04:23.720 --> 04:26.920
Yeah, I wanted to just, uh, tell the, uh, my friends in Tennessee that I didn't put you

04:26.920 --> 04:27.920
up to...

04:27.920 --> 04:29.920
I know that, but you...

04:29.920 --> 04:33.920
Rather, uh, built me up a little bit by saying I was the most important man in the committee.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.920
I just wanted to make it, uh, straight, uh, Senator Keith Ferber was elected chairman by

04:38.920 --> 04:40.920
the 15 countries, and it's true, I was rapporteur.

04:40.920 --> 04:46.920
But that meant to see that, as rapporteur this committee, I had to work very first to, uh, the

04:46.920 --> 04:50.920
chairman, so I've seen a, uh, good deal of, uh, uh, uh, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I have, I've

04:50.920 --> 04:51.920
been doing a lot of few days.

04:51.920 --> 04:56.920
I think the most important point that we've done is to, uh, uh, one of the most important

04:56.920 --> 05:05.920
things we've decided was to accept the resolution, looking right ahead to, uh, the conference,

05:05.920 --> 05:12.920
governmental conference, to study the Atlantic community and what it really was based on.

05:12.920 --> 05:18.920
Well, uh, Jeffrey, in that connection, we have a political committee reported two resolutions,

05:18.920 --> 05:24.920
uh, first was how they, uh, have, uh, this NATO parliamentary association be the nucleus

05:24.920 --> 05:32.920
around which a great citizens Congress, uh, would be held in 1959, the 10th anniversary of the

05:32.920 --> 05:35.920
NATO treaty, uh, North Atlantic treaty.

05:35.920 --> 05:41.920
This would be in the nature of a, hey, conference, I believe, uh, will you tell us how you envisioned, uh,

05:41.920 --> 05:43.920
yeah, it's great conference.

05:43.920 --> 05:50.920
And, uh, in 1959, being the anniversary of 10th anniversary, we'd have a, uh, get together of all

05:50.920 --> 05:57.920
people representing institutions, organizations, and so on, who are interested in bringing the

05:57.920 --> 06:00.920
country's round the Atlantic closer together.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.920
And they would have a, uh, discuss it.

06:03.920 --> 06:08.920
Ten years ago, there was a similar conference, um, in Europe, and it had a great, it had

06:08.920 --> 06:13.920
had a great results in making European nations realize how much they had in common, I'm

06:13.920 --> 06:14.920
very important.

06:14.920 --> 06:19.920
I believe the hate conference in 1948, at which Mr. Churchill and, uh, great minute distinguished

06:19.920 --> 06:26.920
Europeans, uh, were present and spoke, uh, resulted in the Strasbourg, the creation of the Council

06:26.920 --> 06:31.920
of Europe, and many other, very worthwhile things that have been done to bring the European community

06:31.920 --> 06:32.920
together.

06:32.920 --> 06:33.920
Didn't it?

06:33.920 --> 06:34.920
Yes, it did.

06:34.920 --> 06:39.920
And that Council of Europe has provided twice a year opportunity for members of parliament

06:39.920 --> 06:42.920
and different countries in Europe to meet and discuss common problems.

06:42.920 --> 06:47.920
They don't, they can't take any executive action, but they can, uh, there are different points

06:47.920 --> 06:49.920
of view, and that's a enormous importance.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
Yes, it is.

06:50.920 --> 06:55.920
And, uh, I think we also envisioned this, uh, hate conference on the 10th anniversary of the

06:55.920 --> 07:02.920
North Atlantic Treaty, to, uh, from, uh, be a time for people back home to talk about and think

07:02.920 --> 07:07.920
about and study, uh, NATO problems, the problems of the Atlantic community.

07:07.920 --> 07:13.920
Because we realize that NATO will only be as strong and, and as effective as it, uh, has

07:13.920 --> 07:18.920
backing from the people, and this will be a time of, uh, mobilization of that public backing.

07:18.920 --> 07:25.920
The, uh, other, uh, other, uh, part of this, uh, very important resolution is something that

07:25.920 --> 07:31.920
I've been wishing on for a long, long time in the Congress of the United States, or similar

07:31.920 --> 07:38.920
to it, and that is to set up a conference or a commission, uh, the delegates of which

07:38.920 --> 07:46.160
would be selected by the respective 15 governments of NATO, to, uh, seriously study and to recommend

07:46.160 --> 07:55.360
ways and means of implementing and, uh, the NATO idea of bringing about better cooperation

07:55.360 --> 07:58.920
unity among the nations of the North Atlantic.

07:58.920 --> 08:04.160
I'm very hopeful at, uh, at the meeting here in December that President Eisenhower and

08:04.160 --> 08:07.760
the other heads of state may, uh, implement this resolution.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.080
What do you think about this, this general idea?

08:10.080 --> 08:11.600
I think it's a statement.

08:11.600 --> 08:14.520
I think it, the two of them fitting very well.

08:14.520 --> 08:20.680
One is the, the big Congress and this, the other one, and I, I believe the governments

08:20.680 --> 08:28.040
meeting next month, when everyone's, this well-aware importance now of NATO and this

08:28.040 --> 08:31.720
alliance that they will go forward and set up such a conference.

08:31.720 --> 08:36.400
Everything to me that in a three-day meeting such as, uh, this will be, uh, three weeks

08:36.400 --> 08:42.480
from now with heads of government here that, uh, they can only agree upon general principles

08:42.480 --> 08:49.040
that the implementation that details will have to be worked out by commission or conference

08:49.040 --> 08:54.800
and, uh, this, uh, recommendation, uh, hope will fit what they may do at that time.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.960
And I know that there's no harm at least from talking things over.

08:58.960 --> 09:05.040
Uh, Jeffrey, we had, uh, one estimate in the conference, uh, unfortunate one growing

09:05.040 --> 09:12.340
out of the, uh, decision of the United Kingdom and the United States to send arms to the

09:12.340 --> 09:13.340
nation of Tunisia.

09:13.340 --> 09:15.340
Will you, uh, tell us what happened?

09:15.340 --> 09:20.720
Yeah, next thing is that, well, it is right, we're, we're in France and you really have

09:20.720 --> 09:26.320
to be here to realize how extremely touchy the French are about anything that appears

09:26.320 --> 09:31.800
to be helping the nationalists in Algeria.

09:31.800 --> 09:38.280
And of course, this has been construed in the way that it, the, the legs that arms would

09:38.280 --> 09:41.640
go from Tunisia into Algeria.

09:41.640 --> 09:46.000
And of course, the emotions of very charge are for old French hair people, fighting where

09:46.000 --> 09:47.800
they can't be killed out.

09:47.800 --> 09:53.500
And one manifestation of it was that the French, derogation here, all the French members of

09:53.500 --> 10:00.120
parliament, um, as a protest against the action of the two governments, the British and American,

10:00.120 --> 10:01.840
left the conference walk right out.

10:01.840 --> 10:05.440
It might, in my opinion, it was a silly thing to do because you gained nothing by walking

10:05.440 --> 10:07.920
out, but just not there to put your own point of view.

10:07.920 --> 10:12.360
Uh, yes, well, I certainly agree that, uh, walking out doesn't do any good.

10:12.360 --> 10:18.960
And, uh, as you say, they can be more effective if they stay in the meeting and, uh, present

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
their point of view.

10:19.960 --> 10:24.480
And, uh, I think it's fair to say that there's a great deal of sympathy with the French

10:24.480 --> 10:25.480
position.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.960
Uh, I can certainly understand how they feel about it.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.920
Uh, I believe that one, uh, thing that was not done in this connection and, uh, I think

10:34.920 --> 10:41.160
this was a mistake, uh, not to have done it was that the members of NATO, the NATO ministerial

10:41.160 --> 10:48.400
council and Mr. Paul Enre's, Bob, the, uh, Secretary General of NATO was not, he was

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
not informed.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.560
There was no consultation between the members.

10:51.560 --> 10:57.280
So that this is, uh, one of those things that is disrupted our unity and it is something

10:57.280 --> 11:03.240
it should have been discussed all the way around, uh, by the NATO ministerial, uh, group

11:03.240 --> 11:08.800
before any action was taken because France is a great and precious friend of the United

11:08.800 --> 11:10.280
States and United Kingdom.

11:10.280 --> 11:16.280
And we don't want anything to happen that's going to permanently disrupt your eye or cause

11:16.280 --> 11:23.160
a, uh, this unity with, uh, France, we certainly hope they will come back in the conference.

11:23.160 --> 11:28.400
And I hope that in the future that our State Department may, uh, handle matters differently.

11:28.400 --> 11:33.600
I'm not very, I doubt very much the wisdom of what they did, but certainly the way they

11:33.600 --> 11:34.600
did it was bad.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.600
Yes.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.240
But, Devere, will you tell us some of the other, uh, outstanding achievements of this, uh,

11:39.240 --> 11:40.240
conference?

11:40.240 --> 11:44.520
On that very point, of course, we passed our committee offered a resolution, which was

11:44.520 --> 11:49.840
accepted, unanimous, they just, to moment, just, um, this morning on this very matter.

11:49.840 --> 11:55.040
That is to say the importance, stressing the importance of consultation between the nations.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.640
And then, uh, there's a, um, there's a scientific point.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.280
I think that's an important one.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.280
Yes.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
Why don't you say a word about the, uh, scientific?

12:01.280 --> 12:06.800
Well, it's just that we've all, we've accepted the resolution of the fate of pooling of

12:06.800 --> 12:10.680
scientific and technical manpower among the NATO countries.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.520
The general principle is that it's an up to us to implement it.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.720
That was, uh, really an implementation of our President Eisenhower and Prime Minister

12:17.720 --> 12:20.320
Macmillan agreed upon in Washington sometime back.

12:20.320 --> 12:25.000
And that, uh, report incident, it was presented by Senator Henry Jackson from the state of

12:25.000 --> 12:28.200
Washington, who was a great friend of us in Tennessee.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.840
Well, uh, and Jeffrey, this is about all the time we have.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.440
We want to extend you a welcome to come down to our state.

12:35.440 --> 12:39.860
Uh, we hope you will come down and see the Tennessee Valley Authority again, like

12:39.860 --> 12:40.860
you.

12:40.860 --> 12:44.700
And, uh, we'll be very happy to see you and it's been a great pleasure to be on this

12:44.700 --> 12:45.700
program.

12:45.700 --> 12:46.200
Thank you very much.
