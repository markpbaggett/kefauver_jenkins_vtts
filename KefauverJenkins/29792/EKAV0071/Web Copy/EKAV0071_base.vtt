WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.760
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we have a great treat in store for us today.

00:12.760 --> 00:17.160
This is the first time this has happened to me and I am very honored that we have with us

00:17.160 --> 00:21.040
one of America's great and fine citizens.

00:21.040 --> 00:27.520
Somebody that you all know or read about or admire, former heavyweight champion of the boxing

00:27.520 --> 00:29.720
champion of the world, Jack Dempsey.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.720
Jack Good to see you.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.720
Thank you very much, Senator.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.520
It's a great privilege and a great honor to be here with you today.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.120
Thank you very much.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.240
Well, Jack Dempsey is in Washington today.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.240
He's been autographing.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.000
Jack, I see your hands are pretty, uh, thank you.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Yes, I need a little bath on this, Senator.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.760
I'll be a picky panel.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.200
Sports Illustrated has a special feature.

00:49.200 --> 00:56.480
They are three greatest champions in ten sports and Jack Dempsey, Sugar Ray Robinson and

00:56.480 --> 01:01.280
Joe Lewis are the old hand champions in the sport of boxing.

01:01.280 --> 01:06.720
Jack's been here, autographing, sports illustrated and also Jack, I want to get a cut on this

01:06.720 --> 01:15.280
role, but, uh, Robert Consta De Han wrote a great book, uh, Dempsey the Man.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
That's right.

01:16.280 --> 01:20.080
And you've been autographing a lot of books and so if we sell any on this program, I want

01:20.080 --> 01:21.080
you to be sure and remember me.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
I certainly will, Senator.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
Thank you.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
How are you feeling, Jack?

01:24.080 --> 01:25.080
Very well, Senator.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.080
Thank you.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.480
I just got back from Honolulu where I was out there for the Armed Forces and had a wonderful

01:30.480 --> 01:33.440
time and wonderful trip, met a lot of wonderful boys.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.840
I hope we made a lot of people happy because they certainly made me happy.

01:36.840 --> 01:43.120
Well, uh, as you folks know, uh, Jack Dempsey is spending a lot of time, uh, doing charities,

01:43.120 --> 01:47.960
traveling around the world, putting on shows, uh, without any compensation for the benefit

01:47.960 --> 01:51.800
of our men in the service who are serving abroad.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.800
And I know they're always led to city.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.760
So you show a lot of pictures of former fights and then talk about fighting at these.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.360
Well we had, Senator, we had what they call a boxing clinic.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.000
I had a man named Al Warden, a sports head with me.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.600
First, uh, I was introduced and he was introduced.

02:05.600 --> 02:10.320
But before all of this, we had pictures of some of the old fights and we had a picture

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
of this year life.

02:11.320 --> 02:15.160
The picture lasts for about a nine or fifteen minutes and we talked about a nine and we had

02:15.160 --> 02:18.520
about a nine and a half for questions and answers.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.080
That about three hours and three and a half hours you'll be sure.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.440
Jack, how'd you get this title of the man, uh, Manassee Muller?

02:25.440 --> 02:30.320
Well, that was given to me, Senator, but the late Damon Rullion, Damon saw me fight in Colorado

02:30.320 --> 02:35.160
where I was born and raised and when I came to New York in 1960 and he called me the

02:35.160 --> 02:36.160
old manassee Muller.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.320
So that's how I, that's entitled.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.320
It was followed you every cent.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.760
But he good luck and I kind of liked it.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.400
Not the old manassee Muller, the young manassee Muller.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.960
But then it was the manassee Muller but later on it got to be the old manassee Muller.

02:47.960 --> 02:48.960
Exactly.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.600
I don't like too much now, but it's all right.

02:50.600 --> 02:55.600
Jack, you told me how old you were a few minutes ago and you mind saying again?

02:55.600 --> 02:56.600
Not at all.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.600
Senator, I'll be 66 in June, June 24th.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.200
I'll be 66 years old.

03:01.200 --> 03:07.040
Well, I just told you that if I look as healthy and you weigh 215 pounds, that's right, Senator.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.240
It's healthy as you do when I get to be 66, I'll be mighty fortunate.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.240
Well, thank you very much.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.240
I think you look wonderful.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.280
Well, Jack, uh, didn't a lot of your people come from Kentucky?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
Uh, Tennessee?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.280
Yes.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.880
Uh, my people, most of my people and mother was born in Virginia.

03:19.960 --> 03:26.880
My father and West Virginia and part of my family were in down in Tennessee and down Kentucky, down through there.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.280
And you and all about these Tennessee and Kentucky ham?

03:29.280 --> 03:30.280
I certainly do.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.280
I was more or less raised on this.

03:32.280 --> 03:37.480
Well, Jack, we were looking over your record here a little while ago and we found that, uh,

03:37.480 --> 03:41.280
you fought a lot of times down in Tennessee, I believe that, uh,

03:41.280 --> 03:45.440
like in 1918 you fought Fred Sadi and Memphis, Tennessee.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
Do you remember that?

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
Yes, I remember very well.

03:47.440 --> 03:52.320
I had boxed on that several times and had a wonderful time, we used to be a great sports center.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.160
And that's Seiford, I believe, you fought him.

03:54.160 --> 03:58.840
I just happened to think the name of the old promoter down there was Billy Hack, wonderful man,

03:58.840 --> 04:01.400
a great promoter and a lot of good fighters came around there.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.560
I'm sure a lot of people in Memphis still remember him.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.480
Oh, they certainly do, I'm sure.

04:05.480 --> 04:11.800
And then, uh, and shows you that in 1926 you had four opponents in Memphis and you knocked

04:11.800 --> 04:15.520
them all out in, uh, one, one, well, that was a nice abyss in tour.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.320
I remember that too, but they weren't too good.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.440
Well, Jack, where did you, uh, when they, every week titles?

04:21.440 --> 04:27.120
I won the titles from Jess Waller July 4th, 1919 at Toledo, Ohio.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.360
And, uh, I remember that I was a high school student at Madisonville and in those days,

04:31.360 --> 04:34.320
uh, that's a little town over in East Tennessee.

04:34.320 --> 04:40.320
Those days there wasn't any television, no radio, and, uh, all of us went down to the railroad station

04:40.320 --> 04:44.160
to get the return of the fight, that's all we could get around after round.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.200
And I remember when you won the, every week champion.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.520
What, uh, was that a rough fight?

04:50.520 --> 04:52.200
Well, it was a big thing for me.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.200
And, of course, everyone must be a fighter.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.200
There is a fighter.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.200
I have one ambition that's to be tied up to win the title.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.200
Of course, that was my big day and big thrill.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.040
But after thinking over and looking back all these years, it wasn't the tough fight.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.040
It was an easy fight for me.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.840
Matter of fact, one of the easiest fights I ever had because it was a one-sided fight.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.040
Waller was big and strong, but he was very slow.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.080
He's been out of the game for a couple years, and it made it a very easy fight for me.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.080
What were your hardest fights, so you ever had?

05:17.080 --> 05:21.080
Well, I'd say Sharky. I should say Tony twice because he'd like to be a footballer.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.080
Well, you know, Jack Sharky, uh, he, you fought him a couple of times.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.080
Yeah, just one time, son.

05:25.080 --> 05:29.080
You know, I was up in New Hampshire, and I saw Jack Sharky sometime back,

05:29.080 --> 05:32.080
and I ran for the Democratic nomination up there a few years ago.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.080
You remember him?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.080
I do.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.080
I ran across this fellow who's out.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.080
He was a great flakcaster to you.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.080
Yes, he does a good job.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.120
Very fine, fellow.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.120
How about the FERPO fight?

05:44.120 --> 05:46.120
Well, I was probably the Argentinian.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.120
Yes, I was.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
What are you looking at, folks?

05:48.120 --> 05:51.120
And there were a matter of fact, I thought I was fighting in the Philippines.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.120
I was fighting very much, and I should have that up when you're going to knock out myself.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.120
After the first punch, I didn't know that I was in a fighter foot race.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.120
I was knocked out of the ring and came back.

06:00.120 --> 06:04.120
And, matter of fact, I was out about one minute before this starting of the second round.

06:04.120 --> 06:09.120
I came to, I thought, I'd been knocked out, but my manager, Mr. Kern, said I hadn't,

06:09.160 --> 06:13.160
I got lucky and finally knocked him out, but it was a great thrill, and I was pretty lucky.

06:13.160 --> 06:17.160
So I remember he used to have a crouching style. He got right down the...

06:17.160 --> 06:19.160
Well, I said it in the third point, that's it.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.160
I'm low. I'm low. I'm low. I just got through it.

06:21.160 --> 06:26.160
And then you held the championship for quite a long time, of course,

06:26.160 --> 06:31.160
and I believe you lost it to June Tani and Philadelphia in 1926.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.160
Yes, sir.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.160
It's right.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.160
Tani, a great fighter.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.160
Tani was a good fighter, so I'd be a surre.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.200
Then the next year you fought him out at Chicago.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.200
That's right.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.200
And we were talking about that being the battle of the long count.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.200
That's right. That's exactly what it was.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.200
How did that count go?

06:50.200 --> 06:52.200
Well, it turned out very well for me either.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.200
I remember you had him down, and instead of counting fast, the counting very, very slow.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.200
Well, it wasn't that simple. Exactly. They passed this new law,

07:00.200 --> 07:03.200
were a man scoring a knockdown, and she'd go through a neutral corner.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.240
And they had what they called a knockdown timekeeper.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.240
Outside was to pick the count up as a man went down.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.240
The man inside was to put you in a neutral corner,

07:11.240 --> 07:15.240
then you come back and pick the count up and you listen with the man outside.

07:15.240 --> 07:19.240
Well, I made the first mistake, but I was going back to the neutral corner.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.240
And I think the referee made the second mistake, not picking with the count up

07:22.240 --> 07:24.240
and you listen with the man outside.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.240
Now, he got up to about eight, and Tani had that referee started all over.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.240
But I always contend it was a great fight for Jack Dempsey.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.240
Why, sir? You're low.

07:31.280 --> 07:35.280
Well, the reason I say that, a lot of my friends who saw the fight still think I wanted.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.280
As long as I can keep them thanking that, I still say it was a great break for Jack Dempsey

07:39.280 --> 07:41.280
and a tough break for Gene Tani.

07:41.280 --> 07:45.280
Because you're still the champ in the minds of a lot of people, and...

07:45.280 --> 07:48.280
Well, then that may be able to do something else that you want.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.280
Uh, Cendra, it isn't how you start, but it's how you finish.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.280
In other words, they didn't see me on the floor, and they didn't see me caught it out.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.280
In other words, they still remember that fight.

07:56.280 --> 08:00.280
And if I can keep them remember that and have them think the way they do, I'm very happy.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.320
Now, you were talking, we were talking about...

08:02.320 --> 08:05.320
You said something about Jack Kern's a little while ago.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.320
He was your manager? Yes, sir. He was my manager. He was with me when I won the title.

08:09.320 --> 08:15.320
We had him before our Andy Truston, an awfully subcommittee, some time back, and he was still very spry.

08:15.320 --> 08:21.320
He said he had fought in Alaska back in the days of Jack London in those old days, and he said...

08:21.320 --> 08:24.320
Who was that? Was his manager?

08:24.320 --> 08:28.320
I mean, was Jack Kern's manager? Yes, I think.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.360
He was Urb, while Bill Urb's name?

08:30.360 --> 08:32.360
Well, I'll be Urb. Yes.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.360
Jack Kern is about 80, you know.

08:34.360 --> 08:41.360
Well, I don't know exactly how old he is. I think he's got to be up there because I'm 56 under, and he's at least 15 or 20 as I'd think,

08:41.360 --> 08:44.360
older than I am, so he must be around 26.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.360
No, he's 66, sir. You don't look more than 56, but thank you.

08:48.360 --> 08:53.360
Well, uh, uh, Jack, you've been following boxing all these years since that time.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.400
What do you think about present day boxers, is compared with the...

08:57.400 --> 09:01.400
second, the old days when you and Fr. Owen Sharky...

09:01.400 --> 09:05.400
Well, Sunder, I certainly need to want to degrade anyone, or make anyone look bad.

09:05.400 --> 09:10.400
I think the further back we go in the fight game, the more rugged, the more better, and the champion's better fighters.

09:10.400 --> 09:15.400
We had no days because they had more experience in background, and the present modern day fighters have.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.400
I think the old time fighters were better.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.400
Right, they have clubs back in the old days, so you should cut them better.

09:22.400 --> 09:26.400
Well, they fought more often, I think they were better seasoned, and they had better trainers.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.440
In other words, these fellows had long experienced background, and know what to do,

09:29.440 --> 09:33.440
which the modern fighters doesn't get that experience in background, the old time has got.

09:33.440 --> 09:38.440
And, uh, hmm, well, who do you think is the best in the fight game today?

09:38.440 --> 09:44.440
Well, I, and the heavyweight division, I would still say Paterson, because he's still the champion,

09:44.440 --> 09:49.440
but as I said before, I don't think these fellows we have to be compared with the old time fighters.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.480
Uh, did you see the, uh, Joe Hanson, uh, Paterson fight?

09:53.480 --> 09:57.480
I saw the first two fights, but I didn't miss, I didn't see the last one center.

09:57.480 --> 10:03.480
Uh, well, I see, Sonny Liston is, uh, challenging, uh, Paterson, present time.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.480
Uh, how do you think that might come out as they fight?

10:05.480 --> 10:10.480
Well, I don't think Paterson takes a punch any too well, but at the same time he's a good boxer,

10:10.480 --> 10:14.480
he's clever, he moves around good. I saw Liston one fight, and he looked very slow,

10:14.480 --> 10:17.480
and very awkward with the time he fought, uh, Mason.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.520
I think that was important, Oregon last winter.

10:19.520 --> 10:25.520
No, it makes him hit some, of course, he knocked Paterson out, but you gotta hit him in before you knock him out.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.520
And, uh, they, neither one of them take, uh, looks too well.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.520
That's right, they don't take a punch too well.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.520
Uh, and Jack, you're, uh, in addition to doing all your charities,

10:33.520 --> 10:37.520
and you work with the armed services, you have a, a pretty big fine restaurant in New York.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.520
Yes, sir, thank you for listening. Thank you, sir.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.520
Uh, one time I was there and you came in.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.560
Well, now, uh, pretty soon we're going to have hearings about a boxing bill.

10:46.560 --> 10:53.560
We all know that, uh, fighting business has, uh, gotten in many places into the hands of racketeers,

10:53.560 --> 10:57.520
and improper people, and has been degraded considerably.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.520
Uh, has that been your experience here?

10:59.520 --> 11:02.520
Is there any, I send to you, my congratulations, and best wishes.

11:02.520 --> 11:07.520
I only wish we had a few more men who would stick up for the boxing game and put it back

11:07.520 --> 11:11.520
where it wasn't the oldies. The fight game is just about on its way out.

11:11.560 --> 11:15.560
In other words, it's just ready to be buried if something's not done and done fast.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.560
And I've read your, your book.

11:17.560 --> 11:21.520
Well, I've read that before we do that, uh, uh, saving thing about that.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.520
I think the American people want good clean boxing in the hands of good people.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.520
They, they certainly do. They do.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.520
They want to look up to the world champion and know that there isn't any funny stuff

11:31.520 --> 11:33.520
been going on in connection with it.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.520
Uh, I'm certainly going to want to throw a rock scene one, but if the fight game is saved,

11:37.520 --> 11:39.520
it's got to be saved through the government.

11:39.560 --> 11:43.560
You must come in, step in and make these laws where we all know what they're all about.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.520
If we get out of the line, we're not going to play the game.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.520
In other words, you've got to play it on the level.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.520
We've got to have rules and regulations government that because these states cannot get together.

11:52.520 --> 11:57.520
Well, pretty soon we're going to have you down here with a, uh, other great men of the boxing, uh,

11:57.520 --> 12:03.520
game, former champions, June, Tony and others to test fine connection with S1474,

12:03.520 --> 12:08.520
which is for the purpose of cleaning out the racketeers and the boxing game.

12:08.520 --> 12:14.520
Uh, manager is promoters and whatnot so that America, the fighters themselves and American people

12:14.520 --> 12:16.520
can have confidence in it.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.520
Uh, you've been studying this matter.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.520
What's your feeling about it?

12:19.520 --> 12:21.520
Well, I think you're 100% right.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.520
I think there's many things we talked about.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.520
And I think there's many changes can be made for the betterment boxing.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.520
But first, I think you're doing the right thing, but getting rid of the blood of undesirables

12:31.520 --> 12:33.520
who do not belong in the boxing game.

12:33.520 --> 12:40.520
Uh, well, and as you say, uh, some states may have some regulations, some may have others,

12:40.520 --> 12:46.520
and if they have trouble in one state, they simply move on to another and have the fight there.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.520
That's correct.

12:47.520 --> 12:53.520
I think we should have a unified ruling on all these things and a national boxing commission,

12:53.520 --> 12:56.520
whatever you want to call it to see if these players stay in line.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.520
Well, that's the purpose of this bill and you're going to support it.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.520
There's certainly am 100%.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.520
Jack, we have a few minutes left.

13:03.520 --> 13:09.520
Young people, young men, boys, all look up to you and they know that you were a great fighter

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
and a true fine man.

13:11.520 --> 13:17.520
What would be a few seconds your advice to young people who want to build up their physique?

13:17.520 --> 13:20.520
I wouldn't tell them to go in the fight game right now.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.520
But if they like fighting, in other words, do whatever you want to do.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.520
First, I think the most important thing is that, therefore, all the children today

13:26.520 --> 13:28.520
is to get an education, a good background.

13:28.520 --> 13:32.520
If they do that, they go through life, which I didn't have, I've always regarded.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.520
But I think an education is very important.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.520
Then, live with a golden rule.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.520
Do one to others as you'd like to be done by.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.520
And if you do that, you'll get a long fine.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.520
Well, I have others and your churches and you'll be fine.

13:44.520 --> 13:48.520
I wish we could go on to this because I know you have a lot of good advice to give the young people

13:48.520 --> 13:52.520
of the nation, but our time is up and thank you very much, Jack.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.520
Thank you, son.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.520
Mr. Lee, wait.

13:54.520 --> 13:55.520
Pobby's in Pai-Zabie, will you?

13:55.520 --> 13:56.520
Appreciate it tremendously.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.520
That's all for now.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
Thank you.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.520
He was in public life in Washington today.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.520
And has been here for a number of years.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.520
His Adrian Fisher from Memphis.

14:12.520 --> 14:18.520
Adrian goes home and sees all of his kin folks every year.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.520
And his wife comes from Nashville.

14:21.520 --> 14:27.520
His father was a very distinguished congressman from Shelby County District for many years.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.520
And the House of Representatives.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.520
Adrian, we certainly aren't glad to have you here with us.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.520
I'm awful honor to be here.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.520
You want to say hello to all your kin folks down in Tennessee.

14:37.520 --> 14:41.520
Well, I'd like to very much, as you know, a board of Memphis, as you said,

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
my wife's a nice fellow.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.520
And my mother's family, come from Nashville.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.520
And when I first met you, it was a junior chamber of commerce,

14:47.520 --> 14:50.520
and they made me an honor, and I was with Chad and I.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.520
So I feel very much at home when I go home.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.520
Well, that takes you to all parts of the state, all right?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.520
Folks, let me tell you a little bit about Adrian Fisher.

14:59.520 --> 15:04.520
He was a locked lurk for Justice Brandeis and Frank Furter,

15:04.520 --> 15:06.520
when he first got out of Harvard.

15:06.520 --> 15:13.520
He was a legal advisor for the UN delegation, technical advisor at the Neuronburg Trials.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.520
He was the General Counsel for the Atomic Energy Commission.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.520
And he has now, they depredate to John J. Matlowey,

15:19.520 --> 15:24.520
who is President Kennedy's advisor on disarmament,

15:24.520 --> 15:28.520
so that Mr. Fisher has had a great deal of experience in government,

15:28.520 --> 15:32.520
and is one of the most knowledgeable and influential men in Washington.

15:32.520 --> 15:37.520
Adrian, we are talking about the Berlin crisis,

15:37.520 --> 15:42.520
and we are getting our defense establishment in better order,

15:43.520 --> 15:50.520
so that we will be able to take care of ourselves and any emergency.

15:50.520 --> 15:55.520
Why are we doing all this in the same time talking about disarmament?

15:55.520 --> 15:58.520
What is the disarmament program anyway?

15:58.520 --> 16:02.520
Well, as I see it, there are really two sides to the same coin.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.520
I think the President was, of course, right in his speech last week

16:06.520 --> 16:09.520
in terms of increasing our arms strength.

16:09.520 --> 16:15.520
But if at the same time you don't have a willingness to negotiate

16:15.520 --> 16:19.520
a workable arms reduction agreement, workable disarmament arrangements.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.520
We're headed down a road of an unlimited arms race,

16:22.520 --> 16:26.520
and the end of that is one that's not terribly pleasant to contemplate.

16:26.520 --> 16:32.520
My feeling is that at the same time that we remain firm and remain strong,

16:32.520 --> 16:37.520
we indicate a continuing willingness to conduct workable disarmament negotiations.

16:37.520 --> 16:42.520
I don't really see the long run any workable targets.

16:42.520 --> 16:48.520
What was it that Western Churchill said one time about working for disarmament?

16:48.520 --> 16:52.520
Well, he said we are armed at parly, and it seems to me you have to have a little bit of both.

16:52.520 --> 16:58.520
You can't negotiate from weakness, and the other hand you can't just arm for the sake of armament.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.520
You've got the arm for workable arrangements.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.520
Where the Mr. Matlow is, the chief and you, the deputy,

17:04.520 --> 17:08.520
where have these disarmament conversations been taking place?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
What is the situation?

17:10.520 --> 17:14.520
Well, of course you have the test band talks in Geneva that Mr. Arthur Dean is conducting.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.520
The general disarmament talks were disrupted last June,

17:17.520 --> 17:21.520
which was under the previous administration when the Russians walked out

17:21.520 --> 17:24.520
of the Ten Nation Conference in Geneva.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.520
We have been holding some bilateral discussions.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.520
We had two weeks in Washington, June, and two weeks in Moscow, in July.

17:31.520 --> 17:36.520
Mr. McClaulay and his group, of which I was privileged to be won, just got back Sunday.

17:36.520 --> 17:40.520
It does seem strange that I was in Moscow Sunday morning and here Sunday night.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.520
That's the so-so-give-you-sort of indication how small the world is now.

17:44.520 --> 17:48.520
I want to ask you about Moscow in many, but let me ask.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.520
I think all of us hope, and I think the plain people

17:52.520 --> 17:58.520
that we have ever were in the world would like to see us try to do something better

17:58.520 --> 18:03.520
than just prepare for wars and spend all of our sustenance and money,

18:03.520 --> 18:05.520
and manpower preparing for wars.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.520
But of course we have to be prepared.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.520
We have to have our defenses up.

18:09.520 --> 18:16.520
But it's important, as you say, at the same time that we leave no stone unturned

18:16.520 --> 18:20.520
and an effort to try to find some peaceful solution to the problems of the world.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.520
And that's what you're doing.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.520
Well, that's what we're trying to do.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.520
That's what you're trying to do.

18:26.520 --> 18:33.520
Well, we must anyway always be willing to talk if anybody wants to talk reasonably about this problem.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.520
You said that you were in Russia just last week?

18:37.520 --> 18:40.520
Yes, we left Sunday morning.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.520
We left Moscow Sunday morning about 8 o'clock.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.520
Mr. McClaulay was there, and so Mr. Kruchef, I believe.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.520
Mr. McClaulay went to Moscow.

18:48.520 --> 18:52.520
We left two weeks ago Friday and flew over there.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.520
And we spent about a week or so in Moscow.

18:54.520 --> 18:58.520
And Mr. McClaulay, about this time last week, flew down to the Black Sea to Suchi.

18:58.520 --> 19:03.520
And was Mr. Kruchef's visitor for, I think, two nights in a day.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.520
Well, I don't suppose as much you can tell us about Mr. McClaulay's conversations.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.520
Mr. Kruchef, or is there anything you can do?

19:09.520 --> 19:11.520
Well, not a great deal, Senator.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.520
They covered the waterfront to a degree, although Mr. McClaulay was there.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.520
He's only official capacity. Is that dealing with disarmament negotiations?

19:18.520 --> 19:23.520
I think it's fair to say that this is more or less the...

19:23.520 --> 19:27.520
Bring me Kruchef, put you on quite a show.

19:27.520 --> 19:32.520
Yeah, I had a chance about four years ago talking with him while myself.

19:32.520 --> 19:38.520
He was able to manage a saw that would bang the table and get up and walk around talking through an interpreter.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.520
He got all excited, and he put you on quite a show, as you.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.520
Well, he's all excited one minute, and then quite friendly to the next, so I understand.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.520
But I really can't go into any end of detail on it.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.520
Well, you know, what do you have an opportunity to go into Russia when you were there?

19:51.520 --> 19:53.520
Well, I stuck pretty close to Moscow.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.520
I stayed at the hotel, you crane, and walked over to the embassy, and then walked to the conference room.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.520
And I didn't get around very much.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.520
I was sort of tendin' the store during the period of the Suchi Conferences.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.520
We had some work going on in the disarmament delegation, and as the second man,

20:07.520 --> 20:09.520
that was what I was doin' with Mr. McClaulay.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.520
That was out of the city, so to speak.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.520
As you visited any of the country.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.520
Not a great deal, sir.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.520
I was impressed.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.520
Moscow was not as drab as city.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.520
I'm told now it used to be. It still has sort of a drab look to it, but people are still fundamentally very friendly.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.520
You mean, in spite of all of the hit America campaign?

20:26.520 --> 20:30.520
They get propaganda until it must be coming out of the ears, saying what awful people we are,

20:30.520 --> 20:33.520
and yet they'd recognize you as an American in the street.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.520
You didn't detect any on the average Russian.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.520
I'm not talking now about the indoctrinated official, but the average Russian seemed just as...

20:39.520 --> 20:41.520
Curious and as pleasant as...

20:41.520 --> 20:44.520
You'd find someone walking down the streets of Memphis, not your own national jet-nigger.

20:44.520 --> 20:49.520
The average Russian doesn't want to have an all-out atomic war in more than we do.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.520
I'm sure they don't.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.520
These people didn't look war-like to me. They look friendly.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.520
Well, Adrian, where do we go to from now?

20:57.520 --> 21:00.520
What are the plans for the disarmament talks?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.520
Well, we have a...

21:03.520 --> 21:07.520
These talks were tempted to establish a framework for resumed by...

21:07.520 --> 21:09.520
monolateral negotiations.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.520
We wanted to agree at where they would be conducted under what set of ground rules,

21:12.520 --> 21:15.520
and we didn't come to any conclusion on it.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.520
As a result, the bilateral discussions will resume in New York,

21:18.520 --> 21:21.520
I would suspect sometime after Labor Day.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.520
One of the things that we are extremely important though,

21:24.520 --> 21:26.520
and it's important that it be done fairly quickly,

21:26.520 --> 21:30.520
is to get the disarmament activity set up on a statutory basis,

21:30.520 --> 21:33.520
that's the Bill that President Kennedy set up to the Congress,

21:34.520 --> 21:38.520
because it's really important to have your disarmament negotiations

21:38.520 --> 21:45.520
as well prepared and as well organized and as factually well-readed to argue,

21:45.520 --> 21:47.520
as it's humanly possible to be.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.520
And while we've been working pretty hard on it,

21:49.520 --> 21:51.520
we're still not satisfied with the organization,

21:51.520 --> 21:54.520
and we feel that there ought to be a statutory-based organization

21:54.520 --> 21:58.520
to conduct the sort of research and to give you the sort of backup papers

21:58.520 --> 22:00.520
that you really feel that you need.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.520
The stakes on this are just too high to be satisfied with anything

22:03.520 --> 22:05.520
less than the best as far as preparations can take place.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.520
In other words, there are so many trouble points in the world

22:08.520 --> 22:12.520
that are going to have to be settled if we are ready to have this armament,

22:12.520 --> 22:14.520
or any step toward it,

22:14.520 --> 22:18.520
that has to be a great deal of background work done,

22:18.520 --> 22:21.520
and we have to know what we're talking about.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.520
That is correct, sir, and I think you can consider

22:23.520 --> 22:27.520
that we're spending roughly $45 billion a year on the arms side of it,

22:27.520 --> 22:29.520
and a countless number of people,

22:29.520 --> 22:33.520
as you consider private industry, education, and services themselves.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.520
It's pretty important that you have not a big,

22:36.520 --> 22:42.520
but a authoritative and select organization dealing with the disarmament area.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.520
And I know a lot of people say,

22:44.520 --> 22:45.520
well, with Berlin in the areas,

22:45.520 --> 22:50.520
there's no time to be talking about passing a bill dealing with a disarmament agency.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
In the other hand, I can't think of a better time myself,

22:52.520 --> 22:54.520
unless we're prepared to say,

22:54.520 --> 22:56.520
well, I'm going to keep on arming,

22:56.520 --> 23:00.520
keep going on the arms race, and let's come what may.

23:00.520 --> 23:05.520
Well, when you start thinking now about the horrendous quality of modern weapons,

23:05.520 --> 23:10.520
and what could happen in the event of a thermonuclear war,

23:10.520 --> 23:15.520
it really makes you decide that perhaps considering disarmament on a workable basis

23:15.520 --> 23:19.520
is worth spending a good deal more time on,

23:19.520 --> 23:22.520
and a good deal more man hours on than even we're doing now,

23:22.520 --> 23:25.520
and it's been stepped up quite substantially over the past six months.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.520
Of course, in time has passed, we've made a mistake,

23:28.520 --> 23:31.520
I think, in disarmament ourselves,

23:31.520 --> 23:34.520
but the other side's not doing much about it.

23:34.520 --> 23:38.520
This time we're going to be sure that if we take a step that the Soviets,

23:38.520 --> 23:40.520
so the communists are taking a step, is that?

23:40.520 --> 23:46.520
That is certainly true, and now I remember being quite interested in reducing the arm forces

23:46.520 --> 23:51.520
the United States by at least one back in 1945 and 1946,

23:51.520 --> 23:55.520
but we went down from around 13 million to about a million and a half

23:55.520 --> 23:58.520
with absolutely no motion of a similar character,

23:58.520 --> 24:01.520
and nowhere near that much, and found part of the Russians.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.520
Now that was just a mistake, and this mistake I don't think we should ever make again.

24:05.520 --> 24:09.520
I think the unilateral disarming is wrong.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.520
I think the whole purpose of this organization,

24:11.520 --> 24:13.520
the whole purpose of the disarmament effort,

24:13.520 --> 24:19.520
is to work out some arrangement under which the two opposing forces

24:19.520 --> 24:25.520
can put down the amount of time, money, and sweat that they're putting into arms

24:25.520 --> 24:28.520
on a mutually safe basis.

24:28.520 --> 24:32.520
As far as the unilateral disarming of 1945 and 1946 is concerned,

24:32.520 --> 24:35.520
I don't think we should ever repeat that mistake again.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.520
Well, a minute ago you mentioned the Berlin crisis,

24:38.520 --> 24:41.520
and I think that, certainly,

24:41.520 --> 24:46.520
I think most Americans plotted the firm definite stand that the President

24:46.520 --> 24:51.520
Kennedy took in his recent speech in connection with Berlin.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.520
How does the situation look to yours, anything?

24:53.520 --> 24:55.520
You can tell us about the problem.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.520
Well, I was really not much you can add what the President said.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.520
It may seem strange.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.520
I certainly applauded that speech myself,

25:04.520 --> 25:07.520
and far from seeing any inconsistency with it,

25:07.520 --> 25:10.520
and with the willingness to work out a workable disarmament arrangement,

25:10.520 --> 25:17.520
an essential step for an ovenly sound disarmament arrangement to come into being.

25:17.520 --> 25:21.520
I don't think with Kruciep having announced that he increased his own armed forces

25:21.520 --> 25:24.520
roughly 35%, his military budget 35%.

25:24.520 --> 25:28.520
We can say, all right, we're no matter what you do, we're going to say in the same level.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.520
I think that's wrong.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.520
I think what the President did was right,

25:31.520 --> 25:34.520
but I think he indicated he's open to negotiation,

25:34.520 --> 25:39.520
and if we can work out a sound and effective controlled disarmament,

25:39.520 --> 25:41.520
it seems to me will be that much better off.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.520
I thought the President's speech was a step in that direction.

25:44.520 --> 25:49.520
We've got to negotiate, if we negotiate from a position of strength, be successful.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.520
I just forgot.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.520
Well, we have about one minute left.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.520
We have a foreign aid bill that's coming up,

25:56.520 --> 26:00.520
and the Congress is next week, and there'll be a great deal of debate about it.

26:00.520 --> 26:05.520
And what is your general feeling about the aid developing nations

26:05.520 --> 26:08.520
and to our friendly nations in these systems?

26:08.520 --> 26:12.520
Well, Senator, of course, strongly behind that,

26:12.520 --> 26:17.520
I was in on the beginning of this, and 48 working with the Harman Committee on foreign aid,

26:17.520 --> 26:22.520
and although I haven't been on it recently because I've had enough trouble staying ahead of my own work,

26:22.520 --> 26:27.520
all I can say, though, is I know the way that the Congress likes to have an annual check-on.

26:27.520 --> 26:32.520
Things and the big fights you're going to have about authority on a non-annual basis.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
But when you're dealing with re-making the economy,

26:34.520 --> 26:37.520
you have particularly an underdeveloped country, and that's terribly important to us.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.520
It's awfully hard for them to plan on a year-by-year basis.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.520
You don't make economic plans in a year-by-year basis.

26:43.520 --> 26:50.520
No private business does, and it's pretty hard to expect a newly emerging country to do it.

26:50.520 --> 26:56.520
Otherwise, the President ought to be able to make some commitment over a period of two or three or four years and back it up.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
Yes, sir, I'm finished.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.520
You know, sir, I've been counseled on many private firms,

27:00.520 --> 27:03.520
and you're for you entered political life,

27:03.520 --> 27:07.520
but very few private firms make their own plans on a year-by-year basis.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.520
They make them on somewhat larger basis,

27:09.520 --> 27:12.520
and I think the government should be able to do the same thing.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.520
Well, I think it's very deal to that argument.

27:15.520 --> 27:19.520
Well, Adrian, it's sure it's good to have you with us on this program,

27:19.520 --> 27:21.520
and we appreciate very much.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.520
You're telling us about the disarmament program,

27:24.520 --> 27:29.520
and I know that your friends in Tennessee are my glad to see you looking so well and rugged.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.520
Thank you very much, Andy. I appreciate the opportunity to be in here.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.520
That's all for now. Thank you very much.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.520
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

27:55.520 --> 28:00.520
We started out this series of television programs early in January

28:00.520 --> 28:05.520
with a majority leader, Senator Mike Mansfield, of Montana as I guess.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.520
Talk about the program that he expected,

28:08.520 --> 28:13.520
or the Congress expected to enact during this first session of the 87th Congress.

28:13.520 --> 28:17.520
And we wind up our program on this occasion,

28:17.520 --> 28:23.520
because in a few days, the Congress will have recess for the rest of this session,

28:23.520 --> 28:27.520
with another distinguished leader of the Congress,

28:27.520 --> 28:30.520
the whip of the United States Senate.

28:30.520 --> 28:35.520
He is my friend and the very able legislator,

28:35.520 --> 28:41.520
who has had a great part in the enactment of the legislation that we have accomplished during this term,

28:41.520 --> 28:44.520
Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.520
Hubert is certainly as a pleasure to have you on the program with us.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.520
Well, Estes, it's a joy to be on a program with you,

28:50.520 --> 28:57.520
and it's a greater joy, and it's a rare privilege to serve with you in the United States Senate.

28:57.520 --> 29:02.520
And before you get a chance to say one more word about me or about this program,

29:02.520 --> 29:08.520
I want your friends to know and your constituents of this splendid work,

29:08.520 --> 29:14.520
the outstanding work that you have accomplished and undertaken here in the Congress of the United States.

29:14.520 --> 29:22.520
I wish to say to your people that I've never known a man with greater integrity and greater courage in the legislative chamber,

29:22.520 --> 29:23.520
and I want to compliment you.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.520
Well, Hubert, I swear, General, don't be so...

29:25.520 --> 29:26.520
Didn't expect that.

29:26.520 --> 29:30.520
If I had known you're going to say all these things, I'd have had you down here every time I had a program.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.520
And I thank you very much.

29:31.520 --> 29:37.520
And I think that everyone who is watching and hearing this program will know that

29:37.520 --> 29:43.520
Senator Humphrey has been the most active man on the United, on the floor of the Senate during this session,

29:43.520 --> 29:51.520
as he always is, and that the many, many legislative accomplishments of this session are in a great measure due to him.

29:51.520 --> 29:57.520
I don't think anybody sponsored more legislation or fought it through more successfully.

29:57.520 --> 30:02.520
Now, Hubert, first I'm going to explain what the Senate is.

30:02.520 --> 30:05.520
We have the majority leader who has Senator Mansfield.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.520
And the next in command is the Whipple Senate.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.520
He has a big whip, the fights for the program, he gets the members present,

30:13.520 --> 30:22.520
and tries to push the bills through committees to get them in shape so that they can be acted upon intelligently and full debate.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.520
How do you like being with the Senate?

30:24.520 --> 30:26.520
Do you want to tell us more about...

30:26.520 --> 30:27.520
Well, I like it.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.520
...punschibilities?

30:28.520 --> 30:30.520
I like it very much as this.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.520
It takes a lot of time, though.

30:31.520 --> 30:36.520
It does. It takes a great deal of time, but has brought me into closer contact with my colleagues in the Senate.

30:36.520 --> 30:40.520
I think I've gone to have a greater appreciation of their problems.

30:40.520 --> 30:45.520
Besides that, it's a real pleasure to work with Senator Mansfield, the majority leader,

30:45.520 --> 30:52.520
who in his quiet and yet understanding and sincere manner,

30:52.520 --> 30:57.520
is performing a great, or fulfilling a great job as the majority leader.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.520
And his record as a leader, I think, is excellent.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.520
It's been a kind of pleasure to work with it.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.520
Yes, he's a wonderful man.

31:04.520 --> 31:09.520
Well, first let's talk about some of the domestic accomplishments.

31:09.520 --> 31:19.520
Hugh Britt, I think since the World War II has been the busiest session of Congress that I've ever been in.

31:19.520 --> 31:23.520
Yes. We've certainly been very, very busy day and night and in committees.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.520
Let's talk about the domestic scene.

31:25.520 --> 31:29.520
What were some of the accomplishments on the domestic program?

31:30.520 --> 31:43.520
Well, Senator Kiefoffer, the very first thing one ought to say about the Senate is that we have to undertake the confirmation of all of the presidential nominations for these many jobs in the government, these high, these positions of high responsibility.

31:43.520 --> 31:54.520
In the beginning, this took a great deal of our time because each person appointed goes through the process of hearings and testimony and then recommendation by the Committee and action by the Senate.

31:54.520 --> 31:57.520
That within itself is a major accomplishment.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.520
And then we have to ratify all the tributes.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.520
Ratify the treaties, yes.

32:00.520 --> 32:04.520
I would say that our record was really very good.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.520
Now, we have unfinished business, but we have two sessions of the Congress.

32:07.520 --> 32:13.520
Let's just take a look, for example, one of the first acts of this administration when it found a recession on its hands.

32:13.520 --> 32:20.520
It's an inherent inherent in that recession, was to act quickly in the field of temporary unemployment compensation.

32:20.520 --> 32:26.520
The expansion of aid to dependent children of the unemployed.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.520
Now, this went right directly to people.

32:28.520 --> 32:32.520
The President ordered the wider distribution of our surplus food.

32:32.520 --> 32:33.520
That was his first action.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.520
First action, yes, sir.

32:34.520 --> 32:39.520
And then the food stamp plan in certain areas of the United States was put into effect.

32:39.520 --> 32:49.520
And then, Estes, you may recall the minimum wage law, which increased minimum wages to $1.25 and extended the coverage to 3,600,000 more persons.

32:49.520 --> 32:55.520
This was the greatest improvement in the minimum wage law since its original passage under Franklin Roosevelt.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.520
And we had the area redevelopment program.

32:57.520 --> 33:14.520
That's a very important program, Hubert, and it offers an awful lot of hope to people in many areas of Tennessee, because we have depressed areas both in the rural and in other sections of Tennessee, particularly as a result of the Depression and the Cool Man in the House.

33:14.520 --> 33:14.520


33:14.520 --> 33:18.520
Tell us briefly what the area redevelopment bill does.

33:18.520 --> 33:32.520
Well, the area redevelopment bill provides loans for industries and local communities to provide new industries, new job opportunities to improve local communities for new industries.

33:32.520 --> 33:45.520
It also provides grants of money to local governments, when a local government is attempting to build a new factory site or to expand its community facilities.

33:45.520 --> 33:55.520
What the area redevelopment means is a kind of a domestic aid program for our own needy areas and our own underdeveloped areas.

33:55.520 --> 34:00.520
Now, we have an area like this in Northeastern Minnesota, in the Iron Range Country.

34:00.520 --> 34:06.520
You visited that Estes, you have many friends there, just as you have these problems in the coal mining section.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.520
It provides for the retraining of workers.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.520
Yes, right, and the relocation of workers.

34:11.520 --> 34:15.520
And it is, I say, for facilities, for plant equipment, for the improvement of jobs.

34:15.520 --> 34:22.520
Let's move on to some other things. How about social security and highway is airport development?

34:22.520 --> 34:25.520
Yes, we expanded our social security program.

34:25.520 --> 34:29.520
We increased the payments on an average of about 10%.

34:29.520 --> 34:33.520
We took care of the highway program by...

34:33.520 --> 34:37.520
In social security men cannot draw of social security when they reached 62.

34:37.520 --> 34:42.520
age 62, and there were a number of improvements in that social security program.

34:42.520 --> 34:46.520
We are going to, we brought up to date the highway program.

34:46.520 --> 34:50.520
You may remember, under the previous administration, they sort of stretched it out.

34:50.520 --> 34:56.520
Well, we brought it back on to schedule. We advanced more money to the states for their highway construction program.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.520
To get people to work and to take care of the highway needs.

34:59.520 --> 35:06.520
The Airport Act was passed, which will help all of the states in localities with airport development.

35:06.520 --> 35:11.520
We have an awful lot of towns and cities at once, the airport development, too.

35:11.520 --> 35:15.520
And then you recall, we passed the, what we call the water pollution control act.

35:15.520 --> 35:20.520
The congressman Blotnik, who, and he are good friends, from my state, was the author in the house.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.520
And I had the privilege of sponsoring it here in the Senate.

35:23.520 --> 35:30.520
This provides a aid to 5,000 communities for their sewage disposal facilities.

35:30.520 --> 35:35.520
To prevent the pollution of lakes and streams and to really protect the public health.

35:35.520 --> 35:40.520
Then besides that, Senator Keefer, for there was a tremendous program in the field of health.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.520
Your good friend, Lister Hill.

35:42.520 --> 35:47.520
Senator Hill is chairman of that committee on health legislation.

35:47.520 --> 35:53.520
Brought to the Senate the greatest program for the national institutes of health in our fight against cancer.

35:53.520 --> 35:57.520
And against the diseases of the nervous system and against heart disease.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.520
The greatest program we've ever had.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.520
We also have the Community Health Facilities Act.

36:02.520 --> 36:07.520
They will provide their nursing home care and facilities for our elderly.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.520
New hospital construction.

36:09.520 --> 36:16.520
This is without a doubt the largest and the most singularly important act relating to hospital facilities that we've ever passed.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.520
And then the housing bill.

36:17.520 --> 36:24.520
The housing bill too, which I'm not a whole lot in the way of housing, building housing and giving people employment as well.

36:24.520 --> 36:35.520
Then here, but another thing I thought I was very much interested in the wilderness bill to try to preserve some of the natural beautiful places that we have intact.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.520
And that was the past during this session.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.520
Yes, that was that.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.520
There's been one this year fight, you know.

36:40.520 --> 36:44.520
There's been a long, long fight and you've taken a leading part of it.

36:44.520 --> 36:50.520
I suppose one of the disappointments was that we didn't get a full federal aid for education in this session.

36:50.520 --> 36:53.520
What did we get in the way of education, you mean?

36:53.520 --> 36:59.520
Well, we received a two-year extension of the National Defense Education Act, which has been a very successful act, you know.

36:59.520 --> 37:05.520
And then we received a two-year extension of what we call Public Law 815 and 874.

37:05.520 --> 37:12.520
These are laws that relate to helping the school districts in the localities where there's a great deal of federal activity.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.520
Now you have some of that now, Tennessee.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.520
Oak Ridge and Clarksville and Sola Homa many places in Tennessee.

37:17.520 --> 37:25.520
And you know that under those two laws, 815 and 874 are a Senator Kefaw for almost $2 billion of federal aid has been distributed since 1950.

37:25.520 --> 37:30.520
And then we'll be back next term, next session also trying to get some other files.

37:30.520 --> 37:39.520
The president has told us that he's going to press again for a general school program in higher education and an elementary and secondary education in the next session.

37:40.520 --> 37:46.520
We're not giving up any more than, by the way, on our medical care, on our hospital care program for the elderly.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.520
That's going to be one of the prime items.

37:48.520 --> 37:57.520
And the second session, the 87th Congress, starting next January, we're going to put hospital protection for our citizens, age 65, who are under Social Security.

37:57.520 --> 38:08.520
We're going to put it within the Social Security program so that people will not have to undertake a means test and go around asking and begging for something, but it'll be theirs by right.

38:08.520 --> 38:13.520
Yes, and it's not going to be in such fashion that anybody needs to be a Socialized Medicine.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.520
Oh, it relates only to free payment of hospital care.

38:16.520 --> 38:21.520
Now we have a few minutes left to talk about our international affairs.

38:21.520 --> 38:29.520
And you have taken a very leading part and not only a squip of the Senate, but also as a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.520
Just a list and explain what we've done.

38:32.520 --> 38:38.520
The first thing we had, of course, was in connection with Berlin and stepping up our defense effort.

38:38.520 --> 38:43.520
Yes, Senator, you've been very active in that, yourself, as a member of the Armed Services Committee.

38:43.520 --> 38:50.520
You know that we had to add some $6 billion of new appropriations to bring up to date our defense structure.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.520
We found ourselves within adequate forces for the kind of a world in which we live.

38:54.520 --> 38:59.520
And this has been done. We've had a space program, fantastic space program.

38:59.520 --> 39:07.520
Of over a billion and a half dollars, and this had all been lagging, been permitted to sort of be at half pace where we've stepped it up.

39:07.520 --> 39:12.520
We're not going to let the Russians occupy outer space. This doesn't belong to them.

39:12.520 --> 39:15.520
We're catching up and catching up rapidly.

39:15.520 --> 39:22.520
The foreign aid program is not only a new program, but it's a new administration being completely reorganized.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.520
From Washington, D.C., right out to the country level itself.

39:25.520 --> 39:30.520
And the president has insisted upon a new and the infected organization.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.520
We don't want this waste in the program.

39:32.520 --> 39:36.520
We want every dollar that we put into foreign aid to produce some results.

39:36.520 --> 39:40.520
And as you know, most of it today is on the basis of loans.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.520
Repiable in dollars.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.520
And I think this makes a much more sensible program.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
Then we have the people.

39:46.520 --> 39:51.520
And our emphasis has been, but on technical assistance to the economic aid.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.520
That's correct.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.520
That is correct.

39:53.520 --> 39:58.520
What we call the human resources and the material resources of the country.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.520
I mentioned the Peace Corps.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.520
I want to say a word about the Peace Corps.

40:02.520 --> 40:10.520
Every time I talk with people interested in international affairs, they explain the necessity of some method of people to people,

40:10.520 --> 40:18.520
to get into no one another and to help technicians helping people in other nations, particularly the newly developed nations.

40:18.520 --> 40:22.520
Well, this is something that really catches their captures, the imagination.

40:22.520 --> 40:30.520
The Senator who took the lead and putting forth and getting enacted the Peace Corps is Senator Humphrey.

40:30.520 --> 40:35.520
And I think it's one of the most important pieces of legislation that's passed this Congress.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.520
Now you tell us something.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.520
Well, that's a wonderful introduction.

40:38.520 --> 41:01.520
I'll just say very quickly what we're doing is calling upon the young people of our country, trained, experienced, healthy, filled with vitality and idealism and determination and qualified to help other people help themselves, to help them in education and health, in construction and road building, in improvement of the land, in agriculture.

41:01.520 --> 41:11.520
And I'll tell you when you export American youth for the purposes of Peace and for the purposes of building, you help make a better world and you improve the prospects for World Peace.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.520
And the response has been very encouraging.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.520
Then wonderful, Estus.

41:16.520 --> 41:24.520
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I know that you have enjoyed visiting with Senator Humphrey, the equip of the Senate as I have.

41:24.520 --> 41:32.520
We certainly appreciate you being with us, Hubert. This is the last program during this year and I want to thank this station for carrying it as a public service.

41:32.520 --> 41:36.520
Until the beginning of the next session of the Congress. Goodbye.
