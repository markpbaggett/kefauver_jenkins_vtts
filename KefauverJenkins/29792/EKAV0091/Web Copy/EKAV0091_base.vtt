00:00.000 --> 00:20.680
I'm Estus Kiefover. The health of our economy depends on strong competitive private enterprise,

00:20.680 --> 00:25.560
but there are some things private enterprise cannot do without help. Since the depression

00:25.560 --> 00:30.440
we in Tennessee have learned that a workable partnership can exist between free enterprise

00:30.440 --> 00:36.760
and government, and this partnership has strengthened our economy. Two classic examples

00:36.760 --> 00:43.640
are our great Tennessee Valley Authority and REA. TVA dams like the one you see here mean

00:43.640 --> 00:49.400
low cost power which attracts industries to our state. These dams protect our farms and

00:49.400 --> 00:54.840
our cities against floods. And TVA lakes bring millions of tourists dollars into Tennessee

00:54.840 --> 01:00.680
every year. And your TVA's enemies are still working to destroy it. I've been fighting

01:00.680 --> 01:06.560
for TVA ever since it began. I want to keep up that fight. You can help me by re-electing

01:06.560 --> 01:10.160
me to the United States Senate on August 4th. Thank you very much.

01:19.400 --> 01:38.860
I'm Estus Kiefover. You know it takes many years to reach a position in the United States

01:38.860 --> 01:43.640
Senate where you can best serve your state and nation. Only through a long service can

01:43.640 --> 01:48.080
a senator from Tennessee or any state get on important committees where he can work

01:48.080 --> 01:53.480
more effectively for the people. After 22 years in the Congress I am fortunate to be

01:53.480 --> 01:58.320
chairman of two Senate subcommittees. You've been hearing a lot about one of these, the

01:58.320 --> 02:04.160
one investigating had drug prices. I'm also on the Senate Appropriations Committee. This

02:04.160 --> 02:09.440
committee says how much money Tennessee may get for hospitals, highways, airports,

02:09.440 --> 02:16.000
soil conservation, national forest and parks, TVA and many other federal programs. There

02:16.000 --> 02:21.600
are a few Tennessee ins today who say federal aid for our state is wrong. I say federal

02:21.600 --> 02:27.240
aid with no strings attached is right. I believe you feel as I do. You can show that you

02:27.240 --> 02:31.560
do by re-electing me to the United States Senate on August 4th. Thank you.

02:46.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm Estus Kiefover. We in Tennessee know that private enterprise can grow in partnership

02:58.000 --> 03:04.440
with government. Two classic examples are TVA and R.E.A. But TVA's enemies are still working

03:04.440 --> 03:09.280
to destroy it. You can help preserve the TVA by re-electing me as your United States

03:09.280 --> 03:16.280
Senator on August 4th. Thank you.

03:34.120 --> 03:38.880
I'm Estus Kiefover. We in Tennessee know that private enterprise can grow in partnership

03:38.880 --> 03:44.960
with government. Two classic examples are TVA and R.E.A. But TVA's enemies are still

03:44.960 --> 03:50.160
working to destroy it. You can help preserve the TVA by re-electing me as your United States

03:50.160 --> 03:57.160
Senator on August 4th. Thank you.

04:08.880 --> 04:21.180
I'm Estus Kiefover. One of the biggest problems we face at home today is inflation. Another

04:21.180 --> 04:25.920
name for it is the high cost of living. This is a problem that strikes that everybody's

04:25.920 --> 04:31.960
pocketbook in Tennessee and in the nation. I think one of the main causes of inflation

04:31.960 --> 04:37.680
is half prices and unreasonable profits by a big few in some of our vital industries

04:37.680 --> 04:43.080
like steel and drugs. As chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I have fought for years

04:43.080 --> 04:48.080
to stop this spiraling of prices. And I've been fighting also to establish a department

04:48.080 --> 04:52.920
of consumers in the federal government. This is an effort for both consumers and for our

04:52.920 --> 04:58.280
great free enterprise system. But the fight is not finished and there is tremendous pressure

04:58.280 --> 05:03.320
to prevent this effort from going on. I want to continue to work for lower prices for

05:03.320 --> 05:08.280
you and your family. You can help me do this by re-electing me to the United States

05:08.280 --> 05:21.400
Senate on August 4th. Thank you very much.

05:21.400 --> 05:26.520
I'm Estus Kiefover. Inflation strikes that everybody's pocketbook. I've been fighting to

05:26.520 --> 05:31.560
show that a big cause of inflation is excessive profits on a few basic commodities. I want

05:31.560 --> 05:36.080
to keep up this fight. You can help me by re-electing me as your United States Senator

05:36.080 --> 05:46.360
on August 4th. Thank you.

05:46.360 --> 05:52.000
I'm Estus Kiefover. It takes years to attain key positions in the United States Senate.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.360
After 22 years, I am fortunate to be on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which provides

05:56.360 --> 06:01.520
federal aid money to Tennessee. Tennessee can't afford to lose this senior artist.

06:01.520 --> 06:13.400
Re-elect me to the United States Senate on August 4th. Thank you.

06:13.400 --> 06:19.080
I'm Estus Kiefover. One of the biggest problems we face at home today is inflation. Another

06:19.080 --> 06:23.800
name for it is the high cost of living. This is a problem that strikes that everybody's

06:23.800 --> 06:29.840
pocketbook. In Tennessee and in the nation. I think one of the main causes of inflation

06:29.840 --> 06:35.800
is high prices and unreasonable profits by a big few in some of our vital industries like

06:35.800 --> 06:41.360
steel and drugs. As chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I have fought for years to stop

06:41.360 --> 06:46.720
this spiraling of prices. And I've been fighting also to establish a department of consumers

06:46.720 --> 06:51.920
in the federal government. This is an effort for both consumers and for our great free enterprise

06:51.920 --> 06:56.920
system. But the fight is not finished. And there is tremendous pressure to prevent this

06:56.920 --> 07:03.160
effort from going on. I want to continue to work for lower prices for you and your family.

07:03.160 --> 07:08.120
You can help me do this by re-electing me to the United States Senate on August 4th. Thank

07:08.120 --> 07:16.360
you very much.

07:16.360 --> 07:21.680
I'm Estus Kiefover. The health of our economy depends on strong, competitive, private

07:21.680 --> 07:27.400
enterprise. But there are some things private enterprise cannot do without help. Since the

07:27.400 --> 07:32.080

4th. Thank you very much.

10:25.400 --> 10:33.360
Today I want to talk about peace. We all agree that the paramount issue of our time is

10:33.360 --> 10:38.840
peace, the prevention of another war. We want peace with honor. I am proud of what two

10:38.840 --> 10:44.320
democratic administrations have done toward achieving peace over a period of 20 years.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.800
Namaste earners desire is to develop and emphasize the positive and the creative elements

10:48.800 --> 10:54.920
of our foreign policy. And to stress above all when we speak of a policy of strength we

10:54.920 --> 11:00.720
do not mean military strength alone. No, that is not enough. We must be strong economically,

11:00.720 --> 11:07.360
politically and above all spiritually. For without all of these victory is impossible.

11:07.360 --> 11:12.640
The problems which we face in the world today are complex indeed. But if we apply to them

11:12.640 --> 11:19.320
the vision, the energy and the vitality which have combined to produce the America of today,

11:19.320 --> 11:24.400
we simply cannot fail. Thank you for letting me talk with you. I hope that you will support

11:24.400 --> 11:25.400
me.

11:25.400 --> 11:37.040
Next July the Democratic Party will select its nominee for the

11:37.040 --> 11:42.360
presidency of the United States. In the weeks ahead Democrats everywhere will express

11:42.360 --> 11:47.040
their support of the candidates they feel is best qualified. And now one of America's

11:47.040 --> 11:51.240
most distinguished political figures, Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois will comment on

11:51.240 --> 11:55.040
one of the nation's leading presidential candidates, Esther Keef-Hawler.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.760
How do you feel about Senator Esther Keef-Hawler, who is a friend of yours and who has announced

11:59.760 --> 12:04.440
this candidate? Well, Senator Keef-Hawler is one of the finest men in the United States

12:04.440 --> 12:11.440
Senate. He is an absolutely honest man in the first place. Not only incorruptible,

12:11.440 --> 12:16.680
but he won't let anybody else take any money. He is an intelligent man. He is a domestic

12:16.680 --> 12:22.200
liberal, strong for international cooperation. He is qualified in every respect to President

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
the United States.

12:23.200 --> 12:39.120
This is Esther Keef-Hawler. I am campaigning for the presidency. One of the things that's

12:39.120 --> 12:45.200
bothering you and me is the high cost of living. I voted for a strong price control law.

12:45.200 --> 12:49.360
I voted against these amendments such as the key part amendment which have caused prices

12:49.360 --> 12:54.960
to go up. We must continue to try to improve our price control law. There are some strange

12:54.960 --> 12:59.860
things happening in a food price, for instance. There is a big gap that you pay for pork

12:59.860 --> 13:04.860
chops between that and what the farmers are getting for wholves. I believe that Congress

13:04.860 --> 13:10.000
should turn the spotlight on any of these profiteers that may be found. I think that we should

13:10.000 --> 13:15.920
look into the monopolistic influences in processing of food. I am also sponsoring a committee on

13:15.920 --> 13:21.760
consumers where they intended to look into the price discrepancies and to represent

13:21.760 --> 13:27.480
you and me the consumer, just as we have committees representing business, labor and other

13:27.480 --> 13:32.600
elements of our economy. Thank you for letting me talk with you. I hope I may count on your

13:32.600 --> 13:33.080
support.
