00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just keep, Father.

00:09.600 --> 00:15.380
How can we pride ourselves on having the highest standard of living in the world when we

00:15.380 --> 00:21.880
condemn our needy agent, our blind and our physically handicapped to exist on an average

00:21.880 --> 00:28.800
payment of less than $58 a month in order to correct this shameful neglect I have proposed

00:28.800 --> 00:34.860
in the United States Senate that the government assume greater responsibility and public assistance

00:34.860 --> 00:41.760
payments to the state so that we can give our American needy at least $100 a month.

00:58.800 --> 01:12.840
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just keep, Father.

01:12.840 --> 01:19.080
How can we pride ourselves on having the highest standard of living in the world when we condemn

01:19.080 --> 01:25.520
our needy agent, our blind and our physically handicapped to exist on an average payment

01:25.520 --> 01:32.240
of less than $58 a month in order to correct this shameful neglect I have proposed in the

01:32.240 --> 01:38.040
United States Senate that the government assume greater responsibility and public assistance

01:38.040 --> 01:45.040
payments to the state so that we can give our American needy at least $100 a month.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.040
Thank you.

01:55.520 --> 02:18.000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just keep, Father.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.200
How can we pride ourselves on having the highest standard of living in the world when we condemn

02:24.200 --> 02:30.720
our needy agent, our blind and our physically handicapped to exist on an average payment

02:30.720 --> 02:37.440
of less than $58 a month in order to correct this shameful neglect I have proposed in the

02:37.440 --> 02:43.280
United States Senate that the government assume greater responsibility and public assistance

02:43.280 --> 02:49.720
payments to the state so that we can give our American needy at least $100 a month.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.400
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just keep, Father.

03:24.400 --> 03:31.600
How can we pride ourselves on having the highest standard of living in the world when we condemn

03:31.600 --> 03:38.200
our needy agent, our blind and our physically handicapped to exist on an average payment of

03:38.200 --> 03:44.800
less than $58 a month in order to correct this shameful neglect I have proposed in the

03:44.800 --> 03:50.640
United States Senate that the government assume greater responsibility and public assistance

03:50.640 --> 03:57.320
payments to the state so that we can give our American needy at least $100 a month.

04:14.800 --> 04:21.480
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just keep, Father.

04:44.800 --> 04:57.920
Ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago I was made chairman of the Senate, a Judiciary Committee

04:57.920 --> 05:04.000
subcommittee on problems of juvenile delinquency. There's a problem of an increasing number of young

05:04.000 --> 05:11.560
people coming in conflict with law officers committing crimes is causing a great deal of trouble

05:11.560 --> 05:18.760
and concern all around the nation. We know too that this is a largely a local problem having to do

05:18.760 --> 05:24.120
with the parents in the home, the kind of guidance they give our young people, the influence in the

05:24.120 --> 05:31.960
church and in our schools. But also it is a matter in which we ought to be concerned about at all

05:31.960 --> 05:37.000
levels of government. That is wherever the federal government or the state or the county can do

05:37.000 --> 05:43.720
anything to help in curbing juvenile delinquency that we want to do. We are the Senate Committee hope

05:43.720 --> 05:51.160
to offer some kind of leadership, focus attention on this problem first to find out what the extent of

05:51.160 --> 05:57.480
it is and what we can do at the federal level to help. In the federal government we do have charge

05:57.480 --> 06:04.120
of the enforcement of the narcotics law and we hope to increase and to better that enforcement so that

06:04.120 --> 06:09.800
the narcotic peddlers were not imposed upon and make victims of so many of our young people.

06:10.840 --> 06:17.720
Then of course a literature in mail crosses state lines so that we have some jurisdiction

06:18.280 --> 06:23.800
as to the mails and as to things that are sold in interstate commerce. One of our hearings has

06:23.800 --> 06:31.320
had to do with comic books, horror and crime comic books. We have held hearings, we had a hearing in

06:31.320 --> 06:39.640
New York some time back in which we found that there are 30 million or rather 100 million comic

06:39.640 --> 06:46.840
books sold each month to be read by our children. All that 100 million, about 25 million we found are the

06:46.840 --> 06:54.840
so-called horror or crime type. I have here on the board some of these kind you'll see that here's

06:54.840 --> 07:02.840
a man about to be shot the picked in a sudden death. Here's another person in his coffin with a

07:02.840 --> 07:08.520
spike being driven through him. Here's a woman who is apparently being executed in some weird way.

07:09.720 --> 07:18.520
All of them show violent death or punishment. Here's a skeleton about to pull a man into his coffin.

07:19.480 --> 07:27.080
Here's a man who is being one who is being crushed to death and I have some others here a person

07:27.080 --> 07:35.080
about to be killed by some kind of animal and here's a woman about to commit some kind of murder

07:35.080 --> 07:43.320
of violent fliction. They also show disrespect for poor police. Well all of the testimony shows that

07:43.320 --> 07:51.400
this kind of business upsets the nervous system of a normal child, let alone one who might be

07:51.400 --> 07:57.400
not so stable. Well we complained about this a great deal and I'm happy to say that all over the

07:57.400 --> 08:03.640
country today that local people are demanding that this ought to fill the limited from the news stand.

08:04.600 --> 08:11.480
We found that the distributors of these horror and crime comics had tie-in sales with their

08:12.200 --> 08:16.760
with their news dealers. That is they had to take a certain amount of this in order to get the

08:16.760 --> 08:23.880
better magazines. We have tried to break that up. We have forced the comic book industry to appoint

08:23.880 --> 08:31.240
a czar, a Mr. Murphy who goes over all of these comics. Of course a lot of them are good ones. They're

08:31.240 --> 08:37.560
not all of this type and they are doing something to clean up their own house. We hope that you people

08:37.560 --> 08:44.360
will see to it that these tie-in sales do not continue, that this kind of filth which undoubtedly

08:44.360 --> 08:50.520
has contributed to juvenile delinquency is not offered for our children to read. We have gotten

08:50.520 --> 08:56.200
out a report which has been filed in the Senate on our findings about comic books. We will be very

08:56.200 --> 09:03.000
happy to send anyone who may write a copy of this very interesting report. We find also that the

09:03.080 --> 09:13.080
advertisements in these horror and crime comics are things for young people who commit fences with

09:13.080 --> 09:19.400
and also that when they answer these advertisements very frequently they get back suggestions that

09:19.400 --> 09:26.120
they order pornographic or filthy literature that but you're all familiar and that is also a very

09:26.120 --> 09:31.480
big business in the nation today. So to the extent that we cannot at the federal level try to

09:32.360 --> 09:38.440
avoid or prevent our young people from being influenced by this kind of literature,

09:39.160 --> 09:45.560
the extent that we can close the operation of interstate commerce to influences which are

09:45.560 --> 09:51.720
deleterious to young people and whatever we can do at the federal level our juvenile delinquency

09:51.720 --> 09:57.240
subcommittee expects to recommend to the Senate and I think we will accomplish much. But after all

09:57.240 --> 10:02.040
if a local problem and requires local cooperation thank you.

10:09.960 --> 10:16.680
Our American way of living promotes incentive for every individual. The person who works harder

10:16.680 --> 10:24.120
or does a better job receives extra benefit. Those who produce more get more and this we believe

10:24.120 --> 10:31.800
is a just reward. There is the danger however of any of us establishing a distorted sense of value.

10:32.680 --> 10:39.960
We sometimes become so in growth in gaining material benefits that we forget such important

10:39.960 --> 10:47.320
items as religion, culture, family and even our own physical well-being and even if we do not forget

10:47.320 --> 10:53.960
them we neglect. One of the questions we must face is whether or not we have in the last two

10:53.960 --> 11:03.960
decades gained a new leisure time only to spend it somewhat unwiz. Recreation is God's great

11:03.960 --> 11:12.440
out of doors prescription. It is a prescription for you and me and one which doctors often prescribe

11:12.440 --> 11:19.640
not only for us but for themselves. The value of a day and Tennessee's magnificent outdoors

11:20.120 --> 11:27.320
or on one of our fine lakes and streams is something that cannot be overestimated.

11:27.320 --> 11:32.840
It is conservatively estimated that some 25% of all Tennessee's,

11:32.840 --> 11:42.120
hunt or fish or do boat, perhaps a greater percentage than participate in any other form of recreation.

11:42.120 --> 11:48.760
The recreations of hunting and fishing are of course depended upon the wildlife resources of our state.

11:48.920 --> 11:55.400
The many forms of wildlife in turn are dependent upon conservation practices being applied to our

11:55.400 --> 12:03.320
soils, our waters and our forests. Thus in order to call attention to the need for continued

12:03.320 --> 12:11.480
application of proper soil forestry water and wildlife conservation practices this proclamation

12:11.480 --> 12:19.240
has been prepared. Whereas hunting, fishing and trapping play important roles in the initial

12:19.240 --> 12:27.240
exploration and subsequent development of Tennessee. And whereas the wildlife resources upon which

12:27.240 --> 12:33.080
these wholesome and healthful recreations are dependent continue to be of great aesthetic and

12:33.080 --> 12:39.560
economic value to young and old Tennisians alive. In whereas citizens of this age,

12:39.560 --> 12:46.440
bear an obligation to future generations to perpetuate the multitudinous values of the aforementioned

12:46.440 --> 12:52.840
wildlife resources. Now therefore, I Frank G. Clemmet, governor of the state of Tennessee,

12:52.840 --> 13:01.720
do hereby proclaim and to set aside the week of March 20 through March 26, 1955 to be observed

13:01.720 --> 13:08.920
throughout the sovereign state as wildlife restoration week. And witness where I have here

13:08.920 --> 13:16.200
unto set my hand and calls to be a fix the great seal of the state of Tennessee and the capital

13:16.200 --> 13:21.240
and the city of Nashville this first day of March 1955.

13:22.680 --> 13:28.120
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope this will mean more than words to us and the Tennessee will

13:28.120 --> 13:35.640
join with others of these great United States in observing National Wildlife Week. This week coinciding

13:35.640 --> 13:42.200
with the arrival of spring is dedicated to the conservation of America's wildlife resources,

13:42.200 --> 13:49.720
our natural resources, our soils, waters, forest minerals and wildlife and general. The theme of this

13:49.720 --> 13:57.960
year's National Wildlife Week observance is save America's wetlands. Some might say why

13:57.960 --> 14:04.920
is the theme save America's wetlands? Well, with the destruction of over 75 percent of our wetlands

14:04.920 --> 14:10.520
through drainage, pollution and thoughtless misuse, we've caused the depletion of many of our

14:10.520 --> 14:18.360
most valuable forms of wildlife, ducks, geese, songbirds, fur bearers and fish. State and federal

14:18.360 --> 14:25.000
conservation agencies are initiating programs for the preservation of remaining wetlands. The

14:25.000 --> 14:31.720
health band support of every Tennessee and its require if these resources are to be saved. Let's

14:31.720 --> 14:38.680
do a little work, have a little fun and make not only our pleasure but the pleasure of our children

14:38.680 --> 14:43.720
and our children's children and the great outdoor life of greater and more secure.

16:19.320 --> 16:34.600
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Estes' key fover candidate for re-election to a second term in the

16:34.600 --> 16:41.320
United States Senate speaking to you on this occasion. On this occasion I want to talk with you about

16:41.320 --> 16:47.640
the importance of agriculture and the position that I have taken during the 15 and a half years that

16:47.640 --> 16:53.720
I have been either in the Congress or in the United States Senate in connection with our agricultural

16:53.720 --> 17:00.680
problems. I feel that the farmers are the backbone of this nation. We cannot have prosperity either

17:00.680 --> 17:07.560
for our industry or for our working people unless the farmers do well. So I have always thought to work

17:07.560 --> 17:14.360
far and sponsor and secure the passage of programs that would give the farmer an even break with

17:14.360 --> 17:20.920
labor and with industry. I think that all of these great segments of our economy must do well

17:20.920 --> 17:26.600
if the nation is going to go forward and prosper. If the farmer doesn't do well the other two cannot

17:27.800 --> 17:33.960
industry cannot have things cannot manufacture things and people are out of work in the various

17:33.960 --> 17:39.720
plants of this nation. We have in the nation today some protection for industry and the way of

17:39.720 --> 17:46.600
protective tariffs and other protections and that's all right up to a point and we have a

17:46.600 --> 17:53.080
floor under wages and then salaries and wages are fixed back, collective bargaining and I believe in

17:53.080 --> 17:57.880
collective bargaining and I believe in good wages for our working people. But you simply cannot

17:57.880 --> 18:04.040
protect two segments of our economy and throw the farmer to the four wins. The farmer is entitled to

18:04.120 --> 18:11.640
be treated on a parity or an inequality with industry and with labor so that I have always thought to

18:11.640 --> 18:18.360
try to see that the farmer got prices for his products which would give him an equivalent

18:18.360 --> 18:24.760
purchasing power and place in our economy with these other two sections. I have always thought for

18:24.760 --> 18:31.000
90% of parity as a support price for farmers products. I know it may not be the ultimate answer

18:31.480 --> 18:37.080
but until some other method of is arrived at which will keep farmers prices up and will not

18:38.120 --> 18:44.360
discriminate against the farmer I'm going to continue to support 90% of parity. As a matter of

18:44.360 --> 18:48.920
fact I have a bill pending in the Senate now which I expect to offer when the agricultural

18:48.920 --> 18:55.000
program comes up soon in the United States Senate which will continue this program on for another

18:55.000 --> 19:00.520
two years. I'm certain that one of the reasons why we are having unemployment in the nation today

19:01.400 --> 19:08.760
and why there is somewhat of a recession is the fact that farmers prices have been going down and

19:08.760 --> 19:17.480
down more than 23 or 4% whereas everything the farmer has to buy has been staying up high or even

19:17.480 --> 19:27.400
going higher. During the month of May and June for instance parity fell from 92 to 88% whereas the

19:27.400 --> 19:33.960
price of steel has gone up for about $3. Well that just isn't fair to the farmer it's not a good

19:33.960 --> 19:40.040
thing for the nation and I think we ought to try to do something about it. In the Senate sometime

19:40.040 --> 19:45.080
back I have co-sponsored the so-called fire amendment to try to give some protection to our dairy

19:45.080 --> 19:51.960
farmers. This fire amendment provided that 90% support price on dairy products could not be lowered

19:52.520 --> 19:57.640
unless there was a corresponding decrease in lowering of the things that dairy farmers had to buy.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.680
We were not successful in getting the amendment by but we tried and we will try again.

20:03.640 --> 20:08.120
I know that we do have a substantial surplus in the nation but if we would get more of it in our

20:08.120 --> 20:14.360
school lunch program if we would open up the gates of world trade and sell things abroad and take

20:14.360 --> 20:20.360
things back from other nations that we need we wouldn't have any farm surplus. That would be a

20:20.360 --> 20:26.520
good thing for our agriculture for our industry and in the interest of peace too and I hope that we

20:26.520 --> 20:33.720
can get such a reciprocal trade program through on a long and permanent basis. Thank you very much.

20:51.320 --> 20:57.400
Good evening ladies and gentlemen WMCT the commercial appeal television station presents at this

20:57.400 --> 21:03.240
time as a public service a special feature with Senator Esther's keeper of Tennessee who is in

21:03.240 --> 21:09.560
Memphis for the express purpose of reporting on what happened in this session of Congress 1949.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.480
I'd like to present to you now ladies and gentlemen Senator Esther's keeper.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.000
Senator it's a pleasure to have you back here in Memphis with us once again.

21:17.080 --> 21:22.840
Thank you very much Charlie Sullivan. I'm very happy to be in Memphis after having been in the Senate

21:22.840 --> 21:27.640
for about a year now. Well Senator that brings to mind exactly what we would like to talk about

21:27.640 --> 21:32.200
and here a report from you tonight. The folks want to hear what you have to say and not what I have to

21:32.200 --> 21:37.240
say so can you tell us something that went on in Congress this year? I know a lot went on but we'd

21:37.240 --> 21:43.000
like to take up a few bits of legislation that you were active in. Well Charlie I want to say first

21:43.000 --> 21:48.120
that I think you have my the purpose of my visit a little bit wrong I not only want to try to

21:48.120 --> 21:53.320
report on some of the things that have taken place in Congress but it's my purpose to get around

21:53.320 --> 21:59.240
Tennessee and see what the people think about their federal government give them a chance to tell

21:59.240 --> 22:05.400
me where I made a lot of mistakes and I certainly have made a lot of them. So it's a mutual affair to

22:06.360 --> 22:10.600
have the people tell me what to do and also I try to tell them what I've tried to do in the

22:10.600 --> 22:15.240
reasons. Well Senator I can understand why you were elected with that view boy. Well I it's very

22:15.240 --> 22:20.280
hard to me to understand how I got elected but I do have a lot of good friends here at Charlie. You

22:20.280 --> 22:26.920
ask about some legislation of course here in this part of the of Tennessee we have many things

22:26.920 --> 22:31.960
that we are interested in. I think with the particularly with the leadership of Senator McEller on

22:31.960 --> 22:36.840
the appropriations committee we were able to get enough money to go ahead with the Memphis Harbor

22:36.840 --> 22:42.280
Project which is a great thing and has the full sanction of the Corps of Engineers and of the

22:42.280 --> 22:49.560
United States Congress. Also we got an appropriation for flood control activities in this area.

22:50.440 --> 22:55.320
One of the big fights we had Charlie was over the TVA early in this session of Congress when we

22:56.040 --> 23:02.040
wanted to go on with our industrial expansion and have the New Johnsonville steam plant up on the

23:02.040 --> 23:09.720
Tennessee River. We had quite a fight in Congress the private tower trust was out to wreck the TVA

23:09.720 --> 23:16.200
but we won that fight all right. So the TVA is going ahead and as a result of that we have

23:16.840 --> 23:22.760
are going to have a large expansion of the activities at Oak Ridge and we hope to get the air

23:22.760 --> 23:27.640
engineering development center which is going to be this great wind tunnel that you heard so much

23:27.640 --> 23:32.920
about. Somewhere in Tennessee and wherever it's located will of course suit me fine.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.720
I don't know what else particularly you were interested in Charlie I might say that we

23:39.240 --> 23:44.360
were able to secure the passage of a very good cotton control act so that we are going to have a

23:44.360 --> 23:50.280
sound cotton market and economy in the years to come. Well Senator that's one thing that I think

23:50.280 --> 23:55.240
a lot of people are interested in in our television audience what went on for the farmer and you

23:55.240 --> 24:00.200
have mentioned about the cotton can you tell us anything else. Yes this session of Congress passed a

24:00.200 --> 24:09.160
long range permanent farm law it provides for a price support of 90% of parity for one year on certain

24:09.160 --> 24:16.680
basic commodities then it may be lowered on a flexible basis to 80% next year then thereafter it's

24:16.680 --> 24:25.000
on a 75 to 90% of parity a flexible basis but one thing about it the parity figure has been

24:25.000 --> 24:31.560
increased always to include the cost of the farmers own labor then of interest to people in rural areas

24:31.560 --> 24:36.520
we passed a rural electric telephone bill so that they're going to be able to long-last get

24:36.520 --> 24:41.960
service. Oh I see. Life will certainly be welcomed by the farmer I'm sure. Well I don't know if you

24:42.040 --> 24:46.600
ever lived way out in the country where it's hard to get to a telephone but there's been a great

24:46.600 --> 24:55.240
demand for rural telephones and then this Congress passed a splendid overall housing bill the fight

24:55.240 --> 25:02.280
for that bill was led by Senator Sparkman of Alabama it provides a housing accommodations

25:02.280 --> 25:09.240
adequately I think for every income segment of our population they are a number there is an

25:09.240 --> 25:15.880
authorization for a limited number of public housing units then there's a slump clearance

25:15.880 --> 25:21.960
project and for the first time some assistance has been given to rural housing and I think that is

25:21.960 --> 25:27.080
greatly in the public interest the South is spared very well in this the first session of the 81st

25:27.080 --> 25:32.520
Congress. Those are heartening words Senator Kifalvar now in the time that we have left Kajou just

25:32.520 --> 25:37.080
quickly tell us what we may expect when the next session of Congress convenes January 3rd.

25:37.720 --> 25:41.320
Well we hope to complete action on federal aid for education to secure

25:42.280 --> 25:48.280
expansion of social security benefits there are many items of our foreign policy that need

25:48.280 --> 25:53.480
attention and we also want to adopt some more parts of the Hoover report to cut down governmental

25:53.480 --> 26:00.200
expenses. Thank you very much Senator Estes Kifalvar for being with us tonight and giving us

26:00.200 --> 26:05.640
this special exclusive television report from Congress. Senator Estes Kifalvar will be at the

26:05.640 --> 26:07.160
P body at 8 o'clock tonight.

26:20.360 --> 26:26.920
Ladies and gentlemen this is Estes Kifalvar candidate for the United States Senate asking for

26:26.920 --> 26:33.080
a second term in that body speaking to you on this occasion. Today I want to talk with you about

26:33.160 --> 26:40.520
some of the issues in the present senatorial campaign. I'm not going to indulge in a lot of

26:40.520 --> 26:46.920
recrimination and bickering back and forth. On my wall in the my Senate office in the Senate

26:46.920 --> 26:53.800
office building in Washington I have framed a very important saying of Abraham Lincoln and which

26:53.800 --> 26:59.400
he says that if I spend all of my time answering my bitter critics I wouldn't have time for public

26:59.480 --> 27:04.680
business and that's the way I feel about it. Any event it wouldn't be in a use trying to

27:06.360 --> 27:13.000
go into all of the charges and misrepresentations and innuendo that's being put around by one of

27:13.000 --> 27:19.800
my opponent, because he apparently changes his position from place to place and what he says in

27:19.800 --> 27:25.480
Tennessee does not always coincide with just what his record is in the Congress of the United

27:25.640 --> 27:31.640
States. Just as one example, now at Memphis Tennessee on the talkathon and I have the exact

27:32.120 --> 27:37.720
transcript here. One of my opponents when asked whether he was for universal military training said

27:37.720 --> 27:43.640
quote, I'm not for universal military training, I'm bitterly opposed to it and I'm conscientiously

27:43.640 --> 27:50.440
opposed to it. Then when asked if he didn't vote for it in 1951 he answered quote, I definitely

27:50.520 --> 27:55.640
did not. Well here happens to be the, that's what he said in Memphis Tennessee on the talkathon.

27:56.280 --> 28:00.440
Here happens to be the voting record on universal military training and service.

28:01.160 --> 28:07.640
S1, here's the motion to recommit, he voted against the motion to recommit, here's the vote for

28:07.640 --> 28:13.400
final passage of universal military training which he voted for, here's the conference report

28:13.400 --> 28:17.880
after differences have been worked out with the House of Representatives which he voted for,

28:18.440 --> 28:23.960
three very distinct votes so that I don't think there'd be any use with one who shifts his position

28:23.960 --> 28:29.800
from time to time and trying to follow the various and sundry shifts. So I want to talk about what

28:29.800 --> 28:35.880
I've tried to do and what I plan to do in the future. Friends as you know I was elected to the House

28:35.880 --> 28:42.440
of Representatives back in 1939 and then six years ago you elected me to the United States Senate.

28:43.320 --> 28:50.120
Since I have been there I have cast a vote on thousands and thousands of controversial issues.

28:51.240 --> 28:55.560
It wouldn't be possible to review all of that voting record with you on this occasion but I want

28:55.560 --> 29:01.640
to tell you the general philosophy behind all of the votes that I have cast. That is that the

29:01.640 --> 29:07.080
greatness and the main thing in this country is not our material things however important they may be

29:07.720 --> 29:15.320
but our good hardworking religious people and I've always tried to sponsor and promote and aid

29:15.320 --> 29:19.960
causes which would give the average man and woman of this nation a better opportunity

29:19.960 --> 29:25.640
to participate in government to make a better living and to educate his children and on that

29:25.640 --> 29:32.360
basis I've always felt that there should be a balance and an equality between labor, agriculture

29:32.520 --> 29:38.520
and industry. I think each has its right plight rightful place and each is entitled to be protected

29:38.520 --> 29:42.360
and I want to see each do well. I think each must do well if we're going to have a

29:43.000 --> 29:50.040
forward looking and a prosperous America. I've always tried to work to see that the working man

29:50.040 --> 29:56.200
got good wages. I don't believe in 50 cent a day wage. I want our working people to have good

29:56.200 --> 30:01.720
working conditions and I have opposed any laws that I thought were intended just to penalize or

30:01.720 --> 30:07.880
strike down the working man or some organization that he might belong to. And I believe sincerely

30:07.880 --> 30:13.880
in our free enterprise system in this nation. I believe it means a competitive enterprise system.

30:14.440 --> 30:19.240
I think in order to have a healthy economy we ought to have thousands and thousands of small

30:19.240 --> 30:24.200
industries, small business people. I never want us to live in a nation where somebody can turn

30:24.200 --> 30:30.280
a switch up in New York and everybody else in the nation has to dance or will be thrown out of jobs

30:30.280 --> 30:36.760
and employment or something of that kind. I've always supported the fair trade practice laws so

30:36.760 --> 30:42.520
that our businessmen would not be met with unfair competition. I have supported these strengthening

30:42.520 --> 30:47.800
and the maintenance of the Robinson Patman Act for the protection of our business people and

30:47.800 --> 30:53.080
particularly our merchants. I've been successful in getting an amendment to the plateen act so as to

30:53.080 --> 30:59.960
prevent big corporations from swallowing up and merging with and bringing in little corporations and thereby

30:59.960 --> 31:05.400
creating monopolies and eliminating competition. I want this to always be a nation where any

31:06.040 --> 31:10.840
boy or girl in the state of Tennessee can go into business and go as far up the letter of success

31:10.840 --> 31:16.280
as he's capable of going. I've always felt that the farmer is the backbone of this great nation of

31:16.280 --> 31:22.920
ours and I've always supported a farmer in his efforts to have an even break in our economy.

31:23.560 --> 31:28.520
I believe that we must have a successful agriculture if we're going to have a successful America.

31:29.160 --> 31:34.520
I know that if you take one dollar out of the prices of the farmer that that automatically

31:34.520 --> 31:40.680
takes seven dollars away from any business community. I've supported the soil conservation service,

31:40.680 --> 31:47.160
the extension service, all of the great aids for the welfare of the farmer and I know that 90%

31:47.160 --> 31:52.520
of parity may not be the ultimate answer but I've always worked for it and I now have a bill pending

31:52.520 --> 31:58.120
to continue it on for another two years. I'm not going to sit by our with farm prices going

31:58.200 --> 32:05.560
down and down and be far sliding scale where the farmer always comes out at the bottom when almost

32:05.560 --> 32:11.640
everything the farmer has to buy stays up on a high level or is doing higher and higher. I will

32:11.640 --> 32:16.120
always fight for the welfare of the farmer, I always have and I will continue to do so.

32:17.400 --> 32:23.960
Then I know that we have a lot of farm surfaces in this nation but I think that we would open up

32:23.960 --> 32:29.400
the gates of world trade. After all half of the people in this world are hungry for food, many of

32:29.400 --> 32:35.240
them are starving. They have things in their nation that we need like chrome, manganese, oil and rubber.

32:35.960 --> 32:41.400
We can send them our food stuff and bring back the things that they have that we need in this country

32:41.400 --> 32:46.680
as was envisioned by the former secretary of state Cardell Hull. We ought to have a real

32:46.680 --> 32:53.400
expansion of world trade not only for our own good but in interest of peace in the world and I've

32:53.400 --> 32:59.320
always worked hard for Mr. Cardell Hull's reciprocal trade agreement program. I think it is a vital

32:59.320 --> 33:04.280
interest to the people of this nation. Then too I think we could do more with our surfaces if we

33:04.840 --> 33:10.280
increased our school lunch program and if we had full employment like I fought for in the full

33:10.280 --> 33:15.800
employment act of 1946 and if people had all they needed to eat we wouldn't have any surfaces

33:15.800 --> 33:21.480
in this country. I've always fought hard even before I got into public life for the Tennessee

33:21.480 --> 33:27.320
Valley Authority. This great agency which has given us an opportunity for the first time in the

33:27.320 --> 33:33.640
history of our section. It has improved our agriculture, our industries, given us great recreational

33:33.640 --> 33:40.680
opportunities built up our standard of living. It is a tremendous national asset and I want it

33:40.680 --> 33:45.640
continued for the welfare of the people of this section and of the nation. We know it's

33:45.640 --> 33:50.840
imparral today. This idea of the private power people building a steam planted west Memphis

33:50.840 --> 33:56.760
Arkansas is just for the purpose of making the TVA dependent upon private power sources at high

33:56.760 --> 34:02.440
rates for its power. I fought hard against it in the United States Senate. I hope that somewhere along

34:02.440 --> 34:07.160
the land we can stop this chipping away and sabotaging of the Tennessee Valley Authority.

34:07.800 --> 34:13.560
I know that we are gaining strength in the nation. I know that justice is on our side and I'm going

34:13.560 --> 34:19.400
to join my colleague Senator Gover and others in fighting as hard as we can for the preservation

34:19.400 --> 34:26.520
of the TVA and in the end we're going to win too. I've always worked for the R.E.A. because I think

34:26.520 --> 34:32.680
the electric lines and electricity for the farmer is one of the finest things that can come to the

34:32.680 --> 34:39.000
farmer. It's being imparral too but we're going to win our fight for the R.E.A. We always have in the

34:39.000 --> 34:45.240
Congress. I have always given special attention to legislation for the welfare of the veterans of

34:45.240 --> 34:51.480
this nation. I co-sponsored the GI Bill of Rights. I worked for the Veterans Rehabilitation

34:51.480 --> 34:57.960
Educational Program. Right now I've joined in a bill to for an increase in compensation by 10%

34:57.960 --> 35:04.760
to our veterans. I've seen to it that they got acreage allotment and on my own I sponsored a bill

35:04.760 --> 35:09.400
for a little RFC for veterans to give them a chance to have capital so that they could go into

35:09.400 --> 35:14.920
business on their own. I'm on the Armed Services Committee on the Senate and as long as I'm there

35:14.920 --> 35:20.120
I'm going to try to see that this government is grateful to these men who offer their services

35:20.120 --> 35:25.320
for the welfare of their country. I have supported all of the great pieces of legislation recommended

35:25.320 --> 35:31.480
by the National Legislative Committee of the American Legion and the VFW which have been passed

35:31.480 --> 35:37.080
in the past 15 and a half years in the Congress. And I believe very sincerely in our social

35:37.080 --> 35:43.080
security system. I want to see it expanded so as to bring in other people. And I've fought hard

35:43.080 --> 35:48.760
and have filed many bills to increase the amount the federal government puts out for the old age

35:48.760 --> 35:54.280
assistance program. We have accomplished much but I'm not going to resist in my effort until I

35:54.280 --> 35:59.720
deserve an agent get just as much and are treated just as well as they are anywhere else in the

35:59.720 --> 36:04.920
United States. They are entitled to that and I'm going to fight for these deserving old people.

36:05.800 --> 36:11.000
Then too I've always tried to protect the people of our state from being imposed upon by a

36:11.000 --> 36:16.440
monopolies and by cartels. I fought to keep the gas rates down when they tried to take away the

36:16.440 --> 36:22.680
power of the federal power commission to regulate them. I fought the grab of the Tadlin's oil with

36:22.680 --> 36:27.880
up to $300 billion when the Supreme Court said it belonged to the people of all of the states

36:27.880 --> 36:32.600
and they tried to take it and did succeed in giving it just to the people of three coastal states.

36:33.320 --> 36:39.000
I want to just set aside as a great grant in aid to the states for education and Tennessee's

36:39.000 --> 36:44.680
park would have meant more than $200 million in the near future. Our school teachers are underpaid.

36:44.680 --> 36:49.800
We need new buildings. What this great Tadlin's oil money would have meant to the state of Tennessee.

36:50.440 --> 36:55.240
And I've joined Senator Cooper and Senator McFlellan in sponsoring a school building construction

36:56.200 --> 37:00.520
program. I want our children in Tennessee to have justice good and educational opportunity

37:00.520 --> 37:06.200
as they have anywhere else in all of the United States. And friends I've spent a great deal of time

37:06.200 --> 37:10.600
in the United States Senate as chairman of the Senate Crime Investigating Committee.

37:11.320 --> 37:15.160
We expose the hoodlums of this nation. The gangs were broken up.

37:15.800 --> 37:20.760
There are many federal statutes including one for mandatory sentence for dope peddlers

37:20.840 --> 37:26.600
prohibiting the interstate shipment of gambling devices. Making it easier to deport alien

37:26.600 --> 37:33.640
criminals who have come into this country. Also we have put the nationwide mob wire service out

37:33.640 --> 37:40.360
of a commission. This was the thing that held all of the gangsters together. It was owned by Mr.

37:40.360 --> 37:46.600
McBride who was associated with a Mr. Venn down in Miami, Florida and Mr. Venn has of course been

37:46.600 --> 37:51.320
in Tennessee as they paid publicist running talkethons for one of my opponents.

37:52.280 --> 37:56.760
Ask any of the people in any of the large cities where our committee held hundreds and hundreds

37:56.760 --> 38:01.800
of hearings. They will tell you that the gangs were broken up and that America today is a

38:01.800 --> 38:06.920
cleaner nation than it was before. I don't want the support of these criminals were there,

38:07.640 --> 38:13.400
were there political allies. I don't think that America can be a healthy place when we have

38:13.400 --> 38:19.000
their influence and if we're going to be the example of democracy I think that we must

38:20.120 --> 38:24.600
get out the criminal element wherever we find them either in business or in politics.

38:25.320 --> 38:30.120
Now I want to say a word about this great issue of war or peace. I've always voted to keep

38:30.120 --> 38:36.360
America strong militarily during this time of peril and I voted to keep up the air force when

38:36.360 --> 38:41.480
others are voting to cut it down. But I think also that in addition to military might that the

38:41.480 --> 38:47.800
United States must lead a moral and educational and economic crusade in the interest of peace.

38:48.520 --> 38:53.320
I've supported the United Nations because after all it is the only organization that we have

38:53.320 --> 38:59.320
through which we can work for peace. I'm not in favor of recognizing red China and red China can't

38:59.320 --> 39:04.440
get into the United Nations and I'm not in favor of building up a hypothetical case just to let

39:04.440 --> 39:09.800
the isolation strike down the United Nations. I've supported trying to hold together the free

39:09.880 --> 39:15.880
people of the world as was envisioned by NATO. I've supported Mr. Hull's reciprocal trade agreement

39:15.880 --> 39:22.120
program. I want us to make such a good example of democracy in the United States so that the hundreds

39:22.120 --> 39:27.320
of millions of people in other parts of the world and behind the Iron Curtain will join us and not

39:27.320 --> 39:33.000
the communists and trying to have a more peaceful and a better world. And ladies and gentlemen,

39:33.640 --> 39:39.480
the next war of its come is going to be too horrible and too devastating to even consider.

39:39.480 --> 39:45.160
We must do all that we can to prevent it. All that we can do with honor. If it must come,

39:45.160 --> 39:50.680
if that kind of devastation must come to mankind, let it at least be said that the people of the United

39:50.680 --> 39:56.600
States did their utmost to prevent it. I hope that I can work for you for another six years during

39:56.600 --> 40:03.160
a second term. I have tried hard during this past. I went with more experience. I hope that I will be

40:03.160 --> 40:08.920
able to do more for the people of Tennessee during another six years in the United States Senate.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.960
I will appreciate your support very, very much.

40:11.960 --> 40:20.440
I will say later.

40:34.280 --> 40:38.600
Climaxing ten months of nationwide hearings, the Senate Crime Investigating Committee,

40:38.600 --> 40:43.960
headed by Senator Kefaw ver left, opens hearings in New York. It's goal to uncover links between

40:43.960 --> 40:49.720
the underworld and city officials. First witness is Frank Erickson, currently in jail for bookmaking,

40:49.720 --> 40:55.000
under another indictment for gambling and facing a... Erickson, we have paid any legitimate

40:55.000 --> 41:01.640
occupation which you ever are tech-a-pated. I refuse to answer on a grounds of my intended commitment.

41:02.600 --> 41:07.880
The two million dollar income tax, Lane Erickson proves uncooperative. Senator Kefaw ver

41:07.880 --> 41:11.640
warns. Don't want that. You don't call the Williamster. Erickson, but we...

41:12.920 --> 41:14.920
I want to show all to respect to the Southers.

41:14.920 --> 41:18.040
We'll have to deal with some questions that you're going to have to ask.

41:18.040 --> 41:18.920
What did the abetion?

41:26.200 --> 41:27.640
We can't pay you, Mr. Erickson.

41:28.440 --> 41:32.440
My business, I'm going to visit some in jail.

41:32.440 --> 41:39.000
Eddie votes to cite Erickson for contempt. A punishment the next witness, Joe Adonis escapes,

41:39.000 --> 41:44.520
only because the committee had cited him previously. Adonis called by the committee the number two

41:44.520 --> 41:49.880
man in a vast crime syndicate linking New York. Miami and New Orleans admits nothing.

41:49.880 --> 41:54.840
Next day Frank Costello, whom the committee calls the crime syndicate's boss, appears. His

41:54.840 --> 41:59.400
memories as bad as his predecessors on the stand. Asked by committee counsel Holly how much cash

41:59.400 --> 42:06.520
he kept in a box at home, he answers. Well, I wouldn't know exactly, but I might have 40 of

42:06.520 --> 42:12.520
stress deeds, 75,000 in there I wouldn't know. In other words, is the committee to understand

42:13.240 --> 42:20.360
that to the best of your knowledge, the amount of cash that you have in the box is approximately

42:20.600 --> 42:27.560
40 or 50,000 dollars. Later Virginia Hill House, a friend of slain gangsta bugsie seagull and other

42:27.560 --> 42:34.200
raccotiers, is asked how she rose from rags to riches. Well, I worked a while then. The men I was

42:34.200 --> 42:39.960
around that gave me things were not gangsters or raccoteers or whatever you call these other people.

42:40.680 --> 42:45.320
The only time I ever got anything from them was going out and having fun and maybe a few presents.

42:46.120 --> 42:52.600
Like a lot of girls that they've given me things and bought me everything I want and when I was

42:52.600 --> 42:59.640
with Ben, he paid for everything. By Ben you mean Ben Seagull. Yes. And he gave me some money too and

43:01.240 --> 43:07.720
bought me a house in Florida. Committee counsel Holly asked Mrs. House, how well she knew Frank Costello.

43:08.360 --> 43:15.640
And did you have a occasion to meet Costello on other occasions? No only when I used to see him in

43:15.640 --> 43:21.160
restaurants or someplace. And you did say him from time to time in restaurants? A few times.

43:22.520 --> 43:30.600
Did you ever get any money from Costello? No. Admitting she won 20,000 a year on horses, Mrs. House

43:30.600 --> 43:37.800
asked. Do you still vet the horse race? I see only thing now. I don't bet anything. Now I'm

43:37.800 --> 43:46.280
afraid I'll win and then they'll say I made more money than I did. The committee calls Costello

43:46.280 --> 43:51.560
for a third day, rejecting his lawyer's plea for postponement because of his condition. All right.

43:51.640 --> 44:01.000
I have a low condition, you heard my statement through Mr. World and I stand by it and the

44:01.000 --> 44:10.520
low condition will I testify until I'm well enough. You refuse to testify, Father? Absolutely.

44:11.560 --> 44:16.040
Mr. Hally, all due respect to the sound which I have to look at. Nor for a lot of respect for him.

44:16.680 --> 44:21.880
I'm not going to answer another question. You just because I'm not under arrest and I'm going to walk out.

44:24.520 --> 44:30.600
Defying the threat by Chairman Kieferber of Senator Rest and a contempt citation, Costello does walk out.

44:37.400 --> 44:41.960
Senate crime robbers call former mayor of New York Ambassador William O'Duire. Chief

44:41.960 --> 44:46.760
counsel Hally asks what O'Duire learned about crime bosses from the mysteriously dead murder

44:46.760 --> 44:53.240
witness Abe Raleigh. In the entire set up as an overall proposition Adana Frank as one of the big

44:54.760 --> 44:59.640
fourth one of what you might call the board of directors. All right. Raleigh said so.

45:00.760 --> 45:05.160
And I think he actually named a six man whom he thought was a top man. Is that right?

45:05.320 --> 45:14.360
I'm not too sure of that. I'm not too sure of the names. I doubt if Raleigh's new the names.

45:14.920 --> 45:18.920
He knew them wrong here in this neighborhood, but I doubt if he knew them all over the country.

45:19.720 --> 45:25.560
Why not your presence you were about Costello in this overall gang picture as you knew it?

45:25.560 --> 45:28.840
Well, I knew that the question, man. So suppose you asked me the question.

45:28.840 --> 45:34.120
There's no trick in it. I just have this list of sex and I remember that you had a reason for not

45:34.120 --> 45:40.920
including Costello. Well, the main reason I had is that I never did find his name,

45:40.920 --> 45:44.440
mentioned in connection with any murder room, Brooklyn. I think you pointed that in.

45:45.400 --> 45:50.920
And at no time was his name mentioned at all in the investigation as I recall it,

45:51.720 --> 45:57.640
except in the turning in of Lucky. O'Duire is questioned about a war time meeting with the

45:57.640 --> 46:03.240
alleged gambling boss Frank Costello. Now would you kind of give to the committee just what the

46:03.240 --> 46:10.760
nature of the conversation was and a lot of things about army about air-coast contracts.

46:10.760 --> 46:16.040
In other words, will you just because of its possibly important related as near as you can,

46:16.040 --> 46:22.280
what was said by each of the parties during the coming? There wasn't a conversation between all of them.

46:22.280 --> 46:27.000
There was a conversation between Costello and me. That's the conversation we'd have had.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.960
And that conversation was not in the presence of the others.

46:30.920 --> 46:34.680
On one point O'Duire clashes head on with Senator Toby of New Hampshire.

46:35.640 --> 46:41.240
You've got bookmaking all over the country. They say there's a lot of it and

46:42.520 --> 46:47.960
New Hampshire too, $30 million a year. Well, I'd never seen it proved.

46:47.960 --> 46:53.960
Well, it's been on the papers. Yeah. They say that every New England bookmaker of any

46:53.960 --> 47:01.080
account spends their summers right in Bretton Woods in New Hampshire. That's what they say.

47:01.080 --> 47:07.000
I never heard that in your papers. I never heard that before. Do you want me to read it from the

47:07.000 --> 47:10.600
Manchester? You can send it to me, but special delivery mail. I'm your bladder read it to you.

47:10.600 --> 47:14.760
And I might say to you so that I don't believe anything I see in the Manchester Union.

47:14.760 --> 47:21.240
Well, I'll tell you. Well, we haven't got a Costello in New Hampshire. I wonder.

47:24.280 --> 47:31.480
The Senate crime probe, veriting out connections between New York political leaders and a

47:31.480 --> 47:37.320
leds gambling boss Frank Costello. Here, Senator Toby queers a reluctant Costello on his ideas

47:37.320 --> 47:39.960
of citizenship. Why did you want to be an American citizen?

47:44.520 --> 47:50.040
Well, I, of course, I love this country. Have you always upheld the Constitution and the laws of

47:50.040 --> 48:03.160
your state and nation? I believe I have. Have you ever offered your services to any war effort

48:03.160 --> 48:14.600
of this country? No. Baring in mind all that you've gained and received in wealth,

48:15.560 --> 48:18.280
what have you ever done for your country as a good citizen?

48:21.720 --> 48:25.880
Well, I don't know what you claim, what you mean by that.

48:25.880 --> 48:29.720
Well, you're looking back over the years and out at that time when you became a citizen.

48:29.720 --> 48:34.920
You're now standing 20 odd years after that. You must have in your mind something you've done

48:34.920 --> 48:38.360
that you can speak off to your credit as American citizen if so, what are they?

48:38.680 --> 48:41.560
I paid my tax.

48:49.560 --> 48:54.600
New York Fireman's Association head John Crane makes the hearings most sensational charge

48:54.600 --> 48:59.480
against former mayor William O'Duire, who had denied under oath ever receiving money from Crane.

48:59.560 --> 49:11.640
Paul, Mr. John, Mr. Crane, please. I told the mayor at that time that I had promised him the

49:11.640 --> 49:16.680
support of the fireman and I offered him some evidence of that support on the occasion

49:16.680 --> 49:25.720
in a form of $10,000. And was that in cash? I wasn't cash. And did he say anything?

49:26.120 --> 49:30.360
He said, he didn't look in the envelope or anything else.

49:30.360 --> 49:37.480
Committee Council Halleague questions Crane on payments totaling 55,000 to then Deputy Fire

49:37.480 --> 49:43.000
Commissioner James Moran. Did you make any to Mr. Moran? Oh, yes.

49:43.000 --> 49:52.760
And what contribution did you make to him? I made $2,000 contribution to him between that time and between

49:52.760 --> 50:00.520
election day. And were they also in cash? Yes. And where did you give them to Mr. Moran?

50:00.520 --> 50:07.400
He gave one behind him in his school building on his way home one night. Or one day I gave one on

50:07.400 --> 50:14.920
his office. Does that make it total of 55,000? 55,000. James Moran, good from you.

50:16.120 --> 50:21.640
The committee moves on to Washington to continue alerting the public on ties between crime and politics.

50:23.720 --> 50:38.600
Ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion I want to talk with you about the Senate crime

50:38.600 --> 50:44.040
investigating committee of which I had the pleasure of being chairman for almost two years during

50:44.040 --> 50:49.240
the six years that I have been in the United States Senate. I'm very proud of the work that

50:49.240 --> 50:55.320
our committee did. I have noticed a tendency on the part of one of my opponents and some other

50:55.960 --> 51:00.600
others who are associated with him to try to disparage into discredit the work of the Senate

51:00.600 --> 51:06.520
crime investigating committee saying it was a waste of money and a waste of time and it didn't

51:06.520 --> 51:12.760
accomplish anything. Well, I suppose the best man in the United States to testifiers to whether the

51:12.760 --> 51:18.680
Senate crime committee accomplish anything would be Mr. J. Edgar Hoover. The head of the federal

51:18.680 --> 51:25.640
Bureau of Investigation and during the time of our Senate crime committee investigation Mr.

51:25.640 --> 51:32.840
Hoover are a testified in connection with it and I want to read just a few excerpts from Mr.

51:32.840 --> 51:41.400
Hoover's testimony. This was on March 26, 1951 before our crime committee at which time I was chairman.

51:42.120 --> 51:46.920
Mr. Hoover, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, the members of this special committee

51:47.480 --> 51:51.880
of the United States Senate can take pride in its accomplishments during the past few months.

51:52.680 --> 51:56.600
You have developed facts which brought out into the open alliances and tangling

51:57.240 --> 52:02.600
alliances between the underworld and the upper world and unholy alliances between the criminal

52:02.600 --> 52:07.800
element and officialdom which established a shocking disregard for the law and order.

52:08.680 --> 52:12.520
Father Mr. Hoover said the work of this committee today has made great progress in

52:12.520 --> 52:18.520
awakening a public interest and a public consciousness in the widespread ramification of the underworld.

52:19.240 --> 52:22.840
The committee has not been freed from threats of violence and intimidation

52:23.400 --> 52:28.680
but you have gone ahead with determination objectively and fearlessly. Your hearings have been

52:28.680 --> 52:34.600
observed by millions of Americans on television screens and they have seen for themselves the arrogant

52:34.600 --> 52:40.120
defiance of those who can seal their endeavors and hide behind the protection of the Constitution

52:40.120 --> 52:45.560
for which they have so little regard. This awakened interest augures well for the future.

52:45.880 --> 52:49.640
I hope it will result in an increased zeal for civic responsibility.

52:50.360 --> 52:55.880
May I also express the hope that this committee under its particularly very able chairman.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.840
I appreciate Mr. Hoover saying that about me incidentally.

52:59.480 --> 53:05.080
We'll continue its unbiased, non-political exposure of the criminal element which has polluted

53:05.080 --> 53:10.440
all too many communities of our nation. And then Mr. Hoover goes on testifying it length

53:10.440 --> 53:15.240
about the work of this committee and I wish that all teniseans who are interested would read it.

53:16.280 --> 53:22.680
Well we may not have a great deal of organized crime or did not have in tenisee but all good

53:22.680 --> 53:28.200
citizens are interested in law enforcement and in seeing that the underworld does not affect the

53:28.200 --> 53:34.920
business or political life of our great nation. We will all recall that prior to 1950

53:35.960 --> 53:41.240
that it was well recognized that there had been a great growth in organized crime

53:41.240 --> 53:48.040
that it was operating on a nationwide syndicated basis powerful at many local communities and

53:48.040 --> 53:54.680
cities felt helpless to do anything about it. So that in the early part of 1950 I filed a resolution

53:54.680 --> 54:02.200
to have a special committee appointed to study the problems of organized crime in this nation.

54:03.080 --> 54:07.480
I fought for the creation of this committee through the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of

54:07.480 --> 54:13.960
the Senate over a great deal of opposition. Finally the committee was created and for almost two

54:13.960 --> 54:20.440
years in dozens and dozens of cities we held hundreds of hearings exposing to the spotlight of

54:20.440 --> 54:25.800
public opinion. They racketeers, the dope peddlers, the big-time murderers, murdering,

54:25.800 --> 54:32.680
cooperated the big-time gamblers and the hoodlums of this nation. But the people of the nation saw

54:32.680 --> 54:38.520
sick and saddened them. Here these people taking billions and billions of dollars away from the

54:38.520 --> 54:47.960
American people in narcotics, gambling, theft of automobiles, killing for hire had gotten very very

54:47.960 --> 54:53.960
powerful in this nation. They were eating at the heart of our democracy. Many places they had taken

54:54.680 --> 55:01.080
over. Their influence was felt in many counties and cities, in states and even at the federal level.

55:01.720 --> 55:06.440
They were trying to control elections in many many places and they were successful in a lot of them.

55:07.320 --> 55:13.320
Well as a result of it we found also that with all of this money they were getting into all kinds

55:13.320 --> 55:19.880
of legitimate businesses, even great big transportation companies. And then these businesses

55:19.880 --> 55:25.960
they use the same gangster tactics of unfair competition, gangster methods that they did in

55:25.960 --> 55:30.760
their underworld life. But even more important than that we found that like termites they were

55:30.760 --> 55:36.280
warming their way into government and politics at all levels. But many places the good people didn't

55:36.280 --> 55:42.440
have a chance. Well we know that we can lose our democracy by corruption and and difference and

55:42.440 --> 55:48.360
crime within just as we can lose it by invasion from without. We know that nations which in their

55:48.360 --> 55:55.480
time were as great as we are in our time have a past away into into into third rate nations

55:55.480 --> 56:00.360
or have lost their influence in the world. The cost of indifference and the influence of the

56:00.360 --> 56:06.760
criminal and corruption within. And we simply do not want that to happen to the United States of

56:06.760 --> 56:12.680
America. As a result of our crime committee these gangs were exposed. They were broken up.

56:13.480 --> 56:21.160
As the people in New York and Philadelphia in Miami and Tampa and New Orleans in Cleveland and

56:21.160 --> 56:27.720
Detroit in Chicago in Kansas City, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, what happened out there?

56:28.760 --> 56:35.240
We expose them. They have better law enforcement. Dozens and dozens of crime commissions have been

56:35.240 --> 56:40.600
formed. Better people are participating in government and we got the criminals on the run.

56:41.400 --> 56:47.640
Well as a result also of our crime investigating committee many very worthwhile federal laws were passed.

56:48.600 --> 56:52.680
The for instance one bill was passed to prohibit the interstate shipment of

56:53.480 --> 56:58.040
of our gambling devices from one state to the other which has had a very wholesome effect.

56:58.920 --> 57:03.720
It's interesting to note in passing that when that bill was up in the House of Representatives in

57:03.720 --> 57:11.800
August 1950, H.R. 807, that one of my opponents in this campaign offered an amendment to not

57:11.800 --> 57:20.200
allow the bill prohibiting the shipment of gambling devices to apply to any army camps or clubs

57:20.200 --> 57:25.000
or service men. Well the members of the Congress ridicule that saying do you want a different

57:25.000 --> 57:30.680
code of conduct? Do you want a different kind of morals for army camps and what not then you do

57:30.760 --> 57:38.120
for the rest of the public. So the amendment of my one of my opponents to this bill in which he tried

57:38.120 --> 57:45.640
to make this exemption was voted down at that time. State codes have been improved. There's been

57:45.640 --> 57:51.320
better law enforcement all over the United States. The hold of the gangster on this nation has been

57:51.320 --> 57:58.600
substantially broken and it will continue to be broken as long as we have an alert people who

57:58.600 --> 58:04.120
participate in government and see that the gangster doesn't get a hold on this. Well the back

58:04.120 --> 58:10.360
bone of this whole criminal organization in the United States, the thing that held it together

58:10.360 --> 58:16.520
from coast to coast, that kept the racketeers in touch with one another was the so-called continental

58:16.520 --> 58:22.760
wire service. That was the gambling wire service or the mob wire service as it's often called.

58:23.480 --> 58:31.400
It was owned by Mr. McBride, Mickey McBride of Cleveland, Ohio, and operated out of Chicago. Later

58:31.400 --> 58:37.400
Mr. McBride transferred a great deal of it to his son. They either got her stole information from

58:37.400 --> 58:44.040
the race tracks and put it on the wires instantly. It went out to hundreds and hundreds of sub-distributors

58:44.040 --> 58:50.120
and then from these sub-distributors to the gambling houses, the bookmakers, and to tens of

58:50.120 --> 58:55.400
thousands of people in all of the states of this union. It was around these gambling houses that

58:55.400 --> 59:03.480
other kinds of crime took place. That was a central figure, narcotics and murder and a feverate.

59:03.480 --> 59:10.040
It was around these sub-distributors that the mafia, this criminal underworld which we have broken

59:10.040 --> 59:16.520
up in this nation and which had such a powerful influence operated. This gambling wire service,

59:16.520 --> 59:22.520
we spent a great deal of time on. We exposed it for what it was and it had to go out of existence

59:22.520 --> 59:29.320
and Mr. McBride lost a very substantial investment in it. It is at least of passing interest to the

59:29.320 --> 59:38.200
people of Tennessee that Mr. McBride was a business partner with Mr. Robert G. Venn of Miami Florida.

59:38.200 --> 59:45.160
Mr. McBride and his associates owned a radio station there, WEMI in which Mr. Venn had an interest

59:45.160 --> 59:51.720
and was the general manager. Mr. Venn through this radio station constantly opposed the work of our

59:51.720 --> 59:58.120
crime committee. He also opposed the work of the greater Miami crime commission which was trying to

59:58.120 --> 01:00:05.960
get the hoodlums out of Miami. Here's the letter setting up the contract between Mr. McBride and Mr. Venn in

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:16.040
August 1948. This is the first time that I have known of in Tennessee that a professional

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.160
publicist who has come into the state to try to sell a political candidate. It's just like an

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:27.640
advanced man for a carnival or selling soap. It's a little bit unusual that this man who has

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:35.080
associated for so long and still is, as far as I know, with Mr. Arthur B. McBride's interest,

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.680
should be the one to come into Tennessee to try to defeat me. Well undoubtedly, these have been

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:46.840
many retaliations and threats of trying to take me out of public life. They're not on my side and

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:52.760
I don't want them on my side. Look at some of these trucks holding around gambling devices in

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.800
Tennessee. You'll see that they have a candidate for the United States Senate, all right, but that

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:03.240
candidate is not Estus Keefer. I don't want them on my side and I will always fight this

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:09.000
connection between crime and politics. I think that people of Tennessee are perfectly

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.680
capable of electing a United States Senator without the intervention of someone who would be

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.320
inspired not to be very friendly because we put the mob wire service out of business.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.800
Well, among the other statutes that we got passed in the federal government as a result of our

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:33.320
crime investigation was a mandatory sentence for dope peddlers and sellers after their first

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.840
defense. And this has done a whole lot to clean up the narcotics condition in this country as Mr.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:45.800
Enzlinger, the head of the Bureau of Narcotics will tell you. Then we also recommended to the Congress

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:51.480
and that the Immigration and Naturalization Act be amended so that we could deport some of

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:57.080
these dozens and dozens of leading racketeers in this country who were the heads of some of these

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:03.000
criminal centricates, many of them were naturalized Americans. And I don't think the United States

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.520
owes there many obligation to keep them here when they engage in terrible criminal activity.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:16.840
Well, the law was and it used to be very, very strict on deporting these people, but upon

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.360
our recommendation the law was amended so that they could be deported if they committed some

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.240
act of moral turpitude for which they were convicted within five years after they were admitted.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:34.920
Or if it was more than five years if they committed two acts. And the judge had to, and this would

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:40.120
be true unless the judge at the time of the hearing, or they're in 30 days thereafter, recommended

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:46.680
against deportation. Well, one of my opponents for some strange reason, I don't know what the,

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:51.880
I don't know of any of these criminal aliens in Tennessee who were interested. They weren't

01:02:51.880 --> 01:03:01.640
any of them in Tennessee. On April 22, 1951, introduced a bill, HR 4794, which would allow the judge

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:08.120
any time, any time up to deportation to recommend against deportation. This was taken up with the

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.800
Attorney General of the United States who said that it would have the result of preventing the

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.480
deportation of many alien criminals who ran this country and who ought to be deported. Well,

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:27.320
that's a very interesting situation to develop. I don't know what people it was intended to prevent

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.960
from being deported, but it certainly would have afforded the work of the Attorney General of the

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.000
United States, and it would have afforded the recommendation of our Crime Commission Committee.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:43.720
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we must always keep America a clean nation, free from the influence of

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:50.520
the recordiers and mobsters, and I'm going to keep on doing the best I can, regardless of what

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:55.960
pressure our effort may be used against me and this campaign are in the future. Thank you very much.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:12.600
This is Esther's key for campaigning for the presidency. I want to talk with you about some of the

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:18.280
vital issues of today. Today, let us talk about corruption. We have all been shocked and a little

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:25.240
more terrified by the evidence of corruption at many levels of government in Washington, in some states,

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:31.320
and in some cities. The situation must be cleaned up. Confidence in government must be fully

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:37.880
restored. Politics must be made completely honest again. As president, I would make this my first

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.320
order of business. Working together with the states and local governments and honest citizens

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:49.240
everywhere, we can put the recordiers, the influence peddlers, and the pay chislers out of business,

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:56.440
out of government, and cause their influence to be diminished in this country. We cannot face the

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:02.600
perils of tomorrow unless we have absolute integrity all the way through our government at every level.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:12.840
Thank you very much for listening. I hope you will help me in my effort.
