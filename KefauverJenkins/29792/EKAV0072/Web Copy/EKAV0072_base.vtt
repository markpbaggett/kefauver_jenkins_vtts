WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I'm very happy to have with me today in the

00:11.000 --> 00:18.520
studio one of the finest members of the United States Senate, man who works hard for progressive

00:18.520 --> 00:26.120
legislation who is effective in his presentation of legislative proposals and of his viewpoint.

00:26.120 --> 00:32.240
He has been to Tennessee on many occasions and we consider him one of our Tennessee's

00:32.240 --> 00:38.480
and best friends and I think one of the very ablest members of the Senate, Wayne Morris

00:38.480 --> 00:39.480
of Oregon.

00:39.480 --> 00:40.960
It certainly is good to have you with us.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.960
Well, that's just very kind to let me visit with you and your constituents on this program.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.440
You can close your ears for just a moment because I know you're a modest man.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.480
Well, I want to send you your constituents.

00:51.480 --> 00:57.880
It's a privilege to work with us as Keith Offer in the Senate and I want to thank him and

00:57.880 --> 01:02.800
view of his constituents for the wonderful help he was to me a few days ago as we carried

01:02.800 --> 01:09.080
through the Senate by a vote of 49 to 34, the federal aid education bill.

01:09.080 --> 01:13.160
As Keith Offer was a great help to me, it's a bill that's going to be of great help to

01:13.160 --> 01:18.920
Tennessee because you're going to get a substantial contribution from the federal government

01:18.920 --> 01:24.800
to be of assistance in your schools but with complete state control of the expenditure

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
of the money.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.800
Well, Wayne, thank you very much for your nice remarks.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.560
You've been not as thoughtful going down to Knoxville and other places in Tennessee making

01:33.560 --> 01:38.840
speeches to our people on several occasions.

01:38.840 --> 01:43.240
Senator Morris is a member of the Labor and Public Works Committee and is chairman of

01:43.240 --> 01:46.000
the Education Subcommittee.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.960
And I think one of the best legislative handling of a bill that I have seen, but ever since

01:51.960 --> 01:57.400
I've been in the United States Senate, was the remarkable way that he steered the education

01:57.400 --> 02:02.640
bill through the United States Senate recently without any crippling amendments involving

02:02.640 --> 02:10.720
either race or religion, got through a fine clean bill which is now in the House of Representatives.

02:10.720 --> 02:18.080
This bill, I believe, provides $850 million a year for school construction and to supplement

02:18.080 --> 02:21.200
teachers salaries over a three-year period.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.200
Is that right?

02:22.200 --> 02:23.200
Yes, that's the system.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.760
$850 million per year bill.

02:26.760 --> 02:31.160
And it's child bill for three years or triad for three years.

02:31.160 --> 02:36.080
I'm satisfied that after three years the American people will insist that it be continued.

02:36.080 --> 02:40.880
But you know, as to say, the fear argument that's been used for so long against federal

02:40.880 --> 02:46.280
aid to education is that you can't have federal contributions to the states without the federal

02:46.280 --> 02:49.480
government somehow dominating education.

02:49.480 --> 02:54.720
Now there's no basis in that argument, but as long as the fear exists, you got to face

02:54.720 --> 02:56.080
up to the fear.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.040
So we have passed a bill that's for a three-year trial period.

03:00.040 --> 03:05.680
It is a bill that has an equalization formula in it, which simply means that the states that

03:05.680 --> 03:09.960
need the money the most will get the larger share of the money.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.240
And why do we put it on that basis?

03:12.240 --> 03:18.280
Because we take the position that every boy and girl in this country is entitled to an

03:18.280 --> 03:22.680
equal chance to develop his or her intellectual power.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.400
And that's where the national interest comes in.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.040
Now, how do we protect the states?

03:29.040 --> 03:34.080
We protect the states by making it perfectly clear in the bill that the money goes to the

03:34.080 --> 03:40.800
states is co-mingled with state educational funds is spent by the states and the cardinance

03:40.800 --> 03:42.680
with state educational policy.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.440
Now, I've been in this struggle for many, many years in the Senate.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.000
I've been in the Senate now going on 17 years.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.600
I was a co-sponsor of the Taff Bill in 47 of the Taff Thompson Bill in 49.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.800
We passed both of those through the Senate.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.880
I've introduced these bills year after year since I've been in the Senate.

04:01.880 --> 04:07.680
And last year, we passed what is known as Senate Bill number eight.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.440
It is almost identical with the bill that we just passed the other day in the Senate.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.440
I want to make one more point.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.240
I don't want to make speech as this one.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.240
You're doing fine with how to explain this.

04:17.240 --> 04:22.560
I want to tell you, people in Tennessee are very much interested in this bill.

04:22.560 --> 04:28.520
And I think the great majority of people realize that we need it in Tennessee.

04:28.520 --> 04:35.440
It will make available $23,500,000 for school construction and to supplement teacher

04:35.440 --> 04:37.800
salvers in the next fiscal year in Tennessee.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.840
So you're making a fine speech.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.840
You go right on that.

04:40.840 --> 04:46.480
Well, another one that covers school construction and teacher salaries, but you can also use it

04:46.480 --> 04:52.480
for any other educational purpose in public, elementary and secondary schools.

04:52.480 --> 04:57.520
For example, if you need to use it for equipment in your physics and chemistry laboratories,

04:57.520 --> 04:59.520
it can be used for that purpose too.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.680
We leave that decision up to you at the state.

05:02.680 --> 05:09.640
But let me point out that I think the argument that helps us defeat those that keep stirring

05:09.640 --> 05:14.960
up opposition to federal aid to education with the false charge that it will lead to federal

05:14.960 --> 05:16.440
domination of schools.

05:16.440 --> 05:24.200
So we pointed out that one third of the children in secondary and elementary schools in the

05:24.200 --> 05:31.080
country have been getting federal aid for 10 years and to the tune of two billions of

05:31.080 --> 05:32.240
dollars.

05:32.240 --> 05:37.600
All of us as taxpayers have contributed to about a third of the public school population

05:37.600 --> 05:42.680
in this country and elementary and secondary schools, two billion dollars.

05:42.680 --> 05:46.960
Under what is known is public law 874 and 815.

05:46.960 --> 05:52.400
Those are the two bills that cover the so-called federally impacted areas of the country,

05:52.400 --> 05:57.400
and the federal government has an atomic energy plant or a military reservation or some

05:57.400 --> 06:04.320
other federal installation that brings in many families working for the federal government

06:04.320 --> 06:06.160
with many children.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.160
And then we have Spence and...

06:08.160 --> 06:13.080
Well, in that connection we have a great many military installations in Tennessee, Oak

06:13.080 --> 06:14.080
Ridge, Tallahoma.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.080
Oh, yes.

06:15.080 --> 06:21.080
And may I say that the Senator Keith Offer was on the ball, so to speak, because the

06:21.080 --> 06:26.080
original bill that came before us, and I had this always unpleasant when you have to

06:26.080 --> 06:31.080
disagree with your administration, I had the unpleasant task of informing the administration

06:31.080 --> 06:35.160
that we would not accept that section of the original proposal of the administration

06:35.160 --> 06:40.880
bill that sought to cut back drastically on these school districts that are now receiving

06:40.880 --> 06:44.360
federal funds in the federally impacted area.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.400
18 Senators and your Senator was one of them.

06:47.440 --> 06:52.400
18 Senators called our attention to the fact that it would do a great injustice to their

06:52.400 --> 06:55.280
states, so we struck that from the bill.

06:55.280 --> 07:00.880
And we continue under this bill to provide this federal money for these federally impacted

07:00.880 --> 07:01.880
school districts.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.680
But then I want to take you back to 1863.

07:05.680 --> 07:14.640
In 1863, the Moral Act was signed, which provided federal aids to every land grant

07:14.640 --> 07:15.640
college in America.

07:15.640 --> 07:21.080
You people in Tennessee have been the beneficiaries of that, to the tune of tens upon tens of

07:21.080 --> 07:25.560
thousands of dollars to your land grant colleges, as there's every other state.

07:25.560 --> 07:30.360
And then we've had a whole series of other special forms of aid to the schools of the

07:30.360 --> 07:32.200
country for years.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.840
So what we, well, we got their school lunch program.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.560
School lunch program is another example of it.

07:38.560 --> 07:43.680
So we just, we just rode on this argument, so to speak.

07:43.680 --> 07:48.960
And the Senate, once it got the facts, saw that there was no basis in fact for the argument

07:48.960 --> 07:52.120
that our bill would jeopardize local control of education.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.880
I'm proud of this bill.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.560
I'm proud of the wonderful support that we got for our bill.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.400
And I again want to thank Senator Kiefer for his help.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.680
Well, that was a great legislative achievement.

08:02.680 --> 08:06.480
And you were the Generalissimo guiding us in the Senate.

08:06.480 --> 08:11.880
And I have a feeling that such a good record was made and your arguments were so persuasive

08:11.880 --> 08:16.400
in favor of this bill that we have the best chance of getting a bill through the House

08:16.400 --> 08:18.800
of Representatives we've had in many, many years.

08:18.800 --> 08:19.800
How do you feel about that?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.960
Well, I'm very hopeful that we can get it through the House.

08:21.960 --> 08:27.120
And if the people listening to this telecast want to help the schoolboys and girls of

08:27.120 --> 08:33.440
this country, see to it that your House representative's no-year views on it because I close my

08:33.440 --> 08:39.320
comment of this education bill with a truism I'd have you never forget.

08:39.320 --> 08:45.480
I consider this bill a great defense measure because as I've said so many times, but we'll

08:45.480 --> 08:50.160
keep right on saying it until all the American people recognize it's truth.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.520
We just can't keep ahead of Russia in manpower.

08:54.520 --> 09:00.440
But we Americans better see to it that we keep ahead of Russia in brainpower.

09:00.440 --> 09:06.600
And that's why we need this federal aid education bill to help you people in the states meet

09:06.600 --> 09:09.960
your educational responsibilities because how you're doing it now.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.480
You're doing it by overtaxing your real property.

09:13.480 --> 09:19.320
And many taxpayer listening to me who owns real property knows how right I am.

09:19.320 --> 09:25.840
We've already increased the taxes on real property to support our schools far below

09:25.840 --> 09:29.160
beyond the role of fairness.

09:29.160 --> 09:34.360
It's about time that we get some tax help from the federal government that will help the

09:34.360 --> 09:38.960
local taxpayer meet the school expenses of this district.

09:38.960 --> 09:43.240
Well I wish we could go on about the education bill because it is so very important for

09:43.240 --> 09:49.400
all of us and we're certainly going to work hard to do what we can to get it through the

09:49.400 --> 09:55.800
House of Representatives and I hope that anyone interested may be in touch with our congressman.

09:55.800 --> 10:02.560
But you know Senator Morris is a distinguished and has been for some time a member of the

10:02.560 --> 10:04.200
Foreign Relations Committee.

10:04.200 --> 10:09.560
And as such he is the chairman of the Latin American Subcommittee.

10:09.560 --> 10:15.120
In addition to this he has was the member of the United States delegation to the 15th

10:15.120 --> 10:18.200
General Assembly of the United Nations.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.440
We're all interested way in and don't have the benefit of hearing the executive testimony

10:22.440 --> 10:27.760
before the Foreign Relations Committee and how we stand in Latin America and what can

10:27.760 --> 10:33.920
we do to restore our prestige and get in better shape with our neighbors to the south of

10:33.920 --> 10:34.920
us.

10:34.920 --> 10:39.200
Well as to I wish I could report that in my opinion we stand high but we don't.

10:39.200 --> 10:45.200
I don't suppose our prestige has been lower in Latin America at any time in the last 20

10:45.200 --> 10:49.360
years and it has been during the last few years.

10:49.360 --> 10:53.200
I think our policy has been very bad in Latin America.

10:53.200 --> 10:59.220
I speak most respectfully and non-partisanly but factually when I point out that the Latin

10:59.220 --> 11:05.760
American program of the preceding administration is chief cause I think for the great slump

11:05.760 --> 11:08.800
in Latin American U.S. relations.

11:08.800 --> 11:14.400
We've got to stop U.S. unilateral action toward Latin America.

11:14.400 --> 11:19.800
We've got to adopt a program and present Kennedy's program now called Alliance Progress

11:19.800 --> 11:22.760
will accomplish that end if it's implemented.

11:22.760 --> 11:28.960
We've got to get our friends in Latin America to join with us in a cooperative Latin American

11:28.960 --> 11:29.960
program.

11:29.960 --> 11:36.360
And that means of course that the organization of American states which is based upon a treaty

11:36.360 --> 11:42.080
signed by 21 nations including us has really got to be implemented.

11:42.080 --> 11:47.280
And we've got to bring in our friends in Latin America to join with us in developing

11:47.280 --> 11:50.400
a Latin American program on a cooperative basis.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.600
And we've got to stop taking the attitudes that we the United States are going to call

11:55.600 --> 11:57.240
the tune in Latin America.

11:57.240 --> 12:02.560
Well we're not going to do it even if we try because if we continue to follow the policy

12:02.560 --> 12:07.120
we've been following in Cuba and no one has opposed cast through more than I have.

12:07.120 --> 12:12.000
I have led the fight in the Senate as chairman of the subcommittee in Latin America against

12:12.000 --> 12:17.760
the cast through regime because I'm perfectly convinced that it's a comeline regime and

12:17.760 --> 12:22.680
that Moscow is dictating in large measure the policies of Castro.

12:22.680 --> 12:27.240
But that doesn't justify unilateral action on the part of the United States.

12:27.240 --> 12:33.920
And so I am urging that we go through the organization of American states and work

12:33.920 --> 12:35.920
out a cooperative program with them.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.920
As you know Estes I was one of the two congressional delegates to the Bogota conference last

12:40.920 --> 12:44.640
September that came back with the act of Bogota.

12:44.640 --> 12:51.240
The act of Bogota is an aid program or proposes an aid program for Latin America with United

12:51.240 --> 12:53.000
States help.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.800
But not with full payment for the United States and I want to very quickly say we have said

12:57.800 --> 13:01.280
very clearly and we must make it clear to Latin America.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.120
We'll help Latin America if Latin America is willing to help itself.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.920
Now you say Mr. Senator what must Latin America do to get our help?

13:08.920 --> 13:11.600
Well I want to name a few things very quickly.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.400
You know the main past time in Latin America is tax evasion.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.720
The Latin Americans are going to have to pay taxes.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.720
They're going to have to raise money to help themselves.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.560
They got to have a program of land reform, social justice reform.

13:25.560 --> 13:30.400
That's the kind of a program that the president Kennedy is supporting and that I endorse.

13:30.400 --> 13:36.440
Well you know I know the people who are viewing this program feel as I do that they're

13:36.440 --> 13:38.560
awfully sorry that has to be brought to an end.

13:38.560 --> 13:43.840
It's been very fine of you to come and come down to Tennessee to see us soon and thank

13:43.840 --> 13:44.840
you very much.

13:44.840 --> 13:45.840
Thank you very much.

13:45.840 --> 13:46.840
Thank you.

13:46.840 --> 13:47.840
That's all for now ladies and gentlemen.

14:00.400 --> 14:07.960
Ladies and gentlemen friends of Tennessee I think all of us realize that the strength

14:07.960 --> 14:14.600
of the Western nations of Europe and of the and the United States and Canada offer the

14:14.600 --> 14:20.920
greatest hope and assurance for peace if we can stand together and work together all

14:20.920 --> 14:30.040
one for all and all for one militarily, economically and politically so that in 1949 the North

14:30.040 --> 14:33.960
Atlantic Treaty organization was created.

14:33.960 --> 14:40.280
And after this time we have gotten along although we've had many differences between the 15

14:40.280 --> 14:43.880
nations from passing what we call NATO.

14:43.880 --> 14:51.840
Many of us have been interested for a long long time in having a citizens commission to work

14:51.840 --> 14:55.400
as it with other commissions of other NATO nations.

14:55.960 --> 15:02.760
A limited number to meet and to continue to discuss ways and means of improving the techniques

15:02.760 --> 15:09.120
and the operations and the unity of our North Atlantic Treaty organization.

15:09.120 --> 15:13.560
And last fall this resolution was passed by the Congress of the United States after

15:13.560 --> 15:14.560
an effort.

15:14.560 --> 15:23.080
And in March of this year the United States commission was created consisting of 20 members.

15:23.080 --> 15:28.320
Today we're very honored in having with us the co-chairman of the United States Citizens

15:28.320 --> 15:30.320
Commission on NATO.

15:30.320 --> 15:35.720
They're men that you will know well and it's a great privilege and pleasure to have with

15:35.720 --> 15:44.920
us in the studio Mr. Will Clayton of Tennessee and Texas, a former great undersecretary of

15:44.920 --> 15:49.560
state and one of the fine and great men of our nation.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.800
Mr. Will is good to have you with us today.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.240
I certainly appreciate it.

15:54.240 --> 16:01.520
And then I'll Mr. Clayton's right is Mr. Christian Hearder, a very able well-known governor,

16:01.520 --> 16:08.160
former governor of Massachusetts and the secretary of state who served with great distinction and

16:08.160 --> 16:14.840
merit and honor until we Democrats took over here recently.

16:14.840 --> 16:20.920
Mr. Will first, we end on the sea of always been tremendously fond of you because you grew

16:20.920 --> 16:23.720
up I believe at Jackson, Tennessee.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.320
Thank you, I did.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.480
I was read in Jackson.

16:31.480 --> 16:37.960
Left island I was 15 years old when I have a very warm spot in my heart for Tennessee.

16:37.960 --> 16:45.720
Yes sir and then after you became the head of Anderson's Clayton Company, one of our greatest

16:45.720 --> 16:52.960
cotton company in the world and you were here as in government, you found a place called

16:52.960 --> 16:57.360
Lookout Mountain and you built a home there and lived there for a number of years didn't

16:57.360 --> 16:58.360
you?

16:58.360 --> 16:59.960
Yes.

16:59.960 --> 17:06.000
We had a summer home and lived there for 20 summers I think.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.640
Well I can certify it because it's a wonderful place to spend the summer.

17:10.640 --> 17:15.080
We have a between the bank and the insurance company and I see and I have a summer house

17:15.080 --> 17:16.080
up there ourselves.

17:16.080 --> 17:27.800
Well Mr. Hearder tell us about the work of the United States citizens commission and what

17:27.800 --> 17:33.160
is the trouble with Nate toward the present time and what are we aiming at?

17:33.160 --> 17:35.160
Well you bet for a pretty wide field.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.160
Well you guess I can get a little part.

17:37.160 --> 17:45.360
It is the commission as you know only got organized shortly after its appointment and in

17:45.360 --> 17:50.400
recent weeks various members of the commission including real Clayton myself have been traveling

17:50.400 --> 17:56.960
to different countries in order to stimulate the creation of similar committees in the

17:56.960 --> 18:01.760
NATO countries so that in time we could organize a type of convention that was envisaged

18:01.760 --> 18:04.280
in the resolution.

18:04.280 --> 18:09.800
I think that that is progressing but it is a slow process because in the good many cases

18:09.800 --> 18:15.400
it is not entirely clear just how the committee should be set up and we have set a rather unusual

18:15.400 --> 18:20.360
precedent that others can't necessarily with some of their parliamentary restrictions follow

18:20.360 --> 18:23.320
any objectives in detail.

18:23.320 --> 18:29.000
Into further work of the commission is concerned I agree entirely with the very first words

18:29.000 --> 18:36.440
you said but perhaps the most important thing today the priority from the front of view

18:36.440 --> 18:41.920
of the free world is to make certain that the free nation for the world as represented

18:41.920 --> 18:48.600
in large measure by the United community should be operating from a military political and

18:48.600 --> 18:53.080
economic point of view in as close to the unit as it possibly yet.

18:54.080 --> 18:59.680
I have been different as you know I think there is so well known that I am rather not going

18:59.680 --> 19:04.760
to the detail of the difficulty but I think that among the free nations this is a characteristic

19:04.760 --> 19:09.200
of free peoples that they do have differences as far as makes us strong I guess it doesn't

19:09.200 --> 19:14.520
need but I think that the responsibility that is well Clayton and the members of our commission

19:14.520 --> 19:22.320
have is to examine other difficulties and to explore as the resolution says rage in which

19:22.320 --> 19:30.840
this group of the free world can strengthen the democratic free world in a very suspected

19:30.840 --> 19:35.120
of a laid out particularly in the economic and the political field.

19:35.120 --> 19:46.120
Well Mr. Will we usually think of NATO as a military alliance and I know that you have another

19:46.120 --> 19:54.840
idea about an important part of NATO tell us about the other parts the political and the

19:54.840 --> 19:55.840
economic.

19:55.840 --> 20:05.320
Well I am particularly interested in Article 2 of the NATO agreement which provides that

20:05.320 --> 20:15.160
the members of NATO which are now 15 countries shall cooperate together from the point of

20:15.160 --> 20:29.320
view of strengthening their economic ties and cooperate in an economic sense as well as

20:29.320 --> 20:40.160
a military sense and that Article 2 has not been put into operation to the extent that

20:40.160 --> 20:47.160
I think it should be and we are hoping that we may be able to make some suggestions

20:47.160 --> 20:54.440
as a result of the deliberations of this United States Citizens Commission on NATO that

20:54.440 --> 20:56.800
will contribute to that end.

20:56.800 --> 21:01.080
Well Chris and Herrers said that you and he had been together to a number of nations

21:01.080 --> 21:03.480
where have you been Mr. Will?

21:03.480 --> 21:11.480
We visited London and then bond and then Rome and then Paris for nations and Mr. Hader

21:11.480 --> 21:13.400
Sensen has been to Canada.

21:13.400 --> 21:18.680
And did you find what kind of reaction did you find among the people and the nations

21:18.680 --> 21:20.480
that you went to?

21:20.480 --> 21:31.960
We found a warm reception in all of those countries and a desire to cooperate with us in every

21:31.960 --> 21:34.960
possible way.

21:34.960 --> 21:43.680
Of course this commission setting up of this commission is rather a new thing in our country

21:43.680 --> 21:50.240
and it certainly is new in that country that there should be a Citizens Commission that

21:50.240 --> 21:57.800
would report to the government but would have no right to commit to government in any

21:57.800 --> 21:58.800
way.

21:58.800 --> 22:06.280
Well it is I think the commission we have is probably one of a very few of its type but

22:06.280 --> 22:12.760
I have had the feeling that with wise men dedicated men like yourselves and I want to say

22:12.760 --> 22:19.720
that I have never known a commission that had Abler, may unwell you do have one fine woman

22:19.720 --> 22:21.840
on the commission too.

22:21.840 --> 22:28.080
I received no compensation who has a matter of good for the world and for the country

22:28.080 --> 22:35.680
who are giving them their time, thought and brains and influence towards this great effort.

22:35.680 --> 22:40.600
Kristen, Mr. Clayton said you had been up to Canada.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.720
What was your reaction there?

22:43.720 --> 22:45.920
What the Canadians do about it?

22:45.920 --> 22:53.760
Well the Canadian I saw members of the government as well as the various members of the parliamentary

22:53.760 --> 22:59.560
bodies who had been concerned many of the NATO parliamentarians and they would like

22:59.560 --> 23:04.200
to work out a method of representation to set up a commission.

23:04.200 --> 23:10.600
They are very much interested as you know in Canada at the moment there is a really

23:10.600 --> 23:17.640
discussion going on because of the influence at least in some of Mr. McMillan statements

23:17.640 --> 23:24.040
that the British are going to join the common market and Canada naturally wondering as one

23:24.040 --> 23:29.160
of the commonwealth countries what is going to become of the her special privilege is

23:29.160 --> 23:31.840
as a commonwealth country in the British market.

23:31.840 --> 23:38.640
So it's a pretty hot subject but I think that the Canadians all of those that I spoke to

23:38.640 --> 23:44.040
feel that the exploration in which the commissions of this kind might make the other might be

23:44.040 --> 23:45.640
very helpful and very useful.

23:46.280 --> 23:51.000
Well, Kristen, how about Mr. Diffinbacker, the Prime Minister of Canada?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.240
He's been very much interested in hasn't he?

23:54.240 --> 23:58.120
Yes, he's been very much interested but he is very much concerned about this move for

23:58.120 --> 24:02.920
the British at the moment and he is asked for meeting of the Prime Ministers of all the

24:02.920 --> 24:05.120
commonwealth countries to discuss it.

24:05.120 --> 24:08.600
I don't know whether that will come about or not because I know he said the British are

24:08.600 --> 24:14.160
sending very high ranking ministers to those countries now to Australia and New Zealand

24:14.160 --> 24:17.080
and Canada to discuss the relations that come to us.

24:17.080 --> 24:21.080
They're also sending another high commissioner to some of their asianic members of the

24:21.080 --> 24:22.080
commonwealth.

24:22.080 --> 24:26.440
Well, the NATO parliamentarians in Canada have a meeting and take action.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.440
Are you with them?

24:27.440 --> 24:28.440
Yes, they did.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.280
They discussed a thing from beginning to end.

24:31.280 --> 24:37.280
We've been to one hour discussing very phases of it and then they have to resolution favouring

24:37.280 --> 24:38.280
it.

24:38.280 --> 24:45.560
So that Greece, one of our NATO nations has already set up a council or a commission similar

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
to ours.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.400
How would they Mr. Will?

24:48.400 --> 24:53.560
Yes, and they may say call a Hellenic citizens commission on NATO.

24:53.560 --> 24:59.360
I've always been impressed with the fact that if a military alliance is going to survive

24:59.360 --> 25:05.840
if we're going to have unity and strength that we had to have some better means of political

25:05.840 --> 25:12.160
consultation, not that we follow on another's political policy in every case, but we all

25:12.160 --> 25:15.360
at least each know what the others doing.

25:15.360 --> 25:20.080
Like in the case, you were Secretary of State, I believe, or were you Mr. Herder when the

25:20.080 --> 25:21.880
Suez of Fair came?

25:21.880 --> 25:24.200
I was under Secretary of that time.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.440
You were under Secretary of State.

25:26.440 --> 25:32.120
And the French and British took move and it had not been discussed with the United States

25:32.120 --> 25:35.240
although it involved the whole world.

25:35.240 --> 25:40.600
Is that part of the things that you will be talking about when you meet with these representatives

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
of other countries?

25:41.600 --> 25:48.200
Well, one of the problems in NATO that has always arisen has been so-called political consultation

25:48.200 --> 25:55.440
that is the effort to try to get a common meeting ground and a common policy.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.600
It improved very, very considerably.

25:58.600 --> 26:08.240
But it is never going to be completely satisfactory in my way of thinking until our political ties

26:08.240 --> 26:10.760
are stronger than the other present times.

26:10.760 --> 26:14.880
And that will be part of the things that you will try to bring about, Mr. Chair.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.880
That's right.

26:15.880 --> 26:21.280
How do you view the General Western Atlantic picture of the present time, Mr. Will?

26:21.280 --> 26:34.240
I think that it illustrates very strongly the need for some means of bringing the Western

26:34.240 --> 26:39.560
of NATO countries and the OECD countries closer together.

26:39.560 --> 26:49.320
If we are to successfully defend ourselves in America against the monolithic power of the

26:49.320 --> 26:56.640
Soviet Union plus Chinese, they have a billion people now which is one out of every three

26:56.640 --> 26:58.480
in the world.

26:58.480 --> 27:05.120
And if it ever should get to be two out of three, I think the world has lost its freedom.

27:05.120 --> 27:12.320
Well, I just want to say all my own ladies and gentlemen that I think are great hope for

27:12.320 --> 27:18.000
pieces in the Atlantic community and free people standing together.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.600
I think that Mr. Clayton and Mr. Header and the others on this commission are rendering

27:24.600 --> 27:29.920
a great public service and trying to bring about ways and means so that we can stand together

27:29.920 --> 27:31.920
well better.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.360
We are indebted to them.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.320
It may make the difference between peace and war in the days to come.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.200
So Mr. Will Clayton, I want to thank you very much for being with us.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.200
Yes.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.840
Because the Commander is all for nicely your coming.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.440
Be with us and we all appreciate it.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.440
That's all for now.

27:47.440 --> 27:48.440
Thank you very much.

27:48.440 --> 28:09.520
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, these days we are all interested in instrumentalities

28:09.520 --> 28:11.240
of peace.

28:11.240 --> 28:15.320
We have been thinking for a long time all of us about how we can have person to person

28:15.320 --> 28:22.600
to contact and the interest to better understanding and eventual peace relations in the world.

28:22.600 --> 28:28.720
In this Congress there was no organization or new plan that started out with more skepticism,

28:28.720 --> 28:35.120
more doubt about it, more an organization and turned out to have general approbation

28:35.120 --> 28:37.240
and approval and peace core.

28:37.240 --> 28:42.240
But we have all heard so much about in which we are so interested in.

28:42.240 --> 28:46.680
We are very honored today to have with us the man who has organized the peace core,

28:46.680 --> 28:51.400
who is its general director, who is giving it a very wonderful direction.

28:51.400 --> 28:58.000
It is taking many nations of the world, sergeant's tribe, sergeant sugar to have you with us

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
today and to talk to my people in Tennessee and other states that may be listening and watching.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Thank you, Senator.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.600
I am very happy to be here and have this chance to tell the people of Tennessee on your

29:10.600 --> 29:14.520
program something about what the peace core is doing and what it hopes to do.

29:14.520 --> 29:19.160
Before you do that, we all call you sergeant and everybody thinks that you might have been

29:19.160 --> 29:24.720
a sergeant in the army or something, but actually you weren't a sergeant where you were.

29:24.720 --> 29:29.680
No I wasn't, but it just happened to be my name, but I do make the point that sergeant

29:29.680 --> 29:32.400
is the highest rank in the peace core.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.920
We have very few animals around us.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.400
We don't have any generals or admirals, but actually I think you were a lieutenant commander

29:37.400 --> 29:38.640
in the Navy weren't you.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.640
That's right, yes I was.

29:39.640 --> 29:44.600
And I may say, incidentally, a very successful businessman who has given up his business to

29:44.600 --> 29:50.720
devote it to this and very great coves.

29:50.720 --> 29:57.400
Well, sergeant Tennessee has been playing a very important part in the peace core not only

29:57.400 --> 30:03.920
as the daughter of our junior senator, Senator Gore and Nancy, one of your good volunteers

30:03.920 --> 30:05.520
and the very star, isn't it?

30:05.520 --> 30:09.560
That's right, Nancy's worked at our headquarters and the beginning has done a fine job too.

30:09.560 --> 30:15.640
And then I believe Sam Babitt, who is the dean of students at Vanderbilt University,

30:15.640 --> 30:17.480
is part of your organization?

30:17.480 --> 30:21.480
Yes, I'm happy to say he is no longer the dean at Vanderbilt.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.520
He's now working full-time for us.

30:23.520 --> 30:28.120
He had a very successful and distinguished career in that work at Vanderbilt tonight with us.

30:28.120 --> 30:32.880
That's a great loss to Vanderbilt, but it's a great game to you.

30:32.880 --> 30:40.640
Then I believe Dr. Nicholas Hobbs, who was the, or maybe his, the professor of psychology

30:40.640 --> 30:45.680
at P. Barat University, was head of this election group for the peace core was enough.

30:45.680 --> 30:46.680
Yes, that's true, Senator.

30:46.680 --> 30:51.160
And I think Nick Hobbs deserves a great deal of credit for the early success, which the

30:51.160 --> 30:56.960
peace core has gained overseas because the payoff so far as the peace core is concerned

30:56.960 --> 31:01.400
is how well does it do in the foreign country after the volunteers get there?

31:01.400 --> 31:04.360
How well does the volunteers do their job?

31:04.360 --> 31:09.600
And Nick Hobbs was the person responsible for the selection of all of the peace core volunteers

31:09.600 --> 31:11.800
who are overseas now.

31:11.800 --> 31:19.760
And we were talking about the dean of students at Sam Babitt, the dean of students at Vanderbilt

31:19.760 --> 31:20.760
University.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.760
Yes.

31:21.760 --> 31:25.160
Well, we're proud of the part that Tennessee is playing and has played.

31:25.160 --> 31:28.200
Now tell us just what does the peace core do?

31:28.200 --> 31:29.200
What is your plan?

31:29.200 --> 31:30.200
What is your program?

31:30.200 --> 31:31.200
What is your success then?

31:31.200 --> 31:32.200
Yes.

31:32.200 --> 31:36.400
Well, the peace core today is operating in 12 different foreign countries.

31:36.400 --> 31:41.440
Right now we're concentrating in the area of education, in health, in agriculture, and

31:41.440 --> 31:46.480
in the various skilled crafts such as the Carpenters, Laborers, Plumbers, etc.

31:46.480 --> 31:50.640
For the most part, so far, we've concentrated in the education area.

31:50.640 --> 31:55.000
And I include in that all kinds of education, primary education, high school, university

31:55.000 --> 31:59.040
education, agricultural education, home economics, and so on.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.680
It doesn't all just take place in a classroom.

32:01.680 --> 32:05.400
And a person to qualify does not have to be a teacher in the sense that they have a teaching

32:05.400 --> 32:07.280
certificate here in our country.

32:07.280 --> 32:13.440
We've taken a great many bachelor's of arts or bachelor's of science, graduates of good

32:13.440 --> 32:18.200
colleges in our country, and made them into very effective teachers in Africa and South

32:18.200 --> 32:19.600
America and over in Asia.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.640
Well, how are they getting along, Sergeant?

32:21.640 --> 32:24.360
Well, they're getting along wonderfully well so far.

32:24.360 --> 32:29.560
The best indication, Senator, of their success is the fact that every one of the countries

32:29.560 --> 32:34.960
where the peace core is now operating has asked us to double or triple or even quadruple

32:34.960 --> 32:37.960
the number of peace core volunteers in those countries.

32:37.960 --> 32:38.960
Not necessarily.

32:38.960 --> 32:39.960
It's a recommendation now.

32:39.960 --> 32:44.640
Do you go into countries unless they ask you to and unless they welcome you and unless

32:44.640 --> 32:46.280
they cooperate with you?

32:46.280 --> 32:47.280
No, we don't.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.960
We insist in fact that we be invited before we go.

32:50.960 --> 32:55.000
And in a cost-conscious country like ours, I think it's interesting that every one of

32:55.000 --> 33:01.720
the nations has already voluntarily contributed money and services and other goods to the

33:01.720 --> 33:03.320
peace core.

33:03.320 --> 33:07.240
Without us even asking them for it, for example, one country has supplied all the housing.

33:07.240 --> 33:11.640
A large part of the public transportation around in the country that we have to use has

33:11.640 --> 33:13.200
been given to us.

33:13.200 --> 33:17.760
Other forms of equipment, one country in South America has provided almost a million

33:17.760 --> 33:21.920
dollars worth of their equipment to us voluntarily.

33:21.920 --> 33:28.640
Well, I guess, of course, some of these are developing nations and living conditions

33:28.640 --> 33:31.080
might not be very any too pleasant.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.080
They may have many hardships.

33:33.080 --> 33:37.040
Do you have any complaints from the people in the peace core?

33:37.040 --> 33:39.200
Well, we've been lucky so far.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.320
The people who volunteer for the peace core in the first instance are very well motivated,

33:43.320 --> 33:45.560
a highly motivated individuals.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.400
And they know before they go overseas that there are going to be problems and difficulties.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.800
But so far we've been lucky.

33:50.800 --> 33:54.840
For example, in the area of disease, many people thought that there would be a lot of accidents

33:54.840 --> 33:57.600
or disease in many of these countries.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.880
The United States Public Health Service is responsible for the health of the peace core volunteers.

34:01.880 --> 34:07.920
They have told us that they, the public health service, has been surprised at the small

34:07.920 --> 34:10.720
amount of disease which has afflicted the peace core so far.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.840
We're very lucky that one.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.560
How many do you have in the peace core at the present time in massage?

34:15.560 --> 34:22.960
Well, it's changing almost hourly as we make this telecast senator between Thursday of

34:22.960 --> 34:28.440
this week and Monday of next week, 333 new volunteers will go into training with the

34:28.440 --> 34:29.600
peace core.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.800
So as of today, we have about 700 overseas.

34:32.800 --> 34:37.880
We have 200 in training and over this weekend we'll put another 300 in training.

34:37.880 --> 34:41.040
So if you add all that up, it comes with about 1200 people.

34:41.040 --> 34:45.240
And I heard you say somewhere the other day that only less than a half a dozen had asked

34:45.240 --> 34:46.240
to come home.

34:46.240 --> 34:47.240
Is that correct?

34:47.240 --> 34:48.240
That's right.

34:48.240 --> 34:51.280
We've brought four home from overseas.

34:51.280 --> 34:57.480
One was what we call compassionate case because this boy's father died and they get a large

34:57.480 --> 34:58.480
number of brothers and sisters.

34:58.480 --> 35:01.240
His mother needed him back to help support the family.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.440
Another one was the famous postal card girl from Nigeria.

35:04.440 --> 35:07.640
The girl wrote the postal card and creates such a ruckus at that time.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.280
Yes, she was a very fine girl, too.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.280
I'm sure.

35:10.280 --> 35:14.840
She was a magnum, a comalaud graduate of Smith College incidentally.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.880
She had been trained at Harvard and she's still working for the peace core.

35:17.880 --> 35:22.040
I'm happy to say she's in our Washington headquarters and in June, I think it is going to be

35:22.040 --> 35:24.960
married and perhaps you'll be able to continue to work for it.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.440
When I say you have a lot of volunteers, it doesn't mean that anyone who volunteers can

35:28.440 --> 35:29.440
get in does it?

35:29.440 --> 35:30.440
It does.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.440
No, it doesn't.

35:31.440 --> 35:35.440
So we're getting new volunteers now at the rate of 2000 a month.

35:35.440 --> 35:39.880
So we expect that between January and June, for example, about 12,000 people will volunteer

35:39.880 --> 35:41.160
for the peace core.

35:41.160 --> 35:44.280
We probably won't take more than 3,000 of those.

35:44.280 --> 35:49.320
So about one out of every four or one out of every five applicants gets in.

35:49.320 --> 35:54.520
Are they mostly college graduates or young people or what kind of people are?

35:54.520 --> 35:57.200
About 80% are college graduates now.

35:57.200 --> 36:01.320
But we hope that many more people who do not have a college degree will volunteer for

36:01.320 --> 36:03.000
the peace core.

36:03.000 --> 36:09.440
Countries overseas need skilled craftsmen, construction people, automacanics, diesel engineers, nurses,

36:09.440 --> 36:13.720
job laboratory technicians, practical nurses and so on.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.600
And many of these people don't have college degrees.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.640
They don't need to have a college degree.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.760
What's more, they don't have to speak the language.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.760
We teach them the language.

36:20.760 --> 36:24.880
I'll go ask you what kind of training do they have before they go and say they're going

36:24.880 --> 36:30.520
to some nation and Africa, South America, Asia, what kind of training do they have?

36:30.520 --> 36:37.600
Well, they get, I think, a really rare type of training in that we give training in the

36:37.600 --> 36:41.240
culture, customs and traditions of the foreign country to which they're going.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.400
We train in the language.

36:42.400 --> 36:46.000
We teach them about American history and government and politics.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.440
We give them physical education.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.240
We give them health education.

36:49.240 --> 36:53.200
So that when they arrive in the foreign country, they arrive there knowing the history and

36:53.200 --> 36:54.360
the culture of that country.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.320
They know the language of the country.

36:56.320 --> 37:00.120
And the job that they're going to do in that country has already been selected for

37:00.120 --> 37:01.120
them.

37:01.120 --> 37:05.360
They know what kind of work they're going to do and they've been prepared to do that work.

37:05.360 --> 37:09.480
So I started so often in connection with our diplomats and it may not be justified.

37:09.480 --> 37:14.560
There's a complaint that they live to themselves and they have big capitals of the city of

37:14.560 --> 37:17.080
the countries they go to.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.600
How about the members of the Peace Corps?

37:18.600 --> 37:23.320
Did they get out and mix and live with the people and get to know them and work with

37:23.320 --> 37:24.320
them directly?

37:24.320 --> 37:28.880
Well, Senator, that is one of the basic requirements of the Peace Corps, namely that our personnel

37:28.880 --> 37:34.920
live with the natives or the citizens of the foreign country that they're living in.

37:34.920 --> 37:41.880
But I'd say 85% of all Peace Corps volunteers live outside of the capital cities.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.520
The only ones who live in a capital city are people who are teaching, for example, in

37:45.520 --> 37:47.960
a big university in the capital city.

37:47.960 --> 37:52.200
In Bangkok, the big university, as you all know, is called Kula Long Court University.

37:52.200 --> 37:55.440
We have 10 men on the faculty of that university.

37:55.440 --> 38:00.000
So they do live in Bangkok, but most, by far, the great majority, maybe 80 to 90% of our

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
people live in the rural communities of various countries.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
Of course, ours, the Peace Corps has only been going for just a few months, but from

38:08.000 --> 38:13.080
people coming from countries where Peace Corps has been operating, it seems to me that it's

38:13.080 --> 38:18.600
already paying great dividends, but it's been your experience of what's your report.

38:18.600 --> 38:22.980
Well, we agree that some of the most encouraging things have been articles written on the Peace

38:22.980 --> 38:28.520
Corps by foreign journalists and by foreign celebrities, even like Arnold Toyne, be the famous

38:28.520 --> 38:32.800
British historian, voluntarily wrote an article for the London Times, which was printed

38:32.800 --> 38:38.040
all over the world, commending the Peace Corps and telling about the volunteers that he had

38:38.040 --> 38:39.040
seen.

38:39.040 --> 38:44.560
The Associated Press, the United Press, the British news gathering agency called Reuters.

38:44.560 --> 38:48.760
All of these people have interviewed the Peace Corps and have talked to experts about the

38:48.760 --> 38:50.320
Peace Corps in foreign countries.

38:50.320 --> 38:55.520
We have no way of controlling what they publish or say, and uniformly so far, the reports

38:55.520 --> 39:02.240
by these nonpartisan third party groups have been favorable to our operations.

39:02.240 --> 39:06.440
I know that the Peace Corps goes to a lot of neutral countries and a lot of newly developing

39:06.440 --> 39:07.440
countries.

39:07.440 --> 39:12.520
On stand you have a number of Peace Corps people in the Philippines, which is a friendly

39:12.520 --> 39:13.520
nation.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.960
Why would you send Peace Corps representatives to a friendly nation?

39:16.960 --> 39:22.120
Well, maybe I'm all fashion, but I believe in making better friends of the friends you

39:22.120 --> 39:23.120
already have.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.920
I agree with you very thoroughly.

39:24.920 --> 39:29.840
There are things to be sort of a tendency in some quarters to think that you only do business

39:29.840 --> 39:34.760
with people that you might lose, that the neutral nations, the so-called neutral nations,

39:34.760 --> 39:36.720
are the ones that you should curry favor with.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.800
Well, I'm in favor of working with the neutral nations.

39:39.800 --> 39:43.920
We have people in Ghana and other neutral nations, but still in all, I think that when a country

39:43.920 --> 39:49.280
has proven its friendship for us, they're trying to follow the democratic free way of life

39:49.280 --> 39:52.040
and to have trade with us and so on, that we should try to help them too.

39:52.040 --> 39:56.280
And the Philippines is an outstanding example and the Pacific of this type of favorable

39:56.280 --> 39:57.800
country, favorable to ours.

39:57.800 --> 40:03.240
I heard you say where they had 45 different languages or dialects and that they're all

40:03.240 --> 40:04.240
being told English.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.240
Is that so?

40:05.240 --> 40:06.240
Yeah, that's true.

40:06.240 --> 40:10.280
Because in the Philippines, one of the essential ingredients for keeping those islands

40:10.280 --> 40:14.600
together as a nation is that they have a common language and the only language they have

40:14.600 --> 40:16.440
in common now is English.

40:16.440 --> 40:20.880
Also, we've often heard and talked about the fact that Philippines should be a symbol

40:20.880 --> 40:23.320
in the far east of democracy at work.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.960
But we forget sometimes that the only way that the Philippines can communicate with the

40:26.960 --> 40:29.880
rest of the Asia, a rest of Asia, is in English.

40:29.880 --> 40:33.120
If they don't know English, they can't talk to the people who live in Thailand or even

40:33.120 --> 40:34.120
up in Formosa.

40:34.120 --> 40:36.120
So, English is essential as well.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.920
And it's been wonderfully accepted in the Philippines, is that not true?

40:38.920 --> 40:39.920
Yes, that's true.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.840
Well, what are the communists there, that peace corps?

40:41.840 --> 40:43.320
What's their reaction?

40:43.320 --> 40:49.680
Well, it just happens that yesterday I got a new publication issued and printed in China.

40:49.680 --> 40:54.120
It has mailed, say, Tongs picture on the cover and it's distributed all over the world.

40:54.120 --> 40:57.840
This particular copy happened to be picked up in Africa and it was a long article in

40:57.840 --> 41:03.160
there blasting the Peace Corps saying that we were a tool of imperialist aggression, that

41:03.160 --> 41:07.200
we were a nest of spies, that we were out to subvert the people's liberties all over

41:07.200 --> 41:08.200
the world.

41:08.200 --> 41:12.400
And it was indicative to us at any rate that the communists don't like the Peace Corps.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.800
Now, if they don't like the Peace Corps, I'm pleased.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.400
That's a good sign you're doing a lot of good.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.520
Well, how much is the Peace Corps costing this year, for instance?

41:20.520 --> 41:25.280
Well, the Congress gave us $30 million as senators, you remember, and that will be enough

41:25.280 --> 41:29.960
to operate us through the first year and to bring about 5,000 Americans into Peace Corps

41:29.960 --> 41:30.960
service.

41:30.960 --> 41:35.920
Right now, we're asking for another $30 million in addition to the first one to bring

41:35.920 --> 41:38.120
in an additional 5,000 people.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.560
And we've been very much encouraged because the committees here on the Hill have supported

41:41.560 --> 41:43.080
our requests so far.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.800
Liberals as well as reactionaries.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.720
Well, I wish we could go on, but that's all the time we have.

41:47.720 --> 41:52.800
I want to thank you for Sergeant Striver for telling us all about the Peace Corps.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.800
That's all until next time, ladies and gentlemen.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.600
Thank you very much.
