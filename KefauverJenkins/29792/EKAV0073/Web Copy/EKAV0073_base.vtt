WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.600
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we have a very distinguished guest with us today

00:13.600 --> 00:19.400
about whom you have heard much, and I know that all of you admire him as I do.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.240
During the time that I have served on the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and

00:23.240 --> 00:29.440
on the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, I've gotten to know and to hear a great

00:29.440 --> 00:30.440
deal.

00:30.440 --> 00:37.360
A test, I know this man well and I hear his ideas about space and research and the air

00:37.360 --> 00:39.720
command of our great nation.

00:39.720 --> 00:45.800
I guess today is General Bernard A. Sriever, who is head of the Air Force Systems Command.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.400
We'd like to have you with us, Jan. B. Heter.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.800
Let me say by way of an introduction to General Sriever, who was born in Berman Germany

00:53.800 --> 01:00.660
that he immigrated to the United States in 1917, grew up in Texas by a graduated from

01:00.660 --> 01:01.660
Texas A&M.

01:01.660 --> 01:07.860
He served seven campaigns with the 19th bomber group in the Southwest Pacific in World War

01:07.860 --> 01:08.860
Two.

01:08.860 --> 01:16.400
And through a series of top advancements and assignments, he is now the commander of the

01:16.400 --> 01:21.400
Vital Research and Development Program of our Air Force.

01:21.400 --> 01:27.000
General Sriever, tell us just what is the Air Force Systems Command and what does it

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
do?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.840
Well, let's say very large organization.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.200
We have some 75,000 people.

01:33.200 --> 01:39.280
We're responsible for all of the research and development in the Air Force and specifically

01:39.280 --> 01:44.360
the development of weapons systems such as the Atlas, the Titan, the Minuteman, the

01:44.360 --> 01:48.760
RS-70, all the space work that the Air Force does.

01:48.760 --> 01:54.700
And our total budget runs in the neighborhood of $7.5 billion a year so you can see we

01:54.700 --> 01:56.560
have a very large job to do.

01:56.560 --> 02:03.080
The RS-70 will be even more than 80's time goes on, but $7.5 billion a year is a lot of

02:03.080 --> 02:04.080
money.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.600
Otherwise, you have some missiles and rockets here.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.400
These are things, developments that are under your command.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.400
Yes, sir.

02:12.400 --> 02:20.400
I might just, this is the X-15, which of course is an experimental aircraft that you've seen

02:20.400 --> 02:22.840
so much about in the press in the last year.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.200
What have you been in miles an hour?

02:24.200 --> 02:34.680
Well, that has gone at speeds of about 4,000 miles an hour and at altitudes of 250,000

02:34.680 --> 02:36.360
feet.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.760
We work, actually NASA works with us on this program.

02:39.760 --> 02:46.360
This is the latest long range ICBM called the Titan II.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.840
This is also used as the booster.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.800
We'll be used as the booster for our dinosaur program in the Air Force.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.400
It's also the booster for the NASA Gemini program.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.400
Is that the latest man in space program?

02:58.400 --> 03:02.640
And it will be the booster year for our sending a man to the moon.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.640
No, sir.

03:03.640 --> 03:09.440
It will not be the booster for the man in the moon program, but it will provide NASA with

03:09.440 --> 03:13.200
a great deal of information that they need in their lunar program.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.240
So it ties in directly with the lunar program.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.840
The fact of us here is, of course, the Atlas.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.240
This is our first ICBM, which is operational now.

03:22.240 --> 03:27.040
Well, you mean we know what you mean by an ICBM, but just to have a whole other ICBM

03:27.040 --> 03:28.040
do.

03:28.040 --> 03:34.800
Firstly, we consider 5,500 miles as the ICBM range, but the Atlas has capabilities

03:34.800 --> 03:37.000
or considerably an excess of that.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.760
We've fired them ranges up to 9,000 miles.

03:40.760 --> 03:45.040
And your accuracy and hitting response has been very phenomenal, I understand.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.960
Much better than we had hoped for in back in 1954.

03:48.960 --> 03:54.320
I can't give the exact accuracy for security reasons, but it's been very, very good.

03:54.320 --> 03:59.760
And then when we start sending up space communication satellites, which many of us were interested

03:59.760 --> 04:08.640
into, get news and voice and television and communications to all parts of the world.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.720
One of these may be used to put the communication satellite into orbit.

04:12.720 --> 04:17.080
No matter the fact that the boosters that were developed by the Air Force are being used

04:17.080 --> 04:20.680
for that purpose, the floor, I don't have a model here, will be used.

04:20.680 --> 04:25.280
The Atlas has been one of our leading space boosters that's been the boosters to use for

04:25.280 --> 04:26.280
the mercury, for example.

04:26.280 --> 04:30.680
It also has planned to be used for these communication satellites.

04:30.680 --> 04:39.560
General Schlafer sometimes back representatives from the Telehoma Aero, Arnold Engineering

04:39.560 --> 04:48.120
Development Center, and Congressman Evans, Senator Gore, representatives of the State

04:48.120 --> 04:54.560
of Tennessee, and the University of Tennessee, and had a meeting with you and other people

04:54.560 --> 04:59.640
from the Air Force that you're in Washington about a very important project in connection

04:59.640 --> 05:05.760
with the Arnold Engineering Development Center of Telehoma.

05:05.760 --> 05:11.560
I want to ask you about that in a minute, but first tell us the importance of this very

05:11.560 --> 05:13.720
important installation of Telehoma.

05:14.720 --> 05:21.960
Well, I'd be glad to because it's been one of my favorite facilities after the war actually

05:21.960 --> 05:26.200
planning wise, it came under my office in the Pentagon.

05:26.200 --> 05:35.720
And it has really grown up to be what we consider in the Air Force.

05:35.720 --> 05:44.040
The major facility that we have that we can provide tests on the ground for space vehicles.

05:44.040 --> 05:48.880
Every major program that we've had in the Air Force, every ballistic missile program,

05:48.880 --> 05:54.880
every rocket program, every space program, we have run very important tests in the towns

05:54.880 --> 05:59.080
that Telehoma at the Arnold Engineering Center.

05:59.080 --> 06:04.640
This same thing holds true for many of the NASA programs as well as the Navy's Polaris,

06:04.640 --> 06:05.640
for example.

06:05.640 --> 06:14.360
So the contribution that the Arnold Center has made to our missile and space programs has

06:14.360 --> 06:17.200
been very, very great indeed.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.480
Well, we're not proud of it.

06:19.480 --> 06:26.040
Aero is recorded in Tennessee, and as I got it, these tests of all of the missiles and

06:26.040 --> 06:31.800
rockets and everything that has to do about space at the Arnold Engineering Development

06:31.800 --> 06:38.800
Center gives you factual information about what their activity will be when they're

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
actually employed.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
That's correct.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.400
I can give you one quick example.

06:43.400 --> 06:48.560
We were having a great deal of difficulty in our discoverer program in the recovery of

06:48.560 --> 06:50.280
the capsule from outer space.

06:50.280 --> 06:54.760
I think you remember that, and we got a lot of publicity in the paper.

06:54.760 --> 07:00.320
We actually by conducting wind tunnel tests at Telehoma discovered what was wrong with

07:01.320 --> 07:05.280
the parachute coming out in its reentry.

07:05.280 --> 07:11.080
We corrected that, and we've had no more difficulty with that part of the program ever since.

07:11.080 --> 07:16.920
Here's just one example of the payoffs that we have gotten and testing at Telehoma.

07:16.920 --> 07:21.840
Well, we know that this time has been going on, that the importance of Telehoma through

07:21.840 --> 07:29.320
our Air Force, to our space effort has been growing and growing and expanding.

07:29.320 --> 07:34.040
Here's the future of the Arnold Engineering Development Center, where it will continue

07:34.040 --> 07:38.320
to be an even more important part of our space effort.

07:38.320 --> 07:42.880
Well, I don't think there's any question, but that it will be.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.640
We are just really scratching the surface in space.

07:46.640 --> 07:53.040
We have tremendous plans for the center.

07:53.040 --> 07:59.320
We are now putting in what we call a test configuration of an environmental test facility

07:59.320 --> 08:00.320
at Telehoma.

08:00.320 --> 08:05.920
We hope to move on to a very large scale space environmental test facility.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.160
We have the power there.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.400
We have the resources in the way of trained people.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.440
It's an ideal place for it.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.720
It's in the planning phases now.

08:15.720 --> 08:22.920
In addition, we're planning with your good people in Tennessee, the University of Tennessee

08:22.920 --> 08:23.920
and the University of Tennessee.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.920
Yes, that's what I wanted to ask you to talk about something.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.920
It's a great importance to all of Tennessee.

08:29.920 --> 08:34.920
We're talking now about the Tennessee Space Institute.

08:34.920 --> 08:35.920
That's right.

08:35.920 --> 08:37.920
I'll tell us about it.

08:37.920 --> 08:45.600
Well, let's...we, of course, in the Air Force feel that the technological explosion that

08:45.600 --> 08:51.600
the world has experienced in the past 10 or 15 years and which will continue.

08:51.600 --> 08:59.560
The education will perhaps be the crucial factor in our technological struggle and struggle

08:59.560 --> 09:03.120
as a whole with communism.

09:03.120 --> 09:12.440
We need to particularly develop greater capabilities in this country for advanced graduate work.

09:12.440 --> 09:19.080
The Institute is...in the planning stages now, I have several documents here that indicate

09:19.080 --> 09:24.640
that we've been very active in this planning and it's to be...the plan is to locate it,

09:24.640 --> 09:31.440
adjacent two facilities at the Arnold Center and it would be operated under the University

09:31.440 --> 09:33.920
of Tennessee as a graduate institute.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.800
I think it's a wonderful idea.

09:35.800 --> 09:41.560
We've gotten tremendous enthusiasm and support from the people in Tennessee so far.

09:41.560 --> 09:46.440
I believe that the present time there is a request for the acquisition of some 400 acres

09:46.440 --> 09:51.520
of land for the buildings and laboratories and whatnot.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.680
That is true and this will be located to the right adjacent to the lake there.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.160
It's a beautiful location.

09:58.160 --> 10:05.920
I was out the center just about a month ago and it's a wonderful spot for a school and

10:05.920 --> 10:10.640
with the facilities of the center being available to the school, it can really be one of our

10:10.640 --> 10:12.640
leading research centers in the country.

10:13.200 --> 10:20.160
In addition to what the students for, masters or doctors degrees, where they're learning

10:20.160 --> 10:25.640
in the classroom, they have practical application and can have practical experience in the center

10:25.640 --> 10:26.640
itself.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.640
That's right.

10:27.640 --> 10:32.920
That's the beauty of it and that's what makes it unique and I think that we can well

10:32.920 --> 10:33.920
lead the way here.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.520
As Arnold Srieber's, I understand it and we've had several discussions about it.

10:38.520 --> 10:45.120
The importance is to be a joint effort on the part of the state of Tennessee, the University

10:45.120 --> 10:50.160
of Tennessee and as we all know Dr. Holt and the president of the University and his

10:50.160 --> 10:54.960
people are very interested in cooperative design.

10:54.960 --> 11:04.560
As we all know, the Air Force and NASA and Navy and other federal agencies, that's

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
right.

11:05.560 --> 11:13.280
The center is, whereas it's operated by the Air Force, we not only welcome, but we look

11:13.280 --> 11:21.840
for work that we can do and support of the Navy, NASA and the Army and we do support them

11:21.840 --> 11:26.480
a great deal now and we'll certainly continue to do so because we look at it as a national

11:26.480 --> 11:27.480
resource.

11:27.480 --> 11:33.480
And you need men educated in the field that would receive their instruction.

11:33.480 --> 11:40.240
There it is, Arnold Engineering Development Center Institute, or Tennessee Space Institute

11:40.240 --> 11:42.240
that we're going to call it.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.240
Right.

11:43.240 --> 11:48.080
We've had several different names but the latest is the, I've got a variety of Tennessee

11:48.080 --> 11:50.080
Space Institute.

11:50.080 --> 11:54.720
General Srieber, how soon do you envision with everybody cooperating fully that this

11:54.720 --> 12:01.360
can become a reality because it's a great and unique development to understand?

12:01.360 --> 12:10.240
Well, I think that we could certainly get started in, go beyond the planning and start

12:10.240 --> 12:12.480
implementing and doing another words.

12:12.480 --> 12:20.240
Within the next 12 months, and I would say that if everything is pushed the way it should

12:20.240 --> 12:26.640
in my opinion, we could certainly get students there within a matter of a year or two, even

12:26.640 --> 12:33.040
before we have all the facilities and file forms.

12:33.040 --> 12:38.080
The attitude and the desires there so we can get started, I think, real soon.

12:38.080 --> 12:45.640
Now, I understand that the Arnold Engineering Development Center has been allocating some

12:45.640 --> 12:53.040
of its funds already out of its own pocket for the purpose of getting least planning.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.240
Yes, in the next, in the planning.

12:55.240 --> 13:01.240
Yes, sir, our people are very enthusiastic about this and what we call the military side

13:01.240 --> 13:02.840
and arrow have been working on.

13:02.840 --> 13:06.960
Is there any institute of this kind in the United States at the present time, or is this

13:06.960 --> 13:08.960
unique, or is it not unique?

13:08.960 --> 13:14.680
This would be the first institute of this kind that I know anything about and I'm sure

13:14.680 --> 13:19.840
I'm correct, so it would be unique, but I'm sure that more would follow.

13:19.840 --> 13:25.680
And you'll give masters and doctors degrees to the students there and they could.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.680
Yes, sir, that's right.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.680
Study for them.

13:28.680 --> 13:33.120
Well, once you know our General Srever, I'm sure you do already that we in Tennessee are

13:33.120 --> 13:39.640
very interested in this project and everybody is anxious to cooperate with you and with

13:39.640 --> 13:43.800
NASA and we hope it becomes a reality in the near future.

13:43.800 --> 13:49.080
And on behalf of the listeners over this station, I want to thank you very much for being

13:49.080 --> 13:50.080
with us today.

13:50.080 --> 14:09.440
That's all until next time.

14:09.440 --> 14:15.120
Ladies and gentlemen and friends of Tennessee, this is the first of monthly television programs

14:15.120 --> 14:21.840
that I will endeavor to bring you during this session of the Congress of the United States.

14:21.840 --> 14:27.960
I want to thank this station for carrying these programs as a public service and thank

14:27.960 --> 14:30.440
you for your interest in them.

14:30.440 --> 14:36.880
We will endeavor to have with us distinguished leaders in government from time to time and

14:36.880 --> 14:41.760
we will appreciate any suggestions that you might make as to the subject matters to be

14:41.760 --> 14:44.080
covered in the various programs.

14:44.080 --> 14:49.240
Approximately, at the end of January, we will have another program on what happens in the

14:49.240 --> 14:53.600
first part of this Congress and then at the end of each month thereafter.

14:53.600 --> 14:58.960
And again, I want to thank this station and its ownership and managers and all of you

14:58.960 --> 15:03.800
for your help in making these programs successful.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.880
Today is the beginning of this session of the Congress.

15:07.880 --> 15:13.360
The House of Representatives met on yesterday and elected John McCormick as Speaker of

15:13.360 --> 15:19.440
the House, Carl Albert from Oklahoma as the majority leader.

15:19.440 --> 15:25.480
Today we also had our caucus and on the Senate side, which was very harmonious.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.640
The program for the session was discussed.

15:28.640 --> 15:37.760
And I think we will have a very good democratic unity and working together on the Senate side.

15:37.760 --> 15:45.360
It's our great honor today to have one of the leaders of the House of Representatives

15:45.360 --> 15:50.760
with us on this program who is well known to people in Tennessee.

15:50.760 --> 15:54.960
He is Congressman Hale Boggs from the State of Louisiana.

15:54.960 --> 15:59.600
He distinguished Congressman who's leadership in the House of Representatives has been

15:59.600 --> 16:03.520
pronounced for many, many years.

16:03.520 --> 16:10.040
Before calling on Hale, I want to say that he came to the House of Representatives about

16:10.040 --> 16:17.560
a two years after Senator Gore and I, he first came in 1941.

16:17.560 --> 16:23.600
He served in the United States Navy as an officer to time out to be in the Navy.

16:23.600 --> 16:28.520
And later to almost get elected as Governor of the State of Louisiana.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.680
He is the new whip of the House of Representatives.

16:32.680 --> 16:36.520
And it's good to see you have you, whether it's Congressman Hale Boggs.

16:36.520 --> 16:43.360
After such a pleasure to meet with you, our friendship goes back for many years.

16:43.360 --> 16:49.960
And I might say to the people of Tennessee that knowing you has been a great inspiration

16:49.960 --> 16:50.960
to me.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.120
I've been to Tennessee many times.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.880
This thing and campaigning.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.760
Yeah, I want to talk about some of those times.

16:56.760 --> 17:01.800
Every time we ask you to come down for some democratic occasion, you're always very willing

17:01.800 --> 17:02.800
to do so.

17:02.800 --> 17:07.240
I remember one time you came down to Nashville to our big democratic meeting.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.160
Hale, maybe an outstanding speech.

17:10.160 --> 17:15.680
When you were a nice, our number of particularly gone to Knoxville in 1956 when we had a round

17:15.680 --> 17:20.880
up there when you were a candidate for Vice President of the United States.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.680
Yeah, we had had at least Stevenson with us on that day.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.680
Yeah, yeah.

17:24.680 --> 17:28.240
Well, I'd like to see a lot of the country and we enjoyed our travels around.

17:28.240 --> 17:32.280
We weren't too successful, but it was a great experience anyway.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.680
Well, needless to say, yes, this is a pleasure for me to go to Tennessee.

17:36.680 --> 17:42.760
My last trip there was with Speaker Avin and Charlotte before he had to leave here.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.760
You remember?

17:43.760 --> 17:48.520
Just the dedication in July of the bridge up to the North City on the Tennessee River.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.920
We were down to Speaker Rayburn and you were very wonderful to come.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.800
That was his last trip to Tennessee.

17:54.800 --> 18:00.000
I think that he got more pleasure out of that trip than anything that's happened to him

18:00.000 --> 18:04.760
in a long time because you remember Hale, his relatives on both sides of the river all

18:04.760 --> 18:06.760
came to see him.

18:06.760 --> 18:11.280
Well, I went fishing with him, asked his son a little like there and he reminisced about

18:11.280 --> 18:12.960
his childhood in Tennessee.

18:12.960 --> 18:18.440
So what you and the governor and the other people in Tennessee did for him that day I think

18:18.440 --> 18:20.440
was really magnificent.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.080
And I believe you called a lot of fish too, did we show it to you?

18:23.080 --> 18:27.520
I remember when you came back, you forgot to wrap up my package for him.

18:27.520 --> 18:32.200
Well, Hale, you just been elected as the whip of the House of Representatives.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.800
Have you got a whip with you?

18:33.800 --> 18:34.800
Not a lot.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.800
I got a lot.

18:35.800 --> 18:42.240
Lastly, third in command, the Speaker of course of the House is Mr. McCormick, Massachusetts.

18:42.240 --> 18:48.520
Old and good friend of ours and Carl Albert is the majority leader in the year of the next

18:48.520 --> 18:51.120
in the rank as the whip.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.960
What is the, what are the duties of the whip?

18:52.960 --> 18:54.600
Of course, Percy Priest was the...

18:54.600 --> 19:00.080
Joe, wonderful, Congressman Percy Priest was whip for quite a long time.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.480
Well, what do you do?

19:01.480 --> 19:03.480
Well, the whip has several functions.

19:03.480 --> 19:07.040
He's a assistant majority leader to begin with.

19:07.040 --> 19:14.640
This means that he has responsibility with the leader for the programming the House.

19:14.640 --> 19:21.000
In addition to that, he's the man that's relied upon to give the temper of the House.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.720
We have assistant whips who check each member on the Democratic side to ascertain his feelings

19:27.720 --> 19:29.880
and see whether they're going to go to the right or not.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.000
I know it right or wrong.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.240
And this is quite helpful.

19:35.240 --> 19:39.560
We know at least to some extent how we stand on legislation.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.560
It's not an easy job.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.560
It's a rough job.

19:42.560 --> 19:47.240
A lot of them don't like to say how they stand on legislation as you will know.

19:47.240 --> 19:51.560
Yeah, and then you have to get all the Democratic members there to keep your left of the

19:51.560 --> 19:52.560
vote.

19:52.560 --> 19:58.520
And the House, as you recall, many of the most important votes don't occur by way of

19:58.520 --> 19:59.520
a roll call.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.760
They have a teller and standing votes.

20:02.760 --> 20:08.240
And if our numbers are not there, we can lose without even knowing we're losing.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.240
That's right.

20:09.240 --> 20:15.560
Well, during the last few days you've had several visits to the White House with the

20:15.560 --> 20:21.560
leadership of the Democratic Party and with the bipartisan leadership to get briefings

20:21.560 --> 20:27.040
on the state of the Union and state of our defenses and on the legislative program.

20:27.040 --> 20:32.480
Would you tell us about your visits with the President and his advisors?

20:32.480 --> 20:41.240
Well, it's very difficult to talk about the legislative program without coming to just

20:41.240 --> 20:47.000
one committee in the Congress in this session.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
Most of the legislation that we are confronted with involves taxes or variations of taxes

20:53.000 --> 20:57.400
like tariffs, social security.

20:57.400 --> 21:03.160
And all of these under the Constitution must originate in the House representatives, specifically

21:03.160 --> 21:05.480
in the Committee on Ways and Means.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.800
And on yesterday, the President added another one which also goes to the Ways and Means Committee,

21:09.800 --> 21:12.760
named for the problem of debt limitation.

21:12.760 --> 21:18.720
So that all of the discussions have sent it almost primarily upon the House Ways and Means

21:18.720 --> 21:20.920
Committee in this program.

21:20.920 --> 21:26.200
And upon the Side Finance Committee, which is the Companion Committee and the Side,

21:26.200 --> 21:32.700
the legislative matters as you know involve taxes and I don't give them necessarily in

21:32.700 --> 21:38.040
priority or rather a comprehensive tax revision program.

21:38.040 --> 21:45.240
The President is rightly interested in stimulating more investment in American enterprises.

21:45.240 --> 21:50.200
You know there's been some conversation about this administration being at risk of business.

21:50.360 --> 21:56.160
Here I know, in my opinion nothing could be further from the truth.

21:56.160 --> 22:02.320
The President recognizes a vital connection between the prosperity and the function of

22:02.320 --> 22:03.320
the government.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.720
As a matter of fact, as you know from your own studies, a difference of employment of a

22:07.720 --> 22:13.120
million people means a difference in revenues of about three and a half billion dollars.

22:13.120 --> 22:18.600
So that if employment drops off by a million, our revenues decrease by three and a half billion

22:18.680 --> 22:24.920
dollars or if employment increases by a million, revenues increase by three and a half billion

22:24.920 --> 22:25.920
dollars.

22:25.920 --> 22:31.480
So one of the main concerns of the press and any economic advisors has been this business

22:31.480 --> 22:33.880
of unemployment.

22:33.880 --> 22:40.040
Despite the fact that business particularly in the third and fourth quarters of 1961,

22:40.040 --> 22:48.400
was at boom proportions, we still were running a rate of unemployment of over five percent,

22:48.400 --> 22:50.400
which is way too high.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.200
This brings us to consideration of the tax program.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.000
Now let's talk a little more about the tax program.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.440
There is a recommendation that certain loopholes be closed such as excessive expense accounts

23:02.440 --> 23:07.240
and things of that sort with the safe treasury, a lot of money.

23:07.240 --> 23:13.760
And then the President recognizes that businesses got to employ more people, produce more

23:13.760 --> 23:20.600
and compete with more competitive markets such as the common market in Europe so that

23:20.600 --> 23:23.120
there is a program for an investment incentive.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.120
Just what is that?

23:24.120 --> 23:29.080
And I think it has merit, but you know more about it tonight.

23:29.080 --> 23:36.320
Well this program would permit business establishments, both large and small, to obtain

23:36.320 --> 23:43.320
a tax credit of up to eight percent of the funds that they used to for expanding their

23:43.320 --> 23:47.080
plant equipment or improving their plant.

23:47.080 --> 23:51.320
Now as you pointed out, Senator, this is important for a variety of reasons.

23:51.320 --> 23:54.680
Number one, to increase the jobs in the United States.

23:54.680 --> 24:00.520
And number two, to put us in a competitive position with the common market to countries,

24:00.520 --> 24:05.800
which incidentally is probably the second item of consideration on the President's

24:05.800 --> 24:06.800
program.

24:06.800 --> 24:11.160
Now the tax program of course is for the Ways and Means Committee of which you have

24:11.160 --> 24:13.160
seen your member.

24:13.160 --> 24:18.280
And then the giving the President broader powers and connections with tariffs to negotiate

24:18.280 --> 24:24.360
so that we can make arrangements with the common market of Europe is the other matter

24:24.360 --> 24:26.600
we were going to discuss.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.600
Yes.

24:27.600 --> 24:31.960
I want to say in connection with the common market of Europe that of course I was in Paris

24:31.960 --> 24:36.880
this fall, as you know as a member of the NATO parliamentarians conference and you were

24:36.880 --> 24:41.560
there also, that it has become a reality.

24:41.560 --> 24:50.240
There are lowering tariff barriers, restrictions on trade, talking about their common currency.

24:50.240 --> 24:56.520
Europe is important to us because we have a favorable trade balance there.

24:56.520 --> 25:00.760
Also, if we don't trade with them, we can't work together militarily and politically.

25:00.760 --> 25:06.480
So I think from every viewpoint, our own personal opinion is we must work out and give the

25:06.480 --> 25:12.880
President some leeway and negotiating with the common market.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.920
That will be a very controversial issue before the Congress.

25:15.920 --> 25:19.920
How do you feel about it and how do you think it's going to go and whether the reason for

25:19.920 --> 25:22.160
us getting into this here?

25:22.160 --> 25:26.240
Well, that's just number one.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.720
I should like to point out and I'm sure all the people of Tennessee know this.

25:30.720 --> 25:37.680
That you probably have made the greatest contribution of any American towards the unification

25:37.680 --> 25:39.840
of Europe which is now a reality.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.320
I know that for many, many years you wake towards this goal.

25:43.320 --> 25:46.080
From my late-Ladigrins and friends, I have a little appreciation for it.

25:46.080 --> 25:54.320
Now, to my way of thinking this is really one of the significant events of this century

25:54.320 --> 25:56.560
for a great variety of reasons.

25:56.560 --> 26:03.840
Number one, it presents the greatest problem that the communists have faced.

26:03.840 --> 26:08.920
They have operated on a theory, as you know, that the West was deconent, that Europe would

26:08.920 --> 26:14.120
decline fast and finally we would be isolated and we too would fall.

26:14.120 --> 26:21.920
Now with the vitality of Europe growing in a rate exceeding 8% of gross national products,

26:21.920 --> 26:23.720
it's an absolute enigma to them.

26:23.720 --> 26:29.040
It applies all of the communist dogma so that politically this is the greatest thing

26:29.040 --> 26:33.640
that's happened to us as a nation, to the whole West, to the whole West, non-communist

26:33.640 --> 26:34.640
world.

26:34.640 --> 26:39.640
But on economic point of view, this is a vital type of competition that we're faced

26:39.640 --> 26:45.440
with, both in agricultural commodities and in manufactured articles, so that if our

26:45.440 --> 26:50.440
government doesn't have the authority, the power to negotiate with the common market

26:50.440 --> 26:56.560
and operate more or less in the partnership arrangement, we could become great rivals.

26:56.560 --> 27:01.800
And if that happened, then the Soviets would have succeeded in driving a wedge between us,

27:01.800 --> 27:07.000
which would be a very dangerous thing for the West, so that what the President is really

27:07.000 --> 27:14.400
saying is that the common market is something very vital to us politically and militarily

27:14.400 --> 27:16.080
and economically.

27:16.080 --> 27:20.800
But we, on the other hand, must recognize the fact that it's also a challenge.

27:20.800 --> 27:26.120
Therefore, he says to us, as members of Congress, give me the power to negotiate realistically

27:26.120 --> 27:27.120
with these people.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.920
I think when the American people understand this, they will give the President that thought.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.240
Well, that's a good summer up.

27:32.240 --> 27:37.520
And hey, old week, you could go on here and talk about many things for a long, long time,

27:37.520 --> 27:40.080
but our time is up, and I hope we can have you back with us.

27:40.080 --> 27:46.320
I want to thank you very much for cheering on these stations today.

27:46.320 --> 27:51.120
And I wish you the very best luck as the new whip of the Democrats in the House of Representatives.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.120
Thank you, son.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.120
That's all for now.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.120
Thank you.

27:54.120 --> 28:09.680
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, today we have the distinct pleasure and

28:09.680 --> 28:16.280
honor of having with us as our guest, one of the most important men in the government

28:16.280 --> 28:23.360
of the United States, a man who's been known to you for his excellent coverage of news

28:23.360 --> 28:31.720
and his objective treatment of news concerning domestic and world affairs over Columbia Broadcasting

28:31.720 --> 28:35.280
Company for many years.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.400
He's an old and good friend of mine.

28:38.400 --> 28:42.640
Everett or Murrow, the head of the United States Information Agency, he had a certain

28:42.640 --> 28:44.640
he is good to have you with us.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.720
And very pleasant to be with you again, son.

28:46.720 --> 28:55.080
I know that many viewers of this program will remember the great enjoyment and benefit

28:55.080 --> 29:00.600
they got out of watching and seeing and hearing you over a period of many years when you

29:00.600 --> 29:02.880
would with Columbia Broadcasting Company.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.840
Well, I find what I'm doing now much more fascinating and I think more important than

29:06.840 --> 29:08.360
anything I've done before.

29:08.360 --> 29:16.200
Ed, exactly what is the United States Information Agency that you had a...

29:16.200 --> 29:22.400
Well, as you know, it's an independent agency reporting directly to the president.

29:22.400 --> 29:30.560
Secures its budget appropriations from the Congress as a budget this year of $111.5 million.

29:30.560 --> 29:35.440
Its purpose, I would define briefly and I know that you like brevity on these programs.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.720
I know everybody is very much interested in it.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.480
I think it's terribly important.

29:40.480 --> 29:46.920
I would define its purpose briefly as being to make United States policy everywhere intelligible

29:46.920 --> 29:50.120
and wherever possible, palatable.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.440
We do not operate inside this country.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.160
We operate the voiceless America.

29:55.160 --> 29:59.360
You only operate here when you make a mistake and it's when you hear a lot about it.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.680
Yes, we receive publicity when we make it to state.

30:01.680 --> 30:06.720
All the good things that you do, 99 and 9 tens per cent of the time, you don't hear much

30:06.720 --> 30:07.720
about in the United States.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.720
That's the thing.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.880
When you fall on your face, you...that's true.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.880
That's true.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.240
Congress and the people are all over you.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.240
Our work begins at the Water's Edge.

30:15.240 --> 30:20.160
We operate the voice of America in a shortwave radio operation.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.320
We have a television service, a film program.

30:23.320 --> 30:27.120
We operate libraries in 99 countries abroad.

30:27.120 --> 30:32.480
We operate a wireless file which sends from this country to our missions abroad about 10,000

30:32.480 --> 30:38.080
word each day, made up largely of official statements, background material.

30:38.080 --> 30:42.880
The sort of thing that is of use to our embassies and our representatives abroad.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.880
We publish pamphlets.

30:43.880 --> 30:52.280
We engage in a program to produce cheap books in translation in Latin America, in Africa,

30:52.280 --> 30:54.480
in Southeast Asia.

30:54.480 --> 31:00.080
We have a cultural officer stationed abroad who handle the foreign end of exchange programs,

31:00.080 --> 31:03.720
collecting students to come to this country on fellowships.

31:03.720 --> 31:10.960
Also arranging the leader grants, that is a program under which we bring to this country,

31:10.960 --> 31:16.200
young editors, professors, that sort of thing, who, when they return to their own country,

31:16.200 --> 31:19.200
will be able to explain what this country is about.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.240
Its purpose is its institutions.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.400
That in essence is the U.S.I.

31:24.120 --> 31:27.360
Well, since you have been the head of the U.S.I.

31:27.360 --> 31:35.600
and I may say also during the previous administration, I had an opportunity of being in some cities

31:35.600 --> 31:38.880
in foreign countries, friendly countries.

31:38.880 --> 31:44.240
And I had the impression that the pamphlets and the books are giving the truth about

31:44.240 --> 31:50.000
the United States, what we stand for and what we are trying to do, where much appreciated

31:50.000 --> 31:55.120
by the people, particularly the young people in those nations, and that this was doing

31:55.120 --> 32:01.960
more than most anything I saw to build good relations with the people in those countries.

32:01.960 --> 32:10.560
How do you feel the program is far as libraries and information is coming along?

32:10.560 --> 32:19.440
Well, in the new countries, particularly in Africa, Southeast Asia, the hunger for something

32:19.440 --> 32:25.440
to read, the desire for knowledge, the curiosity about this country.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.680
I failed to mention earlier that we also teach English.

32:27.680 --> 32:31.120
We will be teaching English this year to about a quarter of a million people in Mexico City

32:31.120 --> 32:32.120
alone.

32:32.120 --> 32:36.040
7,500 people go to our English classes each day.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.040
That's what I mean.

32:37.040 --> 32:41.480
And to sit and see people, and I've seen them from Latin America to Nigeria in the course

32:41.480 --> 32:46.240
of the last year, to see them sitting around at night in adult education classes, reading

32:46.240 --> 32:50.960
and discussing the writings of Tom Paine, or in Nigeria just a couple of weeks ago, the

32:50.960 --> 32:52.960
Federalist Papers.

32:52.960 --> 32:57.760
This is a very exciting thing because these people are trying to hammer out their own destiny,

32:57.760 --> 33:02.000
and they're looking about, for example, for newer legions.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
As I said, it's the most exciting thing I've ever tried to do.

33:05.000 --> 33:11.240
I've been impressed, Ed, that under you, the USI is not what we would call it propaganda

33:11.240 --> 33:12.240
agency.

33:12.880 --> 33:19.040
All you do is to try to give people in other countries a true and factual and objective

33:19.040 --> 33:23.320
picture of what we're doing here.

33:23.320 --> 33:29.360
Of course that's in addition to the teaching programs, in addition to the student exchange

33:29.360 --> 33:31.800
programs and things of that sort.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.320
That is the way you operate it isn't it?

33:34.320 --> 33:39.200
It is indeed, and I am convinced that we have no alternative.

33:39.200 --> 33:45.520
We must tell the truth because everything we say in an open society is subject to comparison.

33:45.520 --> 33:51.080
And the material that is sent out of here, films, television, the wire agencies and so

33:51.080 --> 33:53.520
forth, all of that is available to people abroad.

33:53.520 --> 33:58.040
And therefore, if we must tell the truth whether we want to or not, and I happen to think

33:58.040 --> 34:00.960
that it is the only method by which we can proceed.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.120
Well, I certainly agree with you.

34:03.120 --> 34:09.000
Now, what programs does the US Information Agency carry on behind the iron curtain

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
and the Soviet block, if any?

34:13.000 --> 34:20.040
Primarily, it is short-wave broadcasting through the voice of America.

34:20.040 --> 34:25.480
However, we will have had this year in the Soviet Union, traveling exhibits, having to

34:25.480 --> 34:31.520
do one with plastics, the whole plastics industry, the products that we produce, another with

34:31.520 --> 34:34.480
transportation, the whole development of transportation here.

34:34.480 --> 34:38.760
And one is leaving at the end of this month having to do with medicine.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.320
And the curiosity, I seem to have some knowledge of drugs.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.800
Yes.

34:45.800 --> 34:53.440
The curiosity on the part of the Soviet people about this country is really very impressive.

34:53.440 --> 34:57.360
Many of the questions that our guides get, we send along with these exhibits about 20

34:57.360 --> 35:00.000
Americans who speak Russian fluently.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.240
And the Russians who come through at the rate of anywhere from 10 to 15,000 a day are asking

35:04.240 --> 35:09.240
questions not only about the exhibit, but about the United States and how we live.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.840
And they come up to a guide and say, how much did that suit cost you?

35:11.840 --> 35:15.960
How long did you have to work in order to buy it and so forth?

35:15.960 --> 35:21.920
And this is one of the most effective methods we have of communicating with people in the

35:21.920 --> 35:22.920
Soviet Union.

35:22.920 --> 35:28.120
How I think it is effective, but of course your effectiveness is somewhat limited by the

35:28.120 --> 35:31.760
extent that they will let you take the exhibits around.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.760
That is true.

35:32.760 --> 35:39.400
We also print in the Soviet Union a magazine, an ARCA illustrated, which has a circulation

35:39.400 --> 35:41.520
of 52,000.

35:41.520 --> 35:46.480
It would of course skyrocket, but we are limited to the 52,000 by agreement with the Soviet

35:46.480 --> 35:47.480
Union.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.880
They print a similar magazine in this country.

35:49.880 --> 35:54.560
But in terms of effectiveness, Senator, you might be interested to know that a few months

35:54.560 --> 36:01.200
ago in our broadcast to Yugoslavia, we ran a little contest to give away a few transistor

36:01.200 --> 36:02.200
radio receivers.

36:02.480 --> 36:07.000
And we made a few announcements over a period of one week and we received better than

36:07.000 --> 36:09.120
18,000 letters from Yugoslavia.

36:09.120 --> 36:17.760
And then you do our programs in satellite nations such as Czechoslovakia, Poland.

36:17.760 --> 36:22.440
We operate the voice of America operates in 36 languages.

36:22.440 --> 36:27.640
We estimate our audience to be roughly 20 million, however, in addition to the shortwave

36:27.640 --> 36:29.200
broadcast.

36:29.200 --> 36:33.840
We undertake what is called a package programming that is we do tapes and records here and

36:33.840 --> 36:37.200
supply them to local medium wave stations.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.840
And there of course is where you get the audience.

36:39.840 --> 36:45.440
And we reckon our audience there to be in the area of 45 million people.

36:45.440 --> 36:51.560
I believe that on the 24th of this month, everywhere, the voice of America will have its

36:51.560 --> 36:52.560
20th anniversary.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.360
Is that correct?

36:54.360 --> 36:57.000
We think we're achieving majority now.

36:57.000 --> 37:03.640
Well, I think it's one of the most valuable programs about learning about this country,

37:03.640 --> 37:08.680
both inside and outside the iron, iron curtain countries.

37:08.680 --> 37:12.640
And one of the great, you know, sensitive and important places in the world today is

37:12.640 --> 37:19.280
of course the newly developing nations of Africa.

37:19.280 --> 37:25.680
And our success or our failure there is going to have a great bearing upon the future

37:25.680 --> 37:27.440
of the world.

37:27.440 --> 37:32.240
You have, I believe, just recently returned from a two or three week visit to Africa, have

37:32.240 --> 37:33.240
you not?

37:33.240 --> 37:34.240
Yes, I did.

37:34.240 --> 37:40.240
But tell us how do you think our foreign policy and our programs are getting along enough?

37:40.240 --> 37:46.160
Well, I think we are doing moderately well, but I came back from three weeks all of it

37:46.160 --> 37:53.720
in West Africa, by the way, with a feeling that there is so much to do and so little time

37:53.720 --> 37:54.800
in which to do it.

37:54.800 --> 38:03.720
I have never encountered such a combination of candor, curiosity and suspicion.

38:03.720 --> 38:08.640
Suspicion of us, suspicion of the Russian, suspicion of each other.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.640
But there is all along that coast of West Africa in these new countries.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.640
What kind of a determination?

38:13.640 --> 38:20.640
Well, I started at Dakar and then went down the coast to Leopoldville.

38:20.640 --> 38:27.240
And it was this determination to explode into the second half of the 20th century.

38:27.240 --> 38:38.160
Now an appetite to read, for example, in Africa, south of the Sahara, there are probably, although

38:38.160 --> 38:40.320
no one has exact figures on this.

38:40.320 --> 38:45.120
Probably one copy of one newspaper for each 1000 people.

38:45.120 --> 38:52.240
The channels of communication traditionally ran north and south, that is, to Paris, to

38:52.240 --> 38:56.920
London or to Brussels during the colonial period.

38:56.920 --> 39:05.840
So there is now this appetite to learn, I think, someday a perceptive historian is going

39:05.840 --> 39:11.360
to conclude that the development of the transistor radio was one of the most important events

39:11.360 --> 39:16.760
in this century because it means that it is now possible to communicate by radio with

39:16.760 --> 39:23.040
people who are electric, who have no power supply, who have no money economy.

39:23.040 --> 39:27.880
I found, for example, in Guinea and Ghana, two areas that have been heavily penetrated

39:27.880 --> 39:35.200
by the Soviet Union, that there is developing a certain disillusionment with the Soviet Union

39:35.200 --> 39:40.920
because the Russians, historically in any part of the world, are miserable expatriates.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.320
They don't like living outside the Soviet Union.

39:43.320 --> 39:44.480
They don't like the climate.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.800
They drive their cars too fast.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.720
They soak up the good housing.

39:49.720 --> 39:53.720
They tend to treat the local citizens with a degree of content.

39:53.720 --> 40:00.600
I came back with the feeling that in West Africa, nothing is lost, that we are always to

40:00.600 --> 40:06.920
remind ourselves that communism has not taken over outside the shadow of Russian tanks

40:06.920 --> 40:07.920
or bayonets.

40:08.400 --> 40:12.720
And that while these people are shopping around in the vernacular playing both sides of

40:12.720 --> 40:21.040
the street, that still our revolutionary tradition, our feeling that we share their aspirations

40:21.040 --> 40:22.040
and their desires.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.960
There are very powerful influences in the whole area.

40:24.960 --> 40:31.520
And I want to say that I think it's the USIA and your intelligent work of the various

40:31.520 --> 40:37.800
parts of this agency is doing more than any other activity of the government, ensuring

40:37.800 --> 40:42.200
that we have a true picture of freedom and liberty and what we are trying to do.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.680
Senator, what we mean to them?

40:43.680 --> 40:49.480
When it comes time for us to ask for our appropriations this year, I shall come back and remind you

40:49.480 --> 40:52.360
of that and hope you will use your influence with your colleagues.

40:52.360 --> 40:59.240
Well, I think you've always appreciated the fact that I think particularly under you

40:59.240 --> 41:03.120
this agency is doing a tremendously good job.

41:03.120 --> 41:09.360
I think what we need more of is to let people in other countries know about the real

41:09.360 --> 41:10.360
United States.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.360
You're doing that.

41:12.360 --> 41:17.560
Do you feel on the whole very briefly that we are succeeding, that we are getting ahead

41:17.560 --> 41:20.040
in our effort in Africa?

41:20.040 --> 41:23.080
I think we are making very considerable progress.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.920
And I say there is so much to do.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.640
I think there are going to be new constellations of power, perhaps new collisions in Africa.

41:30.640 --> 41:34.280
I had the feeling as a matter of fact at the end of this trip in Africa that maybe

41:34.280 --> 41:38.240
Mr. Dooley was right when he said anybody who isn't confused doesn't understand what's

41:38.240 --> 41:39.240
going on.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.240
Well, thank you very much, Ed Morrow.

41:41.240 --> 41:46.500
And I know friends all of you have enjoyed having Ed Morrow with us today as I have, we

41:46.500 --> 41:49.880
wish you well in your very important efforts there.

41:49.880 --> 41:50.880
Thank you, Senator.

41:50.880 --> 41:51.880
That's all for now.

41:51.880 --> 41:51.880
