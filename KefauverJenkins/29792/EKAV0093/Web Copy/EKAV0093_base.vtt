WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.080
My name is Quincy Howe.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.960
My job is to report and comment on the news for ABC, radio and television.

00:26.960 --> 00:33.180
My assignment here in Miami is to discuss the campaign issues with Estes Keapover and

00:33.180 --> 00:36.520
Adley Stevenson, who are our chief performers this evening.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.480
Now there's no need to introduce the two top contenders, the Democratic presidential

00:40.480 --> 00:41.480
nomination.

00:41.480 --> 00:47.960
And I can let them define as well as discuss the issues, but just a brief word on the

00:47.960 --> 00:50.480
background I think is in order.

00:50.480 --> 00:56.520
Mr. Sanitak Keapover got off to a strong start in his primary race by winning Minnesota,

00:56.520 --> 01:00.360
Governor Stevenson came back strong in our gun last week.

01:00.360 --> 01:05.000
A week from tomorrow, they go before the voters of Florida, the registered voters here

01:05.000 --> 01:10.400
in the primaries here, the week after that, another big primary in California.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.200
So those primaries on top of the our gun won are just about bringing this primary phase

01:15.200 --> 01:20.480
of the convention of the race for the presidential nomination and the Democratic party to the

01:20.480 --> 01:25.640
climates, which makes this evening the time in Miami the place for these friendly rivals

01:25.640 --> 01:28.840
to discuss the issues of the campaign.

01:28.840 --> 01:34.120
I'm very deeply honored to find myself here as moderator and I'm also intensely nervous

01:34.120 --> 01:37.760
because of the triple responsibility that lies upon me.

01:37.760 --> 01:43.240
First is Senator Keapover, second to Governor Stevenson, and third to those who look and

01:43.240 --> 01:44.240
listen in.

01:44.240 --> 01:49.760
I must see that the time is fairly divided, that I state the issues as impartially as it

01:49.760 --> 01:54.240
is humanly possible for me to do, and that there is a full and very discussion of the

01:54.240 --> 01:55.240
issues.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.760
And then there's an agreement on the format that's going to be a three minute opening statement

01:58.760 --> 02:01.760
from each of the two gentlemen here in a five minute closing.

02:01.760 --> 02:07.560
A toss of the coin decided that Senator Keapover would open, then Governor Stevenson, then

02:07.560 --> 02:13.040
at the close, Governor Stevenson first and Senator Keapover closes up the whole thing.

02:13.040 --> 02:18.160
In between there'll be freewheeling talk in which I act as a kind of a traffic cop with

02:18.160 --> 02:22.560
power to hand out parking tickets if anyone stays too long in one place or to enforce speed

02:22.560 --> 02:24.440
limits if they get going too fast.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.440
And I hope there won't be any occasion to do either.

02:27.440 --> 02:32.560
So first Senator Keapover, and if any of you want to know what he is going to talk about,

02:32.560 --> 02:36.880
the answer is about three minutes and I hope it won't be too much more.

02:36.880 --> 02:42.200
Thank you very much, Mr. Howard, Governor Stevenson, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

02:42.200 --> 02:47.920
A presidential campaign must not degenerate into a mere personal conflict.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.280
For candidates are only as important as the ideas they represent.

02:52.920 --> 02:58.120
Now therefore welcome this opportunity for this discussion with Mr. Stevenson.

02:58.120 --> 03:04.200
Overshadowing all else is this morning's news of the first dropping from an American

03:04.200 --> 03:07.200
airplane of an H bomb.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.760
There can be no mistaking effect that we are now face to face with a double-edged possibility

03:12.760 --> 03:18.360
of total destruction and the possession of total destructive power.

03:18.360 --> 03:24.400
We are perhaps being dominated by the very instrumentalities which we ourselves have created.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.600
And unless we can forge some readjustment of our organization and management of political

03:29.600 --> 03:37.200
affairs, we shall never again live unafraid and undominated by these fearful prospects.

03:37.200 --> 03:42.040
Unless we can successfully grapple with this, we shall never again be free in the sense

03:42.040 --> 03:46.720
that we can make our own choices and live in confidence.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.520
Next we must have a moral, atomic energy policy.

03:50.520 --> 03:57.520
Second we must continue to experiment and test and develop new and extended uses of nuclear

03:57.520 --> 03:58.720
energy.

03:58.720 --> 04:04.920
We should however take the lead in proposing to the Soviet Union that we have an immediate

04:04.920 --> 04:10.240
cessation of further dropping of A in H bombs when they show that they are willing to act

04:10.240 --> 04:12.400
in good faith.

04:12.400 --> 04:17.680
Without the protection of such an agreement, we ourselves have little choice but to continue

04:17.680 --> 04:20.320
in the interest of our own security.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.920
Our favorite, the so-called Baruch Plan when it was first presented.

04:24.920 --> 04:29.680
Substantially that plan with emphasis on inspections should now be resubmitted.

04:29.680 --> 04:35.760
I think the very dropping of this new bomb may give new hope of success in achieving such

04:35.760 --> 04:37.440
agreements.

04:37.440 --> 04:42.680
Substantialists, Belman everywhere, must realize that we cannot leave this destructive force

04:42.680 --> 04:45.440
loose in the world uncurred.

04:45.440 --> 04:50.440
We need a crash program to ensure that the nation is producing scientists, both highly

04:50.440 --> 04:56.320
qualified and insufficient numbers, second to none in the world.

04:56.320 --> 05:02.600
The national interest demands a truly non-political and independent, atomic energy commission.

05:02.600 --> 05:07.920
We need a nationwide program to turn the benefits of atomic energy to peaceful uses in

05:07.920 --> 05:08.920
our economy.

05:08.920 --> 05:14.680
Our favorite government-sponsored program for the establishment of atomic federal projects

05:14.680 --> 05:17.400
in the key areas throughout the country.

05:17.400 --> 05:22.120
We must ensure that there is no private monotony in atomic energy.

05:22.120 --> 05:28.680
Finally, we must find means of transforming this machine of total destruction into an instrument

05:28.680 --> 05:30.600
for lasting peace.

05:30.600 --> 05:36.280
We must turn its very terrible into the last best argument for world peace.

05:36.280 --> 05:40.520
We cannot continue along a path, past hope and fear.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.240
Perfect timing, Senator Kepler.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.840
And now Governor Stevenson, the offering minutes.

05:45.840 --> 05:53.000
Mr. Howe, you said something about the root, what's the basis, what's the principle

05:53.000 --> 05:57.120
subject of the principle concern of our country in this campaign?

05:57.120 --> 06:00.560
I think perhaps the senators touched upon it as I see it.

06:00.560 --> 06:05.720
Certainly the solemnity of the time in which we live was best illustrated yesterday by

06:05.720 --> 06:09.480
the dropping of the H-bomb in the far Pacific.

06:09.480 --> 06:19.280
A bomb five times or more, more powerful than all of the explosive detonated by the United

06:19.280 --> 06:21.800
States in the last war.

06:21.800 --> 06:30.560
I thought when I read of this, not only that the future is either going to be a future

06:30.560 --> 06:37.080
of creativity and of great abundance, or it's going to be a future of total incineration,

06:37.080 --> 06:43.440
death and destruction, and that the United States may have to lead the way which direction

06:43.440 --> 06:45.320
we're going to take.

06:45.320 --> 06:51.280
I thought of the remark of the interesting phrase that President Sikarno of Indonesia used

06:51.280 --> 06:55.080
for the spoke to the Congress the other day in which he said that he had come to the United

06:55.080 --> 06:56.560
States.

06:56.560 --> 07:03.240
Not just to see the great United States, not just to learn something about this center of

07:03.240 --> 07:08.280
geography and of the balanced power in the world and the center of gravity, but because

07:08.280 --> 07:13.320
he wanted to come here because it was the center of an idea.

07:13.320 --> 07:18.520
It's this idea that I think is the at the heart of this campaign.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.680
What is America about?

07:19.680 --> 07:24.920
What does it mean in this midpoint of the 20th century when these great revolutions of

07:24.920 --> 07:30.000
technology that have developed this bomb which have made all men neighbors, when the great

07:30.000 --> 07:36.120
revolution of independence which has swept over Asia, the great revolution, the great

07:36.120 --> 07:42.600
ideological revolution which threatens us from the East communism have all converged.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.160
This I think is what we have to demonstrate and quickly.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.480
We are great, but we are few.

07:47.480 --> 07:52.520
We have 50% of the world's manufacturers, but only 6% of the world's population.

07:52.520 --> 07:58.440
We have to import 50% of our raw materials.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.240
The balance with our allies, we constitute what?

08:01.240 --> 08:05.640
But 15% of the world, the enemy constitutes 35%.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.640
Together we 50%.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
What's the rest?

08:09.640 --> 08:12.440
The rest is the great uncommitted peoples of the earth.

08:12.440 --> 08:16.440
These are the peoples that we're going to contest for as long ideas as many of us are

08:16.440 --> 08:17.440
living.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.160
We're here witnessing this program tonight.

08:20.160 --> 08:25.720
And it's until the United States assumes once more leadership in this world, leadership

08:25.720 --> 08:31.040
in the direction of peace on earth until we once more can assert the moral influence that

08:31.040 --> 08:32.920
we have enjoyed in the past.

08:32.920 --> 08:38.520
It's three years ago we were both great and we were also we commanded confidence and we

08:38.520 --> 08:39.600
were respected.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.800
We were strong and we were respected.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.720
We're not as strong today as we are that we're then nor are we as respected.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.080
We have to recover on both scores.

08:48.080 --> 08:53.160
Now I should very be very glad as the evening goes on here to talk a little about the H-bomb.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.440
I've made some proposals with respect to that myself.

08:56.440 --> 09:01.840
But I know that most of all, Mr. Howell that the what's at the center of this campaign

09:01.840 --> 09:06.840
in my judgment is the assumption once more of leadership in the world in the direction

09:06.840 --> 09:12.080
of the peace that has become the prayer of all mankind and most of all of our people in

09:12.080 --> 09:13.080
this country.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.080
Thank you, Governor Stevenson.

09:14.080 --> 09:18.720
And I think since we've gotten into this foreign policy and bomb subject, let's stay

09:18.720 --> 09:19.720
with it.

09:19.720 --> 09:25.800
Senator Kiefover made a remark in his talk suggesting that perhaps we should cut down on these

09:25.800 --> 09:26.800
H-bomb tests.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.120
How about getting a little more practical?

09:29.120 --> 09:32.920
What precise steps would you suggest taking from here on out, Senator?

09:32.920 --> 09:33.920
What should we do?

09:33.920 --> 09:34.920
These would be the rules.

09:34.920 --> 09:42.480
Well, Mr. Howell, the matter that I said forth was that while we've always wanted

09:42.480 --> 09:47.360
and we're anxious now to reach some agreement, we've referenced to the control of atomic

09:47.360 --> 09:53.880
energy and for its use for key-stamp purposes for the welfare of our people, the thing is

09:53.880 --> 10:00.040
that it's inconsistent to criticize the administration and to complain that we're not keeping up or

10:00.040 --> 10:04.880
that we're not ahead of the Soviet Union in the making of guided missiles and atomic

10:04.880 --> 10:06.200
energy.

10:06.200 --> 10:11.920
And at the same time not be willing until we can get some good faith agreement from them,

10:11.920 --> 10:19.880
not be willing to experiment and to explode or to use the bombs that we make because only

10:19.880 --> 10:26.040
by experimenting with them can we keep ahead so that I do not think we can propose acting

10:26.040 --> 10:32.720
unilaterally and stopping the dropping of atomic bombs as I understand my friend, Governor

10:32.720 --> 10:34.720
Stevenson has proposed.

10:34.720 --> 10:39.200
Do you want to go along on that line, Governor Stevenson, you've come out in opposition

10:39.200 --> 10:40.200
to the H-bomb test?

10:40.200 --> 10:43.560
Well, sir, I have said this.

10:43.560 --> 10:49.640
I have said that I've pointed out that the Soviet Union has recently told us in London

10:49.640 --> 10:55.520
that the open sky's proposal of inspection by aviation by air was fantastic, where the

10:55.520 --> 10:57.080
words that Mr. Kruchef used.

10:57.080 --> 11:02.040
It's apparent that we're making no progress nor have we in the past ten years towards

11:02.040 --> 11:05.640
the step-by-step disarmament program.

11:05.640 --> 11:11.320
Now with respect to the H-bomb, the H-bomb cannot be tested without all the world knowing

11:11.320 --> 11:12.800
it.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.800
This is my understanding.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.720
I believe this is the case.

11:15.720 --> 11:21.000
If that's so, it has the advantage of not requiring inspection to know whether or not

11:21.000 --> 11:26.080
the enemy is complying with an agreement or is not complying with an agreement.

11:26.080 --> 11:30.120
It has its own built-in security factor.

11:30.120 --> 11:35.520
The Soviet Union has, unhappily, and I think it's one of the great ironies of our time.

11:35.520 --> 11:40.280
It's now succeeded in masquerading as the friend of these uncommitted peoples is half of

11:40.280 --> 11:45.160
the world that I mentioned, which is where rests the balance of power in the world and

11:45.160 --> 11:47.120
where rests I think are destiny.

11:47.120 --> 11:51.880
I think it's imperative that the United States takes some leadership towards recapturing

11:51.880 --> 11:53.280
the confidence of these people.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.280
What else should we do?

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
We could do it.

11:55.280 --> 12:00.320
Yeah, because of the built-in factor of security, due to the fact that you cannot test an H-bomb

12:00.320 --> 12:04.480
without it being known everywhere, is that we could unilaterally propose that we would

12:04.480 --> 12:11.040
discontinue testing the H-bomb on condition, of course, that if our enemies did not go along

12:11.040 --> 12:15.400
with this and do the same, we would know about it and we could resume the testing of the

12:15.400 --> 12:16.400
H-bomb.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.200
That this distinguishes this weapon from everything else.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.000
It has no relationship to the guided missile, whatever.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.400
Well, Mr. Howard, I think the difficulty is, though, that it's reputed that the Soviet

12:28.400 --> 12:31.960
have already dropped the H-bomb from an airplane.

12:31.960 --> 12:37.600
Of course, this test in specific, which Governor Stevenson proposed, his iron studage, should

12:37.600 --> 12:43.360
not take place, was for the development of a new use of the weapon.

12:43.360 --> 12:49.600
Now, we can't very well afford to fuss about not keeping up in these weapons and the

12:49.600 --> 12:55.320
in atomic energy if we are unable to experiment with them and to see what they will do.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.800
Now, I certainly agree that we ought to make it very clear to everyone in the world that

12:59.800 --> 13:05.000
we are perfectly willing to devote atomic energy and our research and share it with people

13:05.000 --> 13:06.840
when it can be shared everywhere.

13:06.840 --> 13:14.840
Of course, they, because the war of ideas is important and we are the must be, as we've

13:14.840 --> 13:19.400
always been, the real friends of people who want to develop their resources and get their

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
liberty.

13:20.480 --> 13:26.080
But we cannot afford to allow any other power to have greater strength in atomic energy

13:26.080 --> 13:28.560
and guided missiles than we have.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.760
And I didn't like very much.

13:29.760 --> 13:35.280
Frankly, the statement by Mr. Kruchev when he was in England indicating that the Soviets

13:35.280 --> 13:37.600
were going right ahead with their missile program.

13:38.720 --> 13:43.920
I want to see some good faith before I stop keeping the defenses of the United States strong.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.600
Let's get on to some more of these features of the Russian new look.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.680
This military come back and that kind of thing.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.040
I think that you've made your position.

13:51.040 --> 13:55.840
We got through with a bomb something about what we ought to do with the atomic energy

13:55.840 --> 14:00.560
program and developing it for commercial purposes if we may.

14:00.560 --> 14:05.360
Yes, I'd like very much if I could point out to the senator that the I have never suggested

14:05.360 --> 14:07.680
post-pony development of the missile on the contrary.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.760
I've urged the development of the missile.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.480
This is a weapon that could be tested without anyone knowing it.

14:12.480 --> 14:16.400
It has none of the built-in security features of knowledge and information.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.960
Therefore, when the president said that the missile and the bomb to develop one

14:20.960 --> 14:23.120
with the other was useless, I didn't understand it.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.120
Frankly, no, do I think he understood me?

14:25.760 --> 14:26.960
The missile can be developed.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.240
It should be developed.

14:28.240 --> 14:33.680
Or weapons should be developed so that we can keep pace with our enemies.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.960
Indeed, we must keep ahead of them.

14:35.760 --> 14:40.080
The what I am talking about is the most lethal, the most terrible, the most devastating,

14:40.080 --> 14:43.760
the most ghastly weapon that has been developed on the face of the earth.

14:44.320 --> 14:48.000
We have the power of self-suicide, a destruction of the world.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.360
And I said that this one could be eliminated if they would agree with security,

14:53.360 --> 14:54.960
because we'll know it if they're not.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.160
And what's happening?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.360
If they're not the right amount of time.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.960
He talked about the guided missile.

14:58.960 --> 14:59.440
I see.

14:59.440 --> 14:59.840
Well, sorry.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.440
The guided missile is quite different.

15:01.440 --> 15:08.720
It's the President said it's impossible to develop a missile within a atomic or hydrogen warhead

15:08.720 --> 15:11.440
unless you're going to experiment with it.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.680
I think you must be right in that.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.680
But you wanted to talk about the peacetime uses of this.

15:15.680 --> 15:16.480
Yes, I did.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.680
I think we ought to understand this.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.920
There is no, you can, a missile is nothing but a carrier.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.320
That's right.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.840
It's like an airplane senator.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.360
It's like a railroad train.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.840
It delivers the goods to a target.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.880
Goods can be an atomic warhead.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.080
It can be an conventional TNT warhead.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.640
It could be a hydrogen warhead.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.920
It could be anything.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.120
Now the development of the missile has nothing to do with the content of the explosive in the warhead.

15:46.160 --> 15:51.040
Well, I'd understood the defense department thought that it was necessary to experiment with both of them together.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.120
But the governor may be right on it.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.320
I think that's a misunderstanding.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.480
But in any event, I would like to bring up the question of what's happening to our

15:59.600 --> 16:02.240
atomic energy commercial use program.

16:03.120 --> 16:07.840
Six years ago and three years ago, we were either had a monopoly or we were greatly in the lead.

16:08.080 --> 16:12.080
We were told in the time the atomic energy act of

16:12.880 --> 16:18.320
1954 came up that the government should not even build any demonstration

16:19.040 --> 16:21.840
reactor plants for the purpose of making electricity.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.240
That private industry would do it all.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.960
But we find now after a period of time that not one patent has been issued,

16:29.680 --> 16:34.000
there's been no private development of atomic energy for commercial purposes.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.440
No reactors have been built.

16:36.080 --> 16:42.880
Only $36 worth of electricity has been sold from a submarine prototype plant up in New York.

16:45.040 --> 16:52.800
The mean time the Soviet has been producing atomic energy from our electric power from the

16:52.800 --> 16:55.920
atomic generator since May 1954.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.760
They're building another one.

16:57.760 --> 17:01.920
They expect to have two million kilowatts and salt capacity by 60.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.760
And the British have 22 reactors in the process of being made.

17:07.040 --> 17:11.600
A private industry probably rightfully says it cannot invest the money to assume this

17:11.600 --> 17:14.400
responsibility. They shouldn't have asked for it in the first place.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.040
So I think the times come when our

17:17.920 --> 17:26.400
atomic energy act of 1954 must be revised so that the government can experiment and build

17:26.400 --> 17:29.200
these reactors throughout many parts of the country.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.960
I know the state of Florida has been doing a lot of work trying to get one established here.

17:35.520 --> 17:40.640
Rather do not have power and coal and of course it's in places like that where they should be built.

17:41.440 --> 17:46.640
And we must get the atomic energy commission back to the business of commercial development

17:46.640 --> 17:50.800
and dealing with atoms and out of such matters as Dixon and Yeats.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.760
Well I'd like to get Mr. Steeves and Governor Steeves and others some of the diplomatic features

17:55.920 --> 18:01.520
of this new Soviet look both in connection with the downgrading of Stalin, the military cut back and

18:01.520 --> 18:06.880
so on. There's a great deal of controversy over that. It cuts across party, across national lines.

18:06.880 --> 18:11.440
Are we being too gullible? Tought the Russians, some people say we're too simple minded. Other

18:11.440 --> 18:17.840
people say we aren't tough that we're we should be more kindly and we are too negative and too rigid.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.280
I'd like to hear what you have to say about that. Governor, you've been around the world recently.

18:21.760 --> 18:27.680
How did you find people reacted? Let me say that I should like to say to Senator that I agree with

18:27.680 --> 18:32.240
much of what he has just said. I would point out too that nothing could be more ironic.

18:32.240 --> 18:36.640
Then in the present contest that we're in with the Russians which I will get to which is for the

18:37.600 --> 18:43.920
allegiance of these uncommitted peoples, these neutral peoples and that depends largely on who

18:44.480 --> 18:49.760
is going to how that rapidly they can fulfill the promise of their revolutions, they can improve

18:49.760 --> 18:55.040
their standard living and their well-being, they would be ironic indeed if the Soviet Union

18:55.840 --> 19:01.440
beat the United States to the development of reactors which could be used by for power development

19:01.440 --> 19:07.840
in these power hungry countries who are trying so desperately to to industrialize at long last.

19:08.480 --> 19:14.240
And there I think again what the Senator implied is correct that the public in the United

19:14.320 --> 19:19.760
States have invested somewhat $14 billion in the development of atomic and nuclear energy

19:20.320 --> 19:26.720
and that we should be frustrated and the further development for peaceful purposes to use

19:26.720 --> 19:32.960
abroad as well as here. Yes, and we should ever be outdone by the Soviet Union would be a

19:32.960 --> 19:38.560
sad thing indeed. Now you asked me about the cut in the military forces of the Soviet Union,

19:38.560 --> 19:44.880
they were ground forces. Yes, million two. It was a spectacular propaganda stroke and it's had

19:44.880 --> 19:53.200
undoubtedly widespread effect in Asia as evidence of the peaceful ideas of the peaceful desires of

19:53.200 --> 19:58.240
the Soviet Union. It's another reason why I think that we are going to have to come up with some

19:58.240 --> 20:03.200
ingenious ideas if we're going to compete for their allegiance especially in the direction of peace.

20:03.280 --> 20:08.640
I think that the cut was of no significance because of the change in the character of warfare.

20:08.640 --> 20:14.000
Immediately after the war we had a monopoly of atomic weapons. We also had the means of their

20:14.000 --> 20:20.080
delivery by aircraft superiority. All the Soviet Union could do was develop ground forces to

20:20.080 --> 20:25.680
in order to envelop the continent of Europe if need be to interdict our bases. And so on now that

20:25.680 --> 20:30.880
they likewise have the means of delivery and the weapon itself they can afford to change their

20:30.880 --> 20:37.520
tactics which are their military structure and that they have done. They have done it also because

20:37.520 --> 20:43.520
of its propaganda value also because it will strike a sentimental and sympathetic code in the west

20:43.520 --> 20:50.000
where we all want to cut forces to save money especially in Western Europe and also because of its

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
enormous propaganda value in Asia. Now as a legislator, Senator Keifalba, how do you find your

20:56.000 --> 21:00.560
constituents respond on these issues that we're talking about now? Other votes in these things?

21:01.200 --> 21:06.800
Is there any popular ground swell in favor or against changes in our atomic policy?

21:06.800 --> 21:14.320
Well, I feel and it's very much along the lines the Governor Stevenson has explained that then

21:15.120 --> 21:21.920
the cut in the Soviet ground force indicates that they appreciate the new type of war that we

21:21.920 --> 21:25.680
would have in the future and that probably they're directing more of their attention to it.

21:26.560 --> 21:31.440
And I think that place is a great burden upon us and upon the chiefs of staff and the

21:31.440 --> 21:37.120
national security council and the president to keep up with modern methods of war so that we can

21:38.160 --> 21:44.640
put emphasis on new developments as they come along. The whole nature of war far as the parent

21:44.640 --> 21:51.440
and the change in the last several years. But while it's quite apparent, it's probably true that

21:51.680 --> 21:57.200
the Soviet cut was just for the purpose of transferring their manpower or getting stronger in

21:57.200 --> 22:03.200
planes and atomic energy and cutting down on great mass land armies. I do think we ought to try

22:03.200 --> 22:09.280
to ascertain if they are in good faith, give them an opportunity of showing some acts of good faith

22:09.280 --> 22:16.720
like raising the iron curtain, giving the satellite the Poland and the other, the other satellite

22:16.800 --> 22:22.240
nations an opportunity of having a free vote. I think the lines of communication must always be

22:22.880 --> 22:28.000
kept open so that we can if there's any chance of them being in good faith act ourselves.

22:28.880 --> 22:35.200
But I think we would be very unwise and cruelhearted to create the slasher armed forces

22:35.920 --> 22:40.080
on the just on the basis of what they've done without knowing more about it. And I think we

22:40.080 --> 22:44.560
ought to tell the people of the world just what our position is. Is there any kind of a step we

22:44.640 --> 22:49.920
should take? For instance, there's a discussion now about cracking down on countries that

22:49.920 --> 22:54.640
start trading too much and strategic goods behind the iron curtain with red China. Should we

22:54.640 --> 23:00.400
modify our stand there? How do you gentlemen feel about that? Well, I frankly feel that I was in

23:00.400 --> 23:06.480
Russia this past year and in the satellite nations too. There's still a whole lot of good will

23:06.480 --> 23:11.040
between the average Russian peasant and the American citizen. They're tremendously interested in

23:11.040 --> 23:16.720
what's going on here. I think if freedom comes to the Soviet Union, it will be through the

23:16.720 --> 23:22.800
evolutionary process and probably not through a revolution. I think we would gain a whole lot

23:23.920 --> 23:32.160
of goodwill and we would pressure for liberty would be stronger. If in non-strategic matters,

23:32.160 --> 23:38.560
particularly if we could send missions with them, if we did allow some non-strategic trading,

23:39.440 --> 23:43.600
I think we ought to try to get all the information, all the American influence, the influence of

23:43.600 --> 23:48.480
the west behind the iron curtain that we possibly can. Now, Governor Stevenson, you have been

23:48.480 --> 23:53.200
particularly interested in these uncommitted nations as you call them. What do you think perhaps

23:53.200 --> 23:59.840
our changes should be toward them? The scientist speaks of Russia. How about India, Indonesia?

23:59.840 --> 24:04.720
I think our policy has been as you suggested the moment ago, the word you suggested was negative.

24:04.720 --> 24:10.240
I think our policy for the last three years, instead of being forward-looking, instead of taking

24:10.240 --> 24:16.400
instead of identifying ourselves with the revolution of the rising expectations of these newly

24:16.400 --> 24:23.040
independent nations, our attitude has been one of rigidity, one of mistrust, one of suspicion,

24:23.040 --> 24:30.640
one of always quating everything to what we can get out of it in the sense of military commitments,

24:31.360 --> 24:40.560
and the sense of rejection of the concept of neutralism. This has had, of course, disastrous effects

24:40.560 --> 24:46.320
in the loss of prestige and influence by the United States. We've rested our security largely on

24:46.320 --> 24:55.360
military packs and on military aid. The over emphasis on the military, the rigidity of our attitudes

24:55.360 --> 25:01.520
for the most part, and so much of the dialogue that's conducted in this country has had an

25:01.520 --> 25:05.840
unfortunate effect. Now, I think we should change that, and I'm happy to say that within the very

25:05.840 --> 25:11.280
last few weeks there's been some evidence of a change. The Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles,

25:11.600 --> 25:16.480
has begun to talk a little more sympathetically and understandably about neutralism. After all,

25:16.480 --> 25:21.760
this United States was neutral for 150 years. We ought to know more about it and be more understanding

25:21.760 --> 25:27.280
about it than anyone else. In addition to that, even now we're going to talk a little about

25:27.280 --> 25:34.240
more flexibility with respect to aid. Under emphasizing, I hope, the military. I think these are

25:35.120 --> 25:42.000
in the right direction. I have myself, as you perhaps know, Mr. Howe proposed that we could do a lot

25:42.000 --> 25:48.400
to neutralize the new Soviet challenge in the economic field, which has come upon us if we were to

25:49.040 --> 25:54.000
distribute aid, at least in part, through the United Nations rather than bilaterally.

25:54.640 --> 26:00.480
That until we make use of these methods, which will force the Russians in turn to be responsible,

26:00.480 --> 26:08.160
and to deal multilaterally, we will be always in this auction system of bargaining, and always

26:08.160 --> 26:16.480
under the possibility of blackmail, of the threat, that if you don't do what we want for you,

26:16.480 --> 26:21.120
we'll go communist. I'm going to exercise my authority here as the traffic cop and get us out of

26:21.120 --> 26:25.120
this parking lot, where in many ways, press we should have stayed for the whole time, because

26:25.120 --> 26:30.240
there's certainly no more important issue. I would like to express my views very briefly,

26:30.960 --> 26:38.320
and perhaps specifically on the subject we've been talking about. I agree that we placed too

26:38.320 --> 26:44.000
much reliance on military power. I think more specifically, we've made a mistake in letting

26:44.000 --> 26:49.040
NATO fall apart. We haven't tried to unify it. I do not think we've properly supported the

26:49.040 --> 26:54.240
United Nations until right recently. I do not think we've made clear our obligation in the

26:54.240 --> 27:00.560
Middle East that we will stand by a friend, Israel, even though she may be in a tough situation,

27:00.560 --> 27:06.720
and also try to solve the question of the refugees. I think we've played out, we talked out

27:06.720 --> 27:11.200
of both sides of our mouths on the issue of colonialism, and have lost many of our friends in

27:11.200 --> 27:18.240
Southeastern Asia. I think we have been letting the Soviet leaders act, and we have been reacting,

27:18.240 --> 27:24.640
and I think that we're going to have to again return to our heritage as a nation, that we want to

27:24.640 --> 27:30.080
help nations have the people have the right of self-determination and self-government when they're

27:30.080 --> 27:36.080
capable of having it. Then we will have regained the respect and the admiration and the friendship

27:36.080 --> 27:40.960
of the world when we do that. Well, I'd like to get us now onto this issue that time. Sure,

27:40.960 --> 27:44.720
Looms lodge here in Florida, and a lot of other parts of the country too, and you both know what

27:44.720 --> 27:51.520
that is, segregation. Suppose we start with Governor Stevenson from Illinois, and he has done very

27:51.520 --> 27:57.280
well in the Illinois primary, although he was considered to be a little moderate on some aspects

27:57.280 --> 28:03.360
of the segregation issue, and yet in the Chicago, you've got a very big popular vote. How do you feel,

28:03.360 --> 28:09.760
Governor, about your stand on segregation? Do you feel that you have a stand that is going to

28:09.760 --> 28:16.080
track wild support among colored voters and northern city dwellers in not necessarily being in too

28:16.080 --> 28:23.520
much of a hurry? Well, sir, I think so. I don't know that my stand is novel in any way, shape or form.

28:23.520 --> 28:32.880
I have expressed it on many occasions. I've said that the Supreme Court has expressed, I believe,

28:32.880 --> 28:38.560
the conscience of the nation. It certainly has expressed my in this decision on desegregation.

28:38.560 --> 28:43.600
It is also expressed what I think was inevitable. The progress that we have made towards full

28:44.080 --> 28:49.840
the realization of full and equal rights for our minority groups has been tremendous in the past 20

28:49.840 --> 28:57.120
years. This is another major step forward. The court has told us what must be done, and now the

28:57.120 --> 29:02.800
lower courts are assigned the task of telling us when it must be done. I think the problem remains

29:02.960 --> 29:09.440
as to how it is to be done. It's gratifying to me that one half, I believe, roughly one half of all of the

29:10.240 --> 29:15.360
formerly segregated school districts in the country in two years, and it's only been two years,

29:15.360 --> 29:22.080
are now desegregated. But little by little will come down to the hardcore. The difficult stubborn,

29:22.080 --> 29:26.800
sticky places. These will be the deep southern states. These are major social adjustments.

29:27.440 --> 29:31.600
I've said that these major social adjustments, like all social adjustments, require

29:32.400 --> 29:38.240
are difficult and they require time. They also must be accompanied in this

29:38.240 --> 29:44.320
agent day with the greatest understanding and the greatest cooperation I would hope.

29:44.320 --> 29:49.280
And I had hoped also that the president might have intervened in this matter and seen fit to call

29:49.360 --> 29:56.400
in. The leaders of both races in Washington to see what could be done to ease this over.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.920
This transition is this very major and important adjustment. We have to go ahead with it. It has

30:01.920 --> 30:06.560
to be done. That's the law. But now, Senator Kiefer, I don't imagine you'd perhaps disagree

30:06.560 --> 30:11.280
very much with any of the opinions of Governor Stevenson, but you're from a border state. You did not

30:11.280 --> 30:15.520
sign this southern manifesto, a court decision, a Supreme Court decision that some senators would

30:15.760 --> 30:20.640
clear the south sign. How do you find that this stand that you're taking, which is not too far from

30:20.640 --> 30:25.200
the Governor's defense? And how is that affecting your prospects in the southern part of the country?

30:26.000 --> 30:31.680
Well, sir, the Supreme Court decision came right in the middle of the time I was running for

30:31.680 --> 30:39.520
re-election in 1954 in Tennessee. And I said at that time, as I've said since, that the Supreme

30:39.520 --> 30:44.960
Court decision is the law of the land. And any man who takes the oath as president of the United

30:44.960 --> 30:51.200
States, I said since, must take an oath that he is going to uphold the Supreme Court, the law of

30:51.200 --> 30:57.360
the land and the Constitution. And certainly, I wouldn't think false oath in that respect.

30:58.160 --> 31:02.240
I want to say in the first place that it's not only in the south that we have the scrimminations.

31:03.200 --> 31:09.360
We have the scrimminations of Mexican Americans, Oriental Americans, and many parts of the country,

31:09.360 --> 31:14.720
Spanish Americans, and many part in their discriminations between the races and the north.

31:15.600 --> 31:21.200
So that this matter of an equal, fair, full chance for everybody is a nationwide problem.

31:21.840 --> 31:26.240
But of course, we do have a particular problem in the connection with the integration of the schools.

31:27.200 --> 31:32.480
The Supreme Court has spoken, and that is the law of the land. The Supreme Court, of course,

31:32.480 --> 31:37.840
I recognize that there are, there's going to take patience, that there are different situations

31:37.840 --> 31:43.600
in different communities that will require some special treatment and consideration.

31:44.560 --> 31:51.760
But I want to say as a southerner, and as one who has four bears have lived in the south for a long,

31:51.760 --> 31:57.440
long time, that I know the south is going to stay in the mainstream of this great American life.

31:58.400 --> 32:03.760
We have contributed much. The Supreme Court decision places the primary responsibility

32:03.760 --> 32:09.200
upon the school boards in the south with the federal district courts acting as the referees.

32:10.160 --> 32:16.960
And I know that our people have the intelligence. They have the enough spirit of brotherly love

32:16.960 --> 32:23.360
and wanting to do the right thing. We can work out this problem rightly and justly

32:24.000 --> 32:32.960
without sacrificing our public school system and without violence, without causing difficulties.

32:32.960 --> 32:37.520
I know, and I think, Governor Stevenson and I have both expressed the fact that you,

32:38.080 --> 32:44.160
this is something where you can't use a military coercion. We've got to appeal to the

32:44.160 --> 32:50.000
hearts and minds and to the fairness of people. And I have a very firm conviction that our own people

32:50.000 --> 32:56.080
have the fairness and the ability and the intelligence to handle this problem ourselves.

32:56.640 --> 33:02.320
I do feel as Governor Collins here in Florida has suggested that the president calling a

33:02.320 --> 33:08.480
conference of governors, calling in the school boards. Maybe people representing both races to

33:10.400 --> 33:17.840
first keep it in perspective and to keep it out of the hands of violent people. I could do much to

33:17.840 --> 33:23.600
help solve this matter. But it can be, and I don't think it's going to cause a disruption of our

33:23.600 --> 33:30.080
democratic party because the winds of freedom and the demand to be equal and to have a

33:31.040 --> 33:36.400
right to have, of course, all around the world today. Speaking of the disruption of the democratic

33:36.400 --> 33:42.560
party, that brings up the Texas situation there where Senator Johnson did so well and the new

33:42.560 --> 33:46.400
setup of the primary for the convention. How do you feel about that, Governor Stevenson? Would you

33:46.400 --> 33:52.720
like to comment on that? Well, I was delighted. I think if it was a question of Governor

33:52.720 --> 33:58.640
Schivers or Speaker Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson, I think there couldn't be any question as to

33:58.720 --> 34:02.560
what's best for the democratic party, what's best for Texas, and what's best for the United States.

34:02.560 --> 34:07.680
And that's Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson. I'd like to say too in that connection that I think

34:07.680 --> 34:15.360
the election in Texas where the unhappy race issue again was used. And the election here in

34:15.360 --> 34:21.680
Florida, both of these have been healthy and reassuring straws in the wind. And that anyone who uses

34:21.680 --> 34:28.400
this issue, this all-important issue, should merely deserve political ends, is going to do us

34:28.400 --> 34:34.560
the Union of Grave to service in this election year. I think that in addition to what the

34:34.560 --> 34:41.120
Senator has said that the proper resolution without disorder and violence of this all-important,

34:41.120 --> 34:47.680
perhaps most important, domestic issue of many years is imperative. It's also the fact that we

34:47.680 --> 34:52.800
must demonstrate to the world that we mean what we say, that we practice what we profess,

34:53.360 --> 34:58.160
and that we in this flexible government, that we have in this country, in contrast to the

34:59.920 --> 35:07.360
autocracies, to the tyrannies, that we can settle a question of this kind without silencing the

35:07.360 --> 35:10.960
opposition. Well, I've asked you, gentlemen, quite a number of questions. Out the perhaps some

35:10.960 --> 35:16.320
questions you would like to ask each other, either on subjects that have come up for this evening,

35:16.320 --> 35:21.040
or comments you might care to make on statements that one or other of you may have made earlier in

35:21.040 --> 35:26.560
the campaign, would you like to ask Governor Stevenson a question, Senator Kekeover, and then

35:26.560 --> 35:31.840
to turn the compliment, I don't want to do all the question asking. Well, let me say before I

35:31.840 --> 35:38.240
ask any question, I certainly want to join in paying tribute to Senator Johnson and Speaker

35:38.240 --> 35:45.600
Rayburn, and I'm glad that there isn't any question about where Texas is going to be in connection

35:45.680 --> 35:52.720
with the Democratic Party. Well, I've tried not to make any attacks on Governor Stevenson or his

35:53.600 --> 35:59.040
record, and I've regretted that he has made some on me. I think one

36:01.840 --> 36:05.280
matter that he did discuss a good deal after Minnesota, and that's a wonderful state,

36:05.280 --> 36:09.520
and I'd lay that in the middle of it too. I like it too. I wish there weren't so many Republicans.

36:10.240 --> 36:17.200
Well, you carried the most Republican district in Minnesota, so not by now.

36:18.880 --> 36:22.640
But anyway, it's a good state, and we all had a good time. I had a good time in Oregon too,

36:22.640 --> 36:30.160
and I know you had a better time, so that's that. But I was a little bit shocked, I must say,

36:30.160 --> 36:35.280
to find out that right afterwards that you started having a whole lot to say about the fact

36:35.440 --> 36:41.440
that I've been absent on some votes in the United States Senate. Your figures didn't agree with me,

36:41.440 --> 36:48.400
but you made three charges. You said that I'd been absent from votes in 1948 in the Senate,

36:49.440 --> 36:53.920
and the trouble was I wasn't even in the Senate in 1948. That were later to one.

36:55.120 --> 37:02.560
And the second was that I think Governor, that you should have known that the other period that

37:02.560 --> 37:06.960
you picked out that I was in many parts of this nation having hearings,

37:08.000 --> 37:13.600
trying to expose to the sunlight of public opinion, organized crime, criminal elements.

37:14.800 --> 37:19.760
Many people thought we were doing a worthwhile public service. I was excused from the Senate.

37:20.720 --> 37:26.880
I flew back during this time of a year and a half of the Senate Crime Committee for important votes,

37:26.880 --> 37:31.920
just like I flew back from Oregon the other day in Minnesota and California for votes.

37:33.120 --> 37:39.280
And then the third year you picked out was when I was having a life and death race for my own

37:40.960 --> 37:46.560
re-election in 1954 in the state of Tennessee. So I was a little bit surprised at you.

37:50.560 --> 37:56.880
I thought it necessary or proper to at least talk about this voting absenteeism as you call it,

37:56.880 --> 37:58.880
without at least pointing out these reasons.

37:58.880 --> 38:05.040
But I've got Mr. Davis that you got some questions or observations maybe that you would like to make.

38:05.040 --> 38:11.920
I think that if I were a candidate, I'm sorry. I was asked to explain why it was that there were so

38:12.720 --> 38:18.800
that the Senate had little support in the Senate. And I said that I thought possibly among his fellow

38:18.800 --> 38:24.640
senators that possibly one reason for it was that many of them felt that he had not done as much

38:24.640 --> 38:32.320
of the committee work as he should have and that I referred to the 83rd Congress. But I'd be

38:32.320 --> 38:39.920
quite willing to drop the matter to Senate once. Senator Kirsto in the 83rd Congress, I believe the

38:40.720 --> 38:48.480
question of absenteeism was covered by the congressional quarterly. And those figures of course were

38:48.480 --> 38:55.520
not flattering to the senator. It may have been that during that period he was had to be in Tennessee

38:55.520 --> 39:00.000
and the interest of his re-election. If so, I'm quite content with that explanation. I should

39:00.000 --> 39:04.720
like him to understand that the occasion for my mentioning this was in response to questions.

39:06.320 --> 39:11.360
Well, it seemed to have been the main part of an address that you made for us I could see.

39:13.200 --> 39:18.400
I said something more important than that. I'm certain Adelaide that you were not around

39:19.280 --> 39:22.880
the governor's chair in Springfield very much during the fall that you were running for

39:24.080 --> 39:28.720
as a democratic nominee for the president. So when you were in a race that's very difficult to

39:28.720 --> 39:32.560
be there very often. But the Senate was in the session when the race was on. Was it?

39:33.440 --> 39:38.480
Oh yes, when our primaries on, our primaries are held in the early part of August so that you have to

39:38.480 --> 39:45.120
run during May June and July. At any way you say that you were answering questions about the lack

39:45.120 --> 39:51.680
of support in the Senate. I haven't put any effort on my pressure on my colleagues to try to

39:51.680 --> 39:59.120
get support. I do have the support of some of my senators, some of my congressmen. I think I'll

39:59.120 --> 40:05.280
have more before it's over. The trouble was you started earlier and they've got many of them to

40:05.280 --> 40:11.440
sign up and agree with you. But I was glad to see in the congressional quarterly that I was tied

40:11.520 --> 40:17.280
for second place with congressional support along with Senator Lyndon Johnson for second place.

40:18.160 --> 40:23.920
And that's pretty good company to be in. I wonder if we could get on to another question. Now both

40:23.920 --> 40:28.720
of you gentlemen have traveled a great deal and shaken a lot of hands and talked to all kinds of

40:28.720 --> 40:34.240
people. I'd be interesting to find out what your sounding show of the people that you've talked to.

40:34.240 --> 40:39.360
What interests them? What do these people that you shake hands with and you get letters from and

40:39.360 --> 40:44.320
all at your mail? How does that run? What are the American people? Tumbled about, hopeful about,

40:44.320 --> 40:51.280
what do you gentlemen hear from the real grassroots? Senator, before you ask me,

40:51.280 --> 40:57.600
yes I think it's your turn. The main thing in the agricultural sections, and this is true all

40:57.600 --> 41:06.960
over the United States. The farmer's income has gone down about 27%. Their expenses are not going

41:06.960 --> 41:12.640
down. They've even risen. They have a fixed overhead that they must meet. So farmers,

41:12.640 --> 41:17.840
particularly small farmers, have been having a very hard time of it. They are in favor of an

41:17.840 --> 41:24.240
agricultural program that's going to give them a fair share of the nation's income. And in order to

41:24.240 --> 41:29.440
get prices that will bear a reasonable relationship to what they have to pay for what they get.

41:30.400 --> 41:36.160
That's what I've been trying to fight for. And I find particularly among the small farmers that there's

41:36.160 --> 41:41.760
a, that we have lost a million small farmers. Small farmers are not able to stay on the land.

41:42.960 --> 41:46.800
So that I found a good deal of interest and a proposal that I've been making for a

41:47.920 --> 41:54.720
so-called family size farm bill to have full or 100% parity for the first

41:55.760 --> 41:59.360
small part of a farmer's income and then have it graduated on down.

42:00.560 --> 42:05.280
So that the small farmer can at least get some protection that he can know about.

42:06.240 --> 42:12.240
And this is met with a great deal of a good reception. And I think if we're going to protect

42:12.240 --> 42:17.840
the small farmer and keep that this very valuable influence in our social and economic and

42:17.840 --> 42:22.480
political life that some special measures like this are going to have to be taken.

42:22.480 --> 42:26.880
Governor Stevenson, I think you were due for a little time now.

42:27.280 --> 42:32.400
Well, sir, I would say that the senator is quite right. And in many sections of the country,

42:33.280 --> 42:40.000
especially the rural agricultural sections of the country, the farm issue. And they're very

42:40.000 --> 42:47.200
rapid decline in farm income. The 27% drop in three years is the domestic issue of principal

42:47.200 --> 42:54.320
concern. It is also an, it's also a concern in becoming a concern in certain industrial areas

42:54.320 --> 43:00.960
because of the, of the effect that it's inevitably would have because of our economic

43:00.960 --> 43:06.560
interdependence on employment in certain aspects of industry, particularly in farm implement

43:06.560 --> 43:12.400
manufacture, where I believe farm interdependence is now down more than 20% in the first quarter of

43:12.400 --> 43:19.200
this year. And the result is large layoffs in Chicago and in Minneapolis and various other farm

43:19.200 --> 43:25.360
implement centers. It's also having effect on small business in the small towns, the merchant,

43:25.360 --> 43:31.360
the farmer can't buy shoes. If he, I mean, if he can't sell, if he's caught in this cost price

43:31.360 --> 43:37.040
squeeze as he is, he can't, his purchasing power is diminished. And obviously the effect of that

43:37.040 --> 43:44.160
is that he's unable to buy hardware, furniture, clothing and so on in the local market. And the

43:44.160 --> 43:48.160
small business man is suffering. Did I give you, Governor Stevenson, a chance to ask your question

43:48.160 --> 43:52.960
senator, keep all the, perhaps I, we spent all our time in his question to you when you are

43:52.960 --> 43:55.760
a flyaway. Did you have any other question you want to ask him? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'd

43:55.760 --> 44:01.520
ask him when he was going back to California. I don't know what to get about. I guess we'll be out about

44:01.520 --> 44:07.760
the same day. Well, Governor Stevenson started mentioning something that's very important.

44:08.800 --> 44:13.840
The effect on small business, small business and middle size of business and merchants were having

44:13.840 --> 44:18.080
a rough time of it. Their profits are there, I'm considerably, while there's big business

44:18.080 --> 44:25.200
is up. I think we need several things and we all have a strong program to try to keep small

44:25.200 --> 44:31.600
business in the picture. When I think that we must revise our antitrust laws, strengthen our

44:31.600 --> 44:40.240
Robinson Patman Act S11, which Congressman Patman and I have filed, we should have a notification

44:40.240 --> 44:45.120
period when a merger is going to take place or is to try to stop this merger effort. Small

44:45.120 --> 44:50.480
business ought to be able to have a better situation in the tax picture to have the surtax

44:50.480 --> 44:56.320
started 50,000. Then we need desperately some agency in Washington that will enable small business

44:56.320 --> 45:04.000
to get some of the procurement from the defense department and others and also to furnish them

45:04.000 --> 45:09.520
equity capital when necessary. But unless something's done for our small businesses and unless this

45:09.520 --> 45:16.560
great merger movement, which is giving small business people stronger and stronger and worse

45:16.560 --> 45:21.840
competition, we are going to have more and more of this country in the hands of fewer and fewer

45:21.840 --> 45:26.800
people, which is not a good situation. The situation is serious and I think perhaps more serious

45:26.800 --> 45:32.320
as to how many of our listeners tonight, viewers tonight, will realize especially in the

45:33.280 --> 45:40.080
East. I believe that bankruptcies now in small business, small business failures are at a higher

45:40.080 --> 45:47.920
rate than they have been at any time since 1941. Profits were off last year over the previous two years

45:47.920 --> 45:54.640
by something like 66%. This is a critical matter. The senator has mentioned, I think one of the

45:54.640 --> 46:02.160
major problems, of course, is credit. Availability of credit for them to operate, but it's a trend that

46:02.160 --> 46:08.560
is going on and it's a serious thing and it presents very fundamental philosophical considerations

46:08.560 --> 46:13.760
that trend towards bigness. I'd like to ask another more general question perhaps and that is both

46:13.760 --> 46:19.280
of you have campaigned very hard in the primaries. You've used all kinds of techniques. Back in 48,

46:19.280 --> 46:24.160
the Harry Truman did pretty well with the old-fashioned whistle stop in 52, present Eisenhower did well

46:24.160 --> 46:29.440
with modern TV. How do you appraise these various means of reaching the public today?

46:29.840 --> 46:34.720
Well, this is very important, this television, if you have money to buy it, we haven't had much

46:34.720 --> 46:41.600
money to have in it. Radio, of course, newspapers, but I think there's nothing like getting out and

46:42.400 --> 46:46.400
talking with and finding out what the people are thinking, meeting the people personally.

46:47.440 --> 46:53.200
My friend and Governor Stevens has taken that up. I saw where he was shaking hands with a wax

46:53.760 --> 46:58.240
model down in the store the other day. Tempted. Found a very tempting.

47:00.720 --> 47:07.360
Well, I just say that you've been doing better recently than I have.

47:08.640 --> 47:14.720
I think in addition, Mr. Howe to the what Sunder said, the problem of the use of these

47:14.720 --> 47:21.520
media is a very cute one. It's going to get a major test in the forthcoming campaign. Obviously,

47:21.520 --> 47:29.360
the cost of television on any large scale is very, very high. Yet that is the medium that reaches

47:29.360 --> 47:35.040
the most people. And the hour is always an hour, and even though it seems like no time at all,

47:35.040 --> 47:38.560
the time has now come, the hour has not, but the time for the discussion has run out and the

47:38.560 --> 47:43.120
summation has come. Each of you has five minutes, as you know, to sum up under a general heading

47:43.120 --> 47:48.560
of why I am a candidate, and as I explained earlier, Toss of the coin gave Governor Stevenson

47:48.560 --> 47:53.600
the chance to put his statement first, Senator Keith, all the second, and now we will hear first

47:53.600 --> 47:58.800
from the Governor Stevenson in the first of the summations in five minutes why I am a candidate.

48:01.840 --> 48:10.160
I don't think that anyone, Mr. Howe, runs for President or should run for the presidency of the

48:10.160 --> 48:16.800
United States in this age and day, just to serve a personal ambition, or just because you want

48:16.800 --> 48:21.920
the job or would like the work. I think you run for President because you have profound

48:22.720 --> 48:29.040
convictions about the principles of your party, that you have profound convictions about the

48:29.040 --> 48:35.600
state of the Union and the world in which we live, and that you have some idea at least about what

48:35.600 --> 48:42.080
should be done about it. When you have those in combination, and you also are beset by many

48:43.040 --> 48:49.120
many leaders of your party, as well as the rank and file, to undertake this most responsible,

48:50.640 --> 49:00.000
this most responsible task in democratic society, I think you do it and you don't spare yourself.

49:01.520 --> 49:08.320
You don't spare yourself from the body. I, your body from the back. I felt that I had all of those

49:09.120 --> 49:15.040
circumstances in combination, and in addition to that, I had strong convictions about some of the

49:15.040 --> 49:20.800
things that I think are wrong with our country. I have a feeling that the President of the

49:20.800 --> 49:25.840
Government, the Eisenhower administration, is basically a single interest government, that it is

49:26.480 --> 49:32.400
manned and staffed at the top of the policy-making positions, and proponderably by people

49:32.400 --> 49:37.520
representative of only one interest in our community, call it big business, call it big money,

49:37.520 --> 49:42.480
call it big industry, or call it what you please. And the government to be successful must be

49:43.040 --> 49:48.560
representative and reflect the interests of all of our people, and that this government does not.

49:49.200 --> 49:55.120
I felt that, and that my party, traditionally, has been the party of all the people, and that it

49:55.120 --> 50:00.560
was the best instrument to bring that about. In addition, I felt very strongly about a variety of

50:00.560 --> 50:05.120
issues of which we have mentioned here, of which I should like to mention more, the conservation

50:05.200 --> 50:12.800
of our resources, the development of our resources, about the Bill of Rights, about our liberties,

50:12.800 --> 50:19.520
if you please, and the abuses that they have suffered in late years. And countless other domestic

50:19.520 --> 50:25.120
issues, which I'm afraid time does not permit me to mention, but transcendent and more important

50:25.120 --> 50:30.560
even than all of those, is the problem of war and peace in the world. We have this great domestic

50:31.520 --> 50:36.400
issue of the relationship, the tensions that are rising, unhappily between the races in this

50:36.400 --> 50:42.560
country which we must master, we just must master. We have an addition to that, this crisis in the

50:42.560 --> 50:47.760
world, this new threat, this new challenge from the Soviet Union. I don't think that we're

50:47.760 --> 50:53.840
faring well in the Cold War, and I think that the reasons are relatively obvious, and that until

50:53.840 --> 51:00.080
we can, once more, until the image of America is clear and distinct and decisive, until the

51:00.560 --> 51:06.160
uncommitted peoples, until the underprivileged, underdeveloped, unhappy peoples of the world,

51:06.160 --> 51:12.800
real, who realize that hunger, disease, and the want and oppression are not the immutable destiny

51:12.800 --> 51:17.200
of man, and that we understand that, and we're sympathetic, and that we, the United States,

51:17.920 --> 51:23.760
of creature, of revolution, child of revolution, is their friend, that we will have trouble,

51:24.400 --> 51:31.280
and that we also have to, to not only recapture their confidence, but in addition to that,

51:31.280 --> 51:38.720
we must also make it transparently clear that we are going to continue strong, that we are going

51:38.720 --> 51:46.640
to continue resolute, and that we likewise will never be one to refuse to negotiate, to refuse to talk,

51:46.640 --> 51:54.160
to refuse to meet our enemy's halfway, be it in Egypt now, be it a meeting now, of our foreign

51:54.160 --> 52:01.840
ministers to see what can be done, to resolve the threats that hover over that eastern Mediterranean

52:01.840 --> 52:10.880
in Israel. I have spoken hurriedly, and not too carefully, Mr. Howe, but I can summarize my feeling

52:11.840 --> 52:19.920
that the undertaking to run for president at this time is a, as some, an undertaking is a human being

52:20.960 --> 52:28.320
can attempt. I have done it thoughtfully, I have done it perhaps advisedly because I have done it before,

52:29.680 --> 52:35.600
and I did it under circumstances which gave me satisfaction. I conducted a campaign that I think

52:36.560 --> 52:41.360
myself and my party. I would hope that I might be able to do it again for reasons that I have

52:41.360 --> 52:47.200
indicated and that I feel very deeply. Thank you very much, Governor Stevenson, and now you have

52:47.200 --> 52:51.920
the same opportunity, Senator Keefe, over to address yourself to the same subject and tell us why

52:51.920 --> 52:58.960
you were a candidate. Well, Mr. Howe, the first became interested in 1952, because I've been in the

52:58.960 --> 53:03.440
House of Representatives and the United States Senate for some time, and there were a lot of things

53:03.440 --> 53:09.200
that I wanted to try to do that I thought were important. One of the particular things that

53:09.200 --> 53:16.160
that that time was that it found that organized crime and the criminal element had infiltrated into

53:16.160 --> 53:23.040
politics and to our life and economic life, badly affecting our country, and I wanted our government

53:23.040 --> 53:29.280
to take as strong a position as possible to rid the nation of this element and to keep them under

53:29.280 --> 53:35.120
control. Much has been done, but I think a whole lot more needs to be done and a whole lot is the

53:35.120 --> 53:41.360
federal responsibility. And then in the American tradition and for the sake of a secure and

53:41.360 --> 53:47.360
wholesome economy, I think we must reestablish a fair balance between industry and business,

53:47.360 --> 53:54.080
agriculture and labor, with each receiving his fair share of the national income. Farmers undoubtedly

53:54.080 --> 53:59.360
have been penalized in the last three years. I want them to get a fair price for their products,

53:59.360 --> 54:04.160
and I'm especially interested in working for the welfare of the little farmer, so we won't lose

54:04.160 --> 54:09.840
this very valuable part of our American life. Now, I think we must see to it that labor and labor

54:09.840 --> 54:17.200
unions can work and organize under a fair labor relations law, and the interest of that will be

54:17.200 --> 54:23.040
fair to labor and to management and to the public too. I don't think the taft hardly law is such a law.

54:23.600 --> 54:30.320
It denies a union protection to a great many people. I think it ought to be drastically revised and

54:30.320 --> 54:35.760
rewritten in many respects. And then I've always been interested in the welfare of small business

54:35.760 --> 54:40.880
for a long time. I think we must protect in many ways that I talked about a little while ago with

54:40.880 --> 54:47.120
a small and the middle-sized businessman and the merchant against the avalanche of economic

54:47.120 --> 54:53.040
concentration, which is coming up in this nation today. I'm very much interested in social security

54:53.040 --> 54:57.280
and old age assistance legislation. I've worked for them ever since I've been in public life.

54:58.080 --> 55:02.400
I want us to amend our social security law at this session of Congress, if possible, who

55:03.040 --> 55:08.480
tell you those who are totally and permanently disabled at 50 years of age. And we must see that our

55:08.480 --> 55:16.080
old age assistance laws are extended and that the determents are taken out of the way so that our

55:16.960 --> 55:24.080
elderly citizens can live with dignity and without want in their last years. I'm interested very much

55:24.080 --> 55:30.080
in education. I want us to as long as we have a single child who doesn't have an educational

55:30.080 --> 55:36.320
opportunity. As long as our teachers are underpaid, I feel that we do have a very important challenge

55:36.320 --> 55:41.280
in which the federal government must play a part. I have of course been interested in resource

55:41.280 --> 55:47.120
development and I want our federal government to play its part in trying to see that great projects

55:47.120 --> 55:53.840
like the Southern and Central Valley floor of project are carried on that rivers of our, the water

55:53.840 --> 55:59.360
of our rivers are harnessed for the benefit of our people for irrigation and for power. We must

55:59.360 --> 56:07.040
keep this in nation of increasing opportunities for all of our people. And I feel also that in the

56:07.120 --> 56:15.520
world today that if we would just use our spiritual and economic influence, our great strength as a

56:15.520 --> 56:21.120
nation with all of our ties to many other nations and interests of peace, that we can have peace with

56:21.120 --> 56:27.040
honor in our lifetime. And that's very important to the young people of this nation, to all of us.

56:27.680 --> 56:32.080
I feel in the first place we must take effective steps to hold together the people who believe in

56:32.080 --> 56:40.080
freedom, who believe in democracy and NATO in united nations. Also we must take a firm position

56:40.080 --> 56:46.320
against colonialism and be a helper to people who are trying to get self-government because they're

56:46.320 --> 56:53.120
doing just exactly what we did 175 years ago. We must make our position crystal clear in all parts

56:53.120 --> 56:58.560
of the world, like in the Middle East. I think we must formalize and have a non-aggression

56:58.560 --> 57:03.920
tax with offer them to little Israel into the Arab nations and help solve the refugee problem.

57:04.880 --> 57:10.000
We must meet this new Russian smile. We must have a flexible foreign policy so that we can

57:10.880 --> 57:16.960
use our best ambassadors, our best means, our best tradition for the purpose of trying to bring about

57:16.960 --> 57:23.360
peace. In the final analysis, it seems to me that our national security rests not only on our armed

57:23.360 --> 57:29.840
forces, but equally and perhaps even to a more important extent. It resides in our great

57:29.840 --> 57:36.560
conception of government, our belief in democracy and in human freedom. It resides in our

57:36.560 --> 57:42.240
bill of rights and in the Constitution. These are weapons just like other weapons, and if we use

57:42.240 --> 57:48.400
them we can move and stir the hearts of people everywhere. These are all things that we want,

57:49.040 --> 57:53.840
like Sir Thomas Moore said for those things for which we pray, let us have the grace and

57:53.840 --> 57:58.640
strength to the labor. I want to labor for these things and I would like to leave the American people

57:58.640 --> 58:04.160
in trying to get them. That's the reason I want to be president. Thank you. Thank you both.

58:04.160 --> 58:08.800
Very much, Senator Keefeauver and Governor Stevenson, they're especially gratified that the

58:08.800 --> 58:14.960
emphasis you both put on world affairs and I hope the listeners and viewers enjoyed it as much as

58:14.960 --> 58:19.120
I did. I think it's the most important feature of the campaign. I'm glad you took the time on it.

58:19.120 --> 58:23.440
You know the people you've been in touch with them and the fact that you have had this first hand

58:23.440 --> 58:27.840
inside into the way the voters feel and still would like to have given them a whole time to

58:27.840 --> 58:32.880
peace and international affairs. That's one of the most hotening signs of this evening's discussion.

58:33.360 --> 58:39.360
So this is Quincy Howe with Senator Keefeauver and Governor Stevenson saying good night from

58:39.360 --> 58:46.160
studios of WTWTBJ in Miami.

58:52.720 --> 58:55.200
This is the ABC television network.
