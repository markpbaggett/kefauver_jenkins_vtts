00:00.000 --> 00:11.120
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the United States Senate passed civil rights

00:11.120 --> 00:12.120
bill this week.

00:12.120 --> 00:17.920
The first bill, a measure of this time, and has passed the Senate of the United States

00:17.920 --> 00:19.920
in more than 80 years.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.760
The vote was 72 to 18.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.840
I hope that as a result, we may be on the way toward removing this issue from the political

00:27.840 --> 00:28.840
arena.

00:28.920 --> 00:32.800
Because it has been very divisive of our people.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.320
As this is being explained, the final fate of the bill is unknown.

00:36.320 --> 00:41.560
The cost now goes to the House of Representatives, where the question will be decided as to

00:41.560 --> 00:44.400
further and not they will accept the Senate bill.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.640
You will hear a great deal about the so-called jury-child amendment, which our crew

00:48.640 --> 00:49.640
offers.

00:49.640 --> 00:54.240
It's a good amendment, fairly workable, and I hope that it is retained in the bill in

00:54.240 --> 00:55.240
the House.

00:55.960 --> 01:01.120
This is a right for vote bill, and as such, it will have little application to Tennessee.

01:01.120 --> 01:06.520
Because in our state, anyone who is eligible to vote under state law, but maybe with some

01:06.520 --> 01:11.480
few exceptions has been voting for now for many, many years.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.120
Also this week, the Annie Trusts and Monopoly Subcommittee, of which I am chairman, began

01:16.120 --> 01:21.160
hearings in connection with the recent steel price increase.

01:21.160 --> 01:26.680
Senator Lyndon Johnson, the Democratic leader, says that, as far as he is concerned, we

01:26.680 --> 01:30.760
will get up the TBA self-financing bill very soon now.

01:30.760 --> 01:35.080
But there are many, many other things going on in Washington.

01:35.080 --> 01:40.520
And I want to show you a film made of one of the more exciting events this week.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.880
The contest to see which is better tasty.

01:42.880 --> 01:48.480
The Tennessee Blue Catfish or the Colorado Mountain Count.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.800
And now here's the film.

01:50.800 --> 01:56.880
Last week we have had a very important contest in the nation's capital here in Washington.

01:56.880 --> 02:03.400
The purpose of the contest was to decide once and all definitely which was the most delicious.

02:03.400 --> 02:08.760
Tennessee Blue Cat or a Colorado Mountain Count.

02:08.760 --> 02:14.880
On Tuesday of this week, in the Senate dining room in the nation's capital, Tennessee,

02:14.880 --> 02:19.760
the delicious Tennessee Blue Cat from Savannah, Tennessee were served for the members of the

02:19.760 --> 02:24.880
President and to the members of the press here in the nation's capital.

02:24.880 --> 02:31.720
And serving the Tennessee Blue Cat was the theme of the Catfish Burby, Miss Linda Stamps,

02:31.720 --> 02:35.640
who is on my right here, this charming young lady.

02:35.640 --> 02:42.000
And also serving the hush puppies was Miss Patricia Eves, the lady in waiting of a

02:42.000 --> 02:45.920
Queen Linda who is on her right.

02:45.920 --> 02:52.960
And on Friday of this week, Senator John Carroll of Colorado brought in the Colorado Mountain

02:52.960 --> 02:53.960
Count.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.720
And I'm sure that everybody enjoyed them too, but not quite as much.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.960
And now here is Senator Carroll and the votes are in yet, but I'm certain that when all

03:02.960 --> 03:07.200
the senators have voted, that Tennessee Catfish will have won to stint down.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.240
Well, I must say Senator Keapalver, that the Catfish will exit.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.240
Don't question about that.

03:14.240 --> 03:21.240
The Tennessee Blue Catfish are very good in the hush puppies too, but you didn't do proper

03:21.240 --> 03:22.920
in this context.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.040
You had no business bringing these beauties in.

03:26.040 --> 03:31.920
The vote was taken on the basis of the delicacy of the Catfish, but upon the beauty of the

03:31.920 --> 03:34.240
girls that come from Tennessee.

03:34.240 --> 03:40.120
But notwithstanding that, the Colorado Rainbow Trout speak for themselves.

03:40.120 --> 03:44.040
The votes are in, as a matter of fact, we're ahead.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.840
Senator Keapalver is waiting for the absentee vote.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.560
And I don't think it'll be too successful with that beneath.

03:49.560 --> 03:55.840
Well, John, I think that you really, uh, we take, of course, I think the Tennessee Catfish

03:55.840 --> 04:00.880
are the best, but we feel that we must have won the contest as well, because we did have

04:00.880 --> 04:04.120
a Linda and Cat here.

04:04.120 --> 04:08.120
Queen Linda Stamps from Cookville, what do you think about the contest?

04:08.120 --> 04:09.120
How'd you get along?

04:09.120 --> 04:16.120
Well, it's really been one point for me, everyone, the senators and everyone has been marvelous

04:16.120 --> 04:19.120
to us all.

04:19.120 --> 04:27.120
And although I wasn't here Friday for the trial, anything, I'm sure that the Blue Catfish

04:27.120 --> 04:28.120
won out.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.120
Well, that's fine.

04:29.120 --> 04:33.120
And then, uh, had you served the hush puppies for them, how'd you get along?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.120
What'd you think about the contest?

04:35.120 --> 04:37.880
Well, it was just lots of fun.

04:37.880 --> 04:42.120
And I didn't know senators were so nice that they really are.

04:42.120 --> 04:49.120
But if I were, you'd seen the film so until next week at this time, that's all.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.120
Goodbye.

04:53.120 --> 04:59.120
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

04:59.120 --> 05:06.120
Tennessee has given to the nation many outstanding states from that, of course, free passengers,

05:06.120 --> 05:11.120
Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson and James K. Polk.

05:11.120 --> 05:15.120
But our end of day, Tennessee has a new president.

05:15.120 --> 05:20.120
And this is the prettiest president that we've ever had coming to.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.120
The bottom here is state.

05:23.120 --> 05:29.120
On now, the right is the Judith Paul, so happens Tennessee through this weekend Washington

05:29.120 --> 05:36.120
was elected president on girls' nation, selected from representatives of all states of the

05:36.120 --> 05:38.120
union who sent two girls to Washington.

05:38.120 --> 05:43.120
It's certainly good to have you, uh, President Judith, on the program that's with us today.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.120
Thanks, Dennis.

05:44.120 --> 05:49.120
And I know you may wonder if this is a mirrored reflection of Judith who is sitting on her right,

05:49.120 --> 05:52.120
who is not a reflection of Judith.

05:52.120 --> 05:59.120
This is Linda Qual, who is Judith's twin sister and she, along with Judith, was elected to

05:59.120 --> 06:04.120
represent Tennessee and girls' nation here in Washington.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.120
Well, Judith, how does it feel to be a president?

06:07.120 --> 06:11.120
I think it's the highlight of my life that they will be.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.120
And Linda, tell us about girls' nation.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.120
What is girls' nation?

06:15.120 --> 06:20.120
Well, as we study state government at girls' state, we study federal government at girls'

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
nation.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.120
You mean that you were elected in the state of Tennessee from the girls' there to represent

06:25.120 --> 06:27.120
Tennessee here in Washington?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.120
That's not.

06:28.120 --> 06:33.120
And you study state government there and you study national government.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.120
We come as senators too.

06:35.120 --> 06:40.120
And then, uh, when you come as senators and you had a meeting at the convention,

06:40.120 --> 06:44.120
you send a congress out of the University of Maryland, that's the right.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.120
Well, I wonder, the idea first comes to you to run for president girls' nation.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.120
Well, we all felt like that.

06:51.120 --> 06:56.120
And then, and I felt like the state said that there'd be leaders from every state and we thought

06:56.120 --> 07:00.120
we stood as good a chance because we felt qualified without training in girls' states.

07:00.120 --> 07:05.120
And so, we talked about it on the plane coming up and I decided to do it.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.120
Now, what part did you run on?

07:07.120 --> 07:09.120
I ran on the nationalist party.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.120
And then, what was your position, Linda?

07:11.120 --> 07:13.120
I was a federalist.

07:13.120 --> 07:17.120
And, uh, and so that you run in a different party from your sister.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
That's right.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.120
When you come from your state, they separate the girls.

07:20.120 --> 07:24.120
Well, I know that you were, were you her campaign manager in Tennessee?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.120
Yes, when she went for governor, I was her campaign manager.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.120
And you're hardly with her all the way up all the time up here.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.120
You certainly was.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.120
Well, there certainly is exciting.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.120
And then, now, what have you been doing?

07:33.120 --> 07:36.120
Have you been down to see any six people here in Washington?

07:36.120 --> 07:38.120
That's one of the highlights of the whole week.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.120
We've seen so many of the people that we've read about in the newspapers.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.120
Did you see the President?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.120
We saw the President.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.120
That's the small one.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.120
Good. How did you get along with him?

07:47.120 --> 07:48.120
Oh, we did.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.120
We're so impressed.

07:49.120 --> 07:54.120
He was the jolly's and he came out to talk to all the girls and came down the crowd.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.120
He had pictures made, really?

07:56.120 --> 07:59.120
Well, I wish he had been me that well.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.120
And then, you see in the vice president, you saw, I mean, Judith.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.120
So, you saw the vice president, too?

08:04.120 --> 08:06.120
Yes, we met him at his office.

08:06.120 --> 08:11.120
Well, Judith, what is the beauty of, what you have is the presence of the girls' nation?

08:11.120 --> 08:15.120
Yes, but I have been spent the entire day, appointing my cabinet and other house.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.120
Oh, your point over campus?

08:17.120 --> 08:18.120
Yes, sir.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.120
What do you appoint an officer?

08:19.120 --> 08:22.120
Lender is my nice little president of the Red Cross.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
Oh, good to you.

08:23.120 --> 08:27.120
I think she's under the desire of the opposition and that's because she's your twin sister.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.120
No reason why you should have one as a member.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.120
No.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.120
Well, then how long will you be president, Judith?

08:34.120 --> 08:35.120
Her first name.

08:35.120 --> 08:40.120
I'll be president until next year when a new one is elected in the 58th year of next year.

08:41.120 --> 08:45.120
Well, and then in the meantime, during this year, you'll make speeches over the country.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.120
I hope so, I certainly will laugh there.

08:47.120 --> 08:52.120
Well, I'll tell you that people down in Athens, you kind of see, are mighty, mighty proud of you.

08:52.120 --> 08:56.120
And all they'll be watching this with a great deal of interest.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.120
Well, you know, I ran for president in a couple of times.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.120
I didn't have any success.

09:01.120 --> 09:08.120
And here you came up here and got elected president of girls' nation, sponsored by the American Legion of Hillary, by the way.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.120
It's one of the finest things that has ever been done.

09:11.120 --> 09:15.120
And since I've been unsuccessful and you've been successful, Judith, what advice can you give me?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.120
Maybe I'll do better next time.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.120
To keep all right, say you need a twin like Linda.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.120
Because that way you can say, fly as many hands.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.120
You can do fly as much as you can.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.120
You can get fly as many babies.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.120
Oh, that's wonderful.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.120
Well, I've said to do thank you very much.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.120
I congratulate you.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.120
We're terribly proud of you and kind of see.

09:35.120 --> 09:41.120
And let me say that I think the American Legion of Hillary is doing a good job in sponsoring girls' nations

09:41.120 --> 09:46.120
because if these young people interested in politics and government, we'll have a better country as well.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.120
Thank you very much.

09:48.120 --> 10:10.120
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and gentlemen, I want to talk with you about several things which have occurred in Congress this week of importance to Tennessee.

10:10.120 --> 10:18.120
First of all, let me discuss with you the new action that has been taken in the Judith Air Committee on President, House, and House Civil Rights Bill.

10:18.120 --> 10:22.120
There were several votes on this amendment and this bill this week.

10:22.120 --> 10:31.120
The first of these amendments and the one that I will please of most importance and interest to the people in Tennessee was the so-called jury-tile amendment.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.120
This amendment was proposed by Senator Sam Irvin of North Carolina.

10:36.120 --> 10:43.120
He explained that it was in exactly the same language as the jury-tile provision in the North's Regardio Act.

10:43.120 --> 10:50.120
In the North's Regardio Act, the Congress was dealing with labor laws and this bill of course, revealing the right to vote.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.120
I voted for Senator Irvin's amendment.

10:52.120 --> 10:58.120
In fact, I have prepared an amendment just like this and if he hadn't sponsored it, I would have.

10:58.120 --> 11:05.120
As I've said so often, both sides in this controversy are inclined to talk in terms of slope rather than facts.

11:05.120 --> 11:10.120
I've tried always to examine the contents of the text and to vote according.

11:10.120 --> 11:16.120
As you know, I have been the victim of such abuse from those who have, from those who take anything,

11:16.120 --> 11:19.120
label civil rights and blindly a poosie.

11:19.120 --> 11:25.120
Those people had a field they attacked in the last week when I voted for Senator Irvin's amendment this week.

11:25.120 --> 11:29.120
The opposite side, including the Attorney General, had their field they.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.120
Well, both extremes, I think, are wrong.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.120
This jury-tile provision is not understanding.

11:35.120 --> 11:40.120
Well, operate just the same as the jury-tile provision in the North's Regardio Act.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.120
It is worked there and it will work here.

11:43.120 --> 11:52.120
It simply means that any person charged with some more contempt of court, not committed in the presence of the court, is entitled to a jury-tile.

11:52.120 --> 12:02.120
It is never easy to try to steer a steady course in such a controversial matter, but that is what I'm trying to do and what I'll show continue to try to do.

12:02.120 --> 12:06.120
Of course, I'm not the first man who has found this very difficult.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.120
Abraham Lincoln had the same problem when he wrote,

12:09.120 --> 12:14.120
if I were to try to read much less answers, all the attacks made on me,

12:14.120 --> 12:17.120
this shock might as well be flowed for any other business.

12:17.120 --> 12:21.120
I do the very best I know how, the very best I can,

12:21.120 --> 12:24.120
and I mean to keep on doing so until the end.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.120
That's what Justice Lincoln said.

12:27.120 --> 12:36.120
Now another thing I wanted to talk with you about today is a very interesting development in the hearings that you're holding on rapid-tax hammeredization.

12:36.120 --> 12:45.120
This chart, which we use that the hearing, shows the peculiar behavior of the Idaho Power Company stuff during a critical period.

12:45.120 --> 12:49.120
Mr. Gordon Gray, the director of the Office of Defense Mobilization,

12:49.120 --> 12:55.120
testified that he made up his mind to grant a rapid tax hammeredization certificate,

12:55.120 --> 13:07.120
which was worth around $339 million to the Idaho Power Company in connection with his health's Kenyan dams on April 10th or 9th.

13:07.120 --> 13:16.120
He told his staff about this and told four people at the White House and the representative of the Interior Department.

13:16.120 --> 13:22.120
The company eventually picked up the rapid tax hammeredization certificate on the 17th of 18th.

13:22.120 --> 13:27.120
The public wasn't told about it until on the 25th.

13:27.120 --> 13:32.120
Notice how many of these big jumps on the 18th and 9th of April,

13:32.120 --> 13:42.120
and on the 17th of April, the fourth public knew anything about the branding of the rapid tax hammeredization.

13:42.120 --> 13:46.120
And this was only on the New York Stock Exchange.

13:46.120 --> 13:51.120
We're checking the West Coast board to see what happened there.

13:51.120 --> 14:00.120
That seems quite likely that someone with inside information made a big killing on the market, on the basis of the tax hammeredization certificate to the Idaho Power Company.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.120
We intend to get to the bottom of this.

14:03.120 --> 14:10.120
And please remember that there's more to the public target power fight than simply a point of view.

14:10.120 --> 14:16.120
As this chart indicates, big money, very big money is involved in this fight.

14:16.120 --> 14:21.120
And it doesn't matter of great importance to a TBA area,

14:21.120 --> 14:27.120
to those who are interested in low cost electricity, and those who are interested in small business,

14:27.120 --> 14:33.120
which never does get any of these tax hammeredizations, having a fair and even break.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.120
Thank you and goodbye until next week.
