WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.240
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this is Esther's Keith Orville bringing you

00:10.240 --> 00:16.140
the first in a series of television programs from the nation's capital, where we will

00:16.140 --> 00:21.760
review from time to time the Seedings in Congress and happenings of importance are going

00:21.760 --> 00:22.760
on in Washington.

00:22.760 --> 00:27.440
Last year we did this for five minutes once a week.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.880
This year in order to have more depth in the news and be able to have more distinguished

00:31.880 --> 00:34.880
guests on the program we are going to take 15 minutes.

00:34.880 --> 00:39.600
Now, I certainly appreciate the station carrying this program as a public service.

00:39.600 --> 00:45.320
I will appreciate you writing me in a suggestions about the program so that we can make it more

00:45.320 --> 00:46.960
useful and more informative.

00:46.960 --> 00:55.560
Today, we are highly honored to have on our next program or be four weeks from today.

00:55.560 --> 01:00.320
Today we are highly honored to have with us the new majority leader, the Democratic

01:00.320 --> 01:03.640
leader of the United States Senate.

01:03.640 --> 01:09.680
We had a able and efficient leader in Senator Lyndon B. Johnson for the past eight or

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
nine years.

01:10.680 --> 01:16.240
Senator Johnson has been elevated to the vice presidency, as all of you know.

01:16.240 --> 01:22.120
And succeeding him is the distinguished senator from Montana, Mike Mansfield.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.440
I think it's certainly good to have you.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.280
You were elected by unanimous vote of all of the Democratic senators.

01:28.280 --> 01:32.240
We thank you for your efficient able, that you will carry out the program for the good

01:32.240 --> 01:33.240
of the people.

01:33.240 --> 01:38.600
And I want you to say introduce you to the people of Tennessee.

01:38.600 --> 01:43.160
Well, as to say, I only hope that I can live up to the high hopes, the high expectations

01:43.160 --> 01:47.280
that you and my other colleagues have placed in me.

01:47.280 --> 01:52.840
I have no illusions about the job, but I'm depending upon people like you and others to help

01:52.840 --> 01:54.720
me over the rough spots.

01:54.720 --> 02:01.640
We'll do our best collectively to reinforce the Kennedy program and to try and get this

02:01.640 --> 02:06.400
country back on an even keel and to bring some stability in the field of foreign relations.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.160
Well, Mike, you've been our very effective whip.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.400
That's the second in command for a number of years.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.880
We all know of your ability, your sincerity, your great integrity, and your forward-looking

02:17.880 --> 02:23.480
ideas about what's good for our nation and what's good for our best chance of having peace

02:23.480 --> 02:25.120
in the world.

02:25.120 --> 02:30.000
And you can certainly count on all of us to help you in every way that we possibly can.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.120
Incidentally, folks, Senator Mansfield is no stranger to Tennessee.

02:35.120 --> 02:43.200
We've served in a house of representatives from 1943 until I left in 1948, and then

02:43.200 --> 02:48.960
you came to the Senate in 1950, I believe, Mike.

02:48.960 --> 02:54.800
Back in 1954, when I was running for my second term in the United States Senate, Senator

02:54.800 --> 03:00.160
Mansfield was good enough to come down to Cookville, Tennessee, where he made the opening speech

03:00.160 --> 03:02.560
in my campaign during that year.

03:02.560 --> 03:08.160
A lot of people in Nashville and Cookville remember you very pleasantly.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
You remember that occasion?

03:09.160 --> 03:15.160
Esther, I certainly do, and I remember the final speech that you ever made to.

03:15.160 --> 03:19.160
Well, the reason was because it was one of the nicest groups I've ever faced.

03:19.160 --> 03:24.600
But you know, I want to go back to Tennessee someday to spend some time in the mountains and

03:24.600 --> 03:29.440
the western part of your state to look over the TVA and see the benefits it's brought to

03:29.440 --> 03:30.440
your people.

03:30.440 --> 03:35.720
And incidentally, you know there's a great deal of similarity between Montana and Tennessee.

03:35.720 --> 03:43.040
We have mountains, we have dams, we have rivers that need controlling, and you may be surprised.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.520
Everybody thinks that people from Tennessee always migrate to Texas, but we have a good

03:46.520 --> 03:51.040
many Tennessee and South Montana, and I'm happy to say they're a good demifact.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.040
Well, that's right, Mike.

03:52.040 --> 03:56.560
I was out there during the last campaign, and I saw a lot of them serve at the Tour de Moles

03:56.560 --> 03:57.560
in the Vaux-Ovoat right.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.520
We want you to come back because we both of our states are developing.

04:01.520 --> 04:07.080
We have great plans for the future, and we want you to bring Maureen down sometime, and

04:07.080 --> 04:13.560
the session is not so pectic and enjoy our mountains, the TVA and our people.

04:13.560 --> 04:17.560
Well, Mike, what's the program?

04:17.560 --> 04:23.520
First let's say, talk about the members of the cabinet and the official family that President

04:23.520 --> 04:26.440
of that kind of he has designated.

04:26.440 --> 04:30.840
I think that he has a fine team in the field with foreign affairs.

04:30.840 --> 04:36.000
I think he has experienced people, and I think he's getting a well all-around group of

04:36.000 --> 04:40.360
people to carry a part of his new frontier program.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.840
What is your feeling about it?

04:41.840 --> 04:43.440
I agree with you, Estes.

04:43.440 --> 04:48.240
I think that he's made a wonderful set of selections so far.

04:48.240 --> 04:52.920
It is anticipated that beginning very shortly, the appropriate committees in the Senate will

04:52.920 --> 04:58.200
start hearings on these nominees so that we can bring them to the floor of the Senate

04:58.200 --> 05:01.920
shortly after the inaugural for confirmation.

05:01.920 --> 05:06.560
And after that, we will, of course, expect the committees likewise to start hearings before

05:06.560 --> 05:12.840
the inauguration on the various legislative proposals, which President-elect Kennedy has

05:12.840 --> 05:15.920
announced during the course of his campaign and since.

05:15.920 --> 05:22.440
Mike, as much as he has picked good people in, and as much as the Senate always respects

05:22.440 --> 05:28.240
the rise in the desire of the President to have the people that he wants to help him,

05:28.240 --> 05:32.480
I wouldn't anticipate any trouble on any confirmation of any of the cabinet members

05:32.480 --> 05:33.480
that you've...

05:33.480 --> 05:41.180
No, I dare say that all of them will be approved fairly expeditiously, and I look for

05:41.180 --> 05:45.980
little friction, little argument, and fairly speedy consideration and approval.

05:45.980 --> 05:51.820
Mike, I've been telling everybody that I thought there were so many problems in the world,

05:51.820 --> 05:58.400
both domestically with unemployment and difficulties we're having here at home as well as many

05:58.400 --> 06:00.980
tactic problems and international affairs.

06:00.980 --> 06:06.700
I thought we would have very good teamwork both among the insiports, the Democrats are

06:06.700 --> 06:11.740
concerned, and insofar as the Republicans are concerned, at least far as considerable

06:11.740 --> 06:14.060
period of time, a good honeymoon with...

06:14.060 --> 06:15.540
Do you think that will be true?

06:15.540 --> 06:20.860
Yes, I think so, especially in the field of foreign policy, I believe that both parties

06:20.860 --> 06:26.300
will place the interest of the country ahead of the interest of their particular parties.

06:26.300 --> 06:32.220
I think even in the field of domestic affairs that will not feed the friction, which

06:32.220 --> 06:38.380
are great many anticipate because many Republicans will vote for these programs and do so all

06:38.380 --> 06:42.780
the more willingly because they are now not under pressure from the White House to vote

06:42.780 --> 06:46.100
the way the White House wants them to.

06:46.100 --> 06:50.660
So I look forward to a period of harmony and unity.

06:50.660 --> 06:54.620
There may be a few squabbles here and there, but it wouldn't be a Senate or a Democratic

06:54.620 --> 06:57.420
party if we didn't have these squabbles occasionally.

06:57.420 --> 07:03.260
I anticipate that we'll carry through the President's program in fairly good fashion,

07:03.260 --> 07:08.740
and I would hope that when this session of the Congress is concluded, we would be judged

07:08.740 --> 07:12.900
not under quantity of the legislation which we passed, but rather the quality.

07:12.900 --> 07:17.220
Well, that's what we all hope for and let's hope the honeymoon lasts as long as possible

07:17.220 --> 07:22.780
and we can get the President's program over and get some things done for the people and

07:22.780 --> 07:25.220
improve our situation in the world.

07:25.220 --> 07:31.860
On our Mr. Majority Leader, Mike, we are now engaged in a fight about the amendment of

07:31.860 --> 07:39.900
rule 22, which is the, as all of you know, is the rule about the termination of the

07:39.900 --> 07:43.780
date and preventing lengthy filibusters.

07:43.780 --> 07:45.580
What is the situation about that?

07:45.580 --> 07:48.300
Are we going to be able to get that behind us pretty soon?

07:48.300 --> 07:49.980
I would hope so, Estes.

07:49.980 --> 07:54.860
I would imagine that there will be a motion to table or move the previous question and

07:54.860 --> 07:56.660
do time.

07:56.660 --> 08:01.700
That will bring this matter to a head and then we will be able to get on to the business

08:01.700 --> 08:04.300
of the President's program.

08:04.300 --> 08:09.220
You know, I think people ought to recognize the fact that while there is a need for some

08:09.220 --> 08:16.060
reform in rule 22, that the important thing now is to get the President's program underway.

08:16.060 --> 08:23.060
Then, confesses a great many facets in the field of our domestic economy, housing,

08:23.060 --> 08:26.740
for example, which is in a terrible slump at the present time and which will do much

08:26.740 --> 08:29.820
to create employment for our people.

08:29.820 --> 08:33.700
The depressed area is, and I'm sure you have some of them down in your state as I have

08:33.700 --> 08:34.700
in mind.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.580
Mike, on that subject, depressed areas, we are getting more letters about that than most

08:38.580 --> 08:39.820
in the other subject.

08:39.820 --> 08:46.340
We have some 76 communities where they do have severe unemployment, particularly in

08:46.340 --> 08:52.980
cool mining sections like in Marians, the Quatsy and Grondi County where the coal is running

08:52.980 --> 08:58.060
out and it's expensive to manage it and we have some very bad situations so that bill

08:58.060 --> 09:02.020
is greatly needed in many parts of Tennessee as it is elsewhere.

09:02.020 --> 09:06.140
Do you think, of course, we passed a bill one time in Congress and you got vetoed as

09:06.140 --> 09:07.140
that?

09:07.140 --> 09:08.140
That's right, Paul.

09:08.140 --> 09:11.900
But now we have a President who will not be to a bill of that kind and I think we can

09:11.900 --> 09:16.220
pass the bill more in keeping with the realities of the situation.

09:16.220 --> 09:22.900
And Mike, about unemployment, unemployment is a pretty high peak.

09:22.900 --> 09:28.620
And what is your feeling about the best thing we can do in the most expeditious land to

09:28.620 --> 09:31.220
try to enable people to get back to work properly?

09:31.220 --> 09:38.100
Well, I think we ought to engage upon the President's program, aged depressed areas, both

09:38.100 --> 09:44.140
rural and urban, a housing program which will spur the construction industry and give

09:44.140 --> 09:50.700
sustenance to our people, aid to education, raising the minimum wage, all these are important

09:50.700 --> 09:55.620
and all of them are necessary because if my information is correct by about the first

09:55.620 --> 10:01.860
of February, we will have something on the order of five million, perhaps more unemployed.

10:01.860 --> 10:06.820
Now this has been referred to during the course of the late campaign as a quote, pause,

10:06.820 --> 10:09.180
unquote, in our economy.

10:09.180 --> 10:11.540
I hope it is not the pause that he presses.

10:11.540 --> 10:15.900
It is certainly something which calls for action with a man like Kennedy in the White House.

10:15.900 --> 10:21.260
Action will be taken to try and alleviate the situations in what you, in these areas

10:21.260 --> 10:26.860
you referred to, sometimes known as pockets of poverty, so that men and women able and

10:26.860 --> 10:33.140
willing will have the opportunity and the right to work and achieve a decent livelihood.

10:33.140 --> 10:41.300
Well, Mike, I always heard that I feel that a good housing program, and we had two vetoed

10:41.300 --> 10:47.140
last year and we finally got through a very, very watered-down housing program which is

10:47.140 --> 10:48.140
not adequate at all.

10:48.140 --> 10:53.740
But do more to spur and to increase employment immediately than almost anything else, not

10:53.740 --> 11:00.260
only in the timber industry and among construction workers, but also in the factories where they

11:00.260 --> 11:04.780
make frigidaires, stoves, and cuters and furnaces.

11:04.780 --> 11:07.660
So I imagine that will be how on the priority list.

11:07.660 --> 11:11.740
It will indeed, and what you said is correct because it goes far beyond the building of a

11:11.740 --> 11:16.880
house that affects so many other fields of economic endeavor, that what it does is create

11:16.880 --> 11:20.900
employment as it goes along and I think we ought to do something to overcome the terrible

11:20.900 --> 11:23.460
slump and housing evident this past year.

11:23.460 --> 11:28.380
And Mike and Montana, you are interested in the development of the harnessing of the

11:28.380 --> 11:32.500
Columbia and the Missouri River and other rivers.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.980
We in Tennessee, of course, are very proud of the Tennessee Valley Authority and for the

11:36.980 --> 11:42.660
information of all you've got folks as Senator and Mansfield, both as a Congressman and

11:42.660 --> 11:48.420
as a Senator, has always been a power strength for the Tennessee Valley Authority to protect

11:48.420 --> 11:53.500
it, to Father It and so we feel madigued on that score that he is the majority leader.

11:53.500 --> 11:57.700
Well, let's just let me tell you this, that it was because of your constant and unfailing

11:57.700 --> 12:03.660
championship of the TVA that you were so easily able to convert so many of us to cause

12:03.660 --> 12:05.060
and to keep us under your banner.

12:05.060 --> 12:09.260
Well, of course, Senator Gore and I are very much for the TVA, but that's how you feel

12:09.260 --> 12:11.820
otherwise you wouldn't have been so enthusiastic, Mike.

12:11.820 --> 12:17.540
But resource development and building up our country will be a vital part of the program

12:17.540 --> 12:20.420
of the President and of the Congress.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.420
Very vital part.

12:22.420 --> 12:27.660
In the minute or two remaining, Mike, how about the development of our greats national

12:27.660 --> 12:28.660
parts?

12:28.660 --> 12:35.260
You have a, we have a smokey mountain national part and you have Yellowstone and glacier.

12:35.260 --> 12:39.460
Glacier and others, we need to give them more attention, much is that.

12:39.460 --> 12:40.460
Yes indeed.

12:40.460 --> 12:45.340
Considering more attention, I would hope that the Mission 66 program would be accentuated,

12:45.340 --> 12:48.980
that the amounts of money which must be spent would be put into our parts because they

12:48.980 --> 12:54.380
do represent an investment in which all America can participate and I think that if we do

12:54.380 --> 12:59.700
not undertake a program of this kind that we will be the losers and the results may well

12:59.700 --> 13:02.500
be that the parts will be carried still further.

13:02.500 --> 13:08.020
Well, Mike, we don't have much time remaining, but we've seen that you've been have a package

13:08.020 --> 13:11.980
for the reform of the electoral college of which I'm interested to.

13:11.980 --> 13:13.980
Will that be part of the program?

13:13.980 --> 13:18.660
No, that is my own personal idea, but I think something ought to be done about the electoral

13:18.660 --> 13:22.180
college, something ought to be done about the length and the cost of campaigns and something

13:22.180 --> 13:25.740
ought to be done about the interregnum between the election and the title of president takes

13:25.740 --> 13:26.740
over.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.340
Well, I certainly agree with you and I have been working on that myself as you know for

13:29.340 --> 13:30.340
a number of years.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.860
Well, thank you very much, Senator Manstale.

13:32.860 --> 13:36.980
You are a great leader and a great friend of the people of this nation and of Tennessee.

13:36.980 --> 13:37.980
Asters is a pleasure.

13:37.980 --> 13:41.660
And ladies and gentlemen, until four weeks from now, that's all.

13:41.660 --> 13:42.180
Thank you very much.

13:52.180 --> 14:04.540
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this is the second telecast, bringing you the

14:04.540 --> 14:08.340
news from Washington, which I'm very honored to present.

14:08.340 --> 14:13.780
And on this occasion, we are very happy to have with us the distinguished member of Congress

14:13.780 --> 14:19.020
from Tennessee from the fourth congressional district, the Honorable Joe Evans.

14:19.020 --> 14:23.700
Joe is beginning his eighth term as a member of the House of Representatives.

14:23.700 --> 14:27.500
He is a member of the Appropriations Committee.

14:27.500 --> 14:32.220
And I want to tell all of you people of Tennessee, not only of your fourth district, Joe, but

14:32.220 --> 14:37.980
everyone that you are a very hardworking, effective member of the House of Representatives.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.940
And we certainly are glad to have you here.

14:39.940 --> 14:40.940
Most younger.

14:40.940 --> 14:50.660
Joe, I came up here in 1933 in March for the passage of the lame document to the inauguration

14:50.660 --> 14:52.260
of President Roosevelt.

14:52.260 --> 14:56.260
And of course, we were all here during this current inauguration.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.020
And I haven't talked with you people since then.

14:59.020 --> 15:05.460
During all of the snow and slush and the cold winds, most of us called bad colds.

15:05.460 --> 15:11.140
But I don't think there has been as much enthusiasm or as large a crowd inside of the

15:11.140 --> 15:16.780
cool weather in town as there was for the Mr. Canada's inauguration.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.940
Yes, it was a great outpouring of people's mall over the country.

15:19.940 --> 15:23.820
And we were certainly privileged to have a great number of our friends from Tennessee.

15:23.820 --> 15:27.780
It was truly a great inaugural, great occasion, and we lived through the snow.

15:27.780 --> 15:31.780
And we had three bands from Tennessee, and other states just had one.

15:31.780 --> 15:32.780
So we got to...

15:32.780 --> 15:36.740
Well, ed, John, let me mention a couple of those outstanding bands from the fourth district

15:36.740 --> 15:41.540
of Tennessee from the University of South at Siwani and also the Muffersburg band.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.300
They were very proud of them.

15:43.300 --> 15:48.500
And then he and I won the draw and they had a band in Marstown.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.900
I had promised people in Marstown that, certainly they were very excellent band.

15:52.900 --> 15:59.980
And would be invited to Marstown in the parade when the National Honors last year.

15:59.980 --> 16:01.700
I thought that they only wanted one from one state.

16:01.700 --> 16:06.140
So I got Jigs Donahue, the parade chairman, let them march in place of the Virgin Houses,

16:06.140 --> 16:07.740
which didn't send the band up here.

16:07.740 --> 16:09.740
But Tennessee played a big part.

16:09.740 --> 16:15.860
I had the feeling, Joe, that during inauguration and what's been happening since is quite similar

16:15.860 --> 16:21.060
to the situation in 1933 when President Roosevelt took over.

16:21.060 --> 16:28.420
Of course, there was a tremendous domestic recession and depression at that time.

16:28.420 --> 16:33.020
Roosevelt was not well under the domestic front, but we don't have this bad situation.

16:33.020 --> 16:36.740
But we do have great international problems.

16:36.740 --> 16:42.660
Then as now, it was a time for great leadership, for affirmative action.

16:42.660 --> 16:46.460
And I think our president has been showing that in his inaugural address.

16:46.460 --> 16:49.140
I mean, his message is to the Congress, don't you?

16:49.140 --> 16:52.780
Yes, yes, this is the president delivered a great inaugural address.

16:52.780 --> 16:57.860
And I think all of us at the Congress have been impressed with the great speech which he delivered

16:57.860 --> 16:59.620
before the joint strikes of the Congress.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.180
His first message on the state of the Union.

17:02.180 --> 17:08.820
Well, Joe, I felt at this speech, he stated just as he saw it, without missing any words,

17:08.820 --> 17:12.220
without trying to cover over anything.

17:12.220 --> 17:15.340
The pictures he saw it today, economically.

17:15.340 --> 17:20.620
That is, we have a lot of bad situations that we have to, but they're not hopeless.

17:20.620 --> 17:25.660
And that in the international affairs and among relations to the world, we have lost some

17:25.660 --> 17:26.660
standing.

17:26.660 --> 17:31.300
There has been some deterioration, a fair again, with leadership, with sacrifice that we

17:31.300 --> 17:34.700
can bring about a better condition.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.900
I thought it was a very forthright fine assessment.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.260
And after all, the American people ought to know exactly where we stand.

17:41.260 --> 17:46.140
Well, certainly he discussed domestic issues, but he greatly pointed up our troubled spots

17:46.140 --> 17:50.940
in the world and indicated that America would not be second to the Indian nation in power

17:50.940 --> 17:51.940
and strength.

17:51.940 --> 17:55.500
It was a message of security and national defense.

17:55.500 --> 18:00.180
The President certainly has a precise mind and a factual knowledge of the grasp of things

18:00.180 --> 18:01.180
already.

18:01.180 --> 18:06.580
He's reaching through to the public and his views, offering a program to the Congress.

18:06.580 --> 18:11.620
Well, I thought not only in the state of the Union message, as well as the inaugural message

18:11.620 --> 18:16.540
of his, not only what he had to say, but the force of which he delivered his speech,

18:16.540 --> 18:19.540
the dedication and the cheers he has.

18:19.540 --> 18:25.740
As tos, you know that the President, John F. Kennedy and I were classmates together,

18:25.740 --> 18:30.300
we came to Congress at the same time, and my classmate has now become President.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.300
1946.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.300
1946.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.300
1946.

18:33.300 --> 18:40.100
I was there with you in 1946 and 1947, and I came over to the Senate and your classmate

18:40.100 --> 18:43.660
joined us, and I remember that.

18:43.660 --> 18:47.340
At first session, when you and I served together in the House, I didn't get to see you very

18:47.340 --> 18:48.340
much.

18:48.340 --> 18:50.180
You were campaigning for the Senate.

18:50.180 --> 18:53.420
Well, you know, you have to do that sometimes.

18:53.420 --> 19:02.460
Well, I have a feeling also that somewhere to what we had in 1933 that we have a lot of

19:02.460 --> 19:05.420
new faces around, a lot of young people with vision.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.420
They call them a new frontier.

19:07.420 --> 19:12.260
A new frontier, and who audited sang that song, said, the country was in the best of hands.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.780
Is that David Crocket?

19:13.780 --> 19:14.780
Good day.

19:14.780 --> 19:21.180
Well, I know that there are a lot of fine, capable young men and women who have come into

19:21.180 --> 19:23.180
government service with great dedication.

19:23.180 --> 19:25.020
Many of them making sacrifices.

19:25.020 --> 19:31.260
I feel that by and large, Mr. Kennedy has gotten very good men to advise and work with

19:31.260 --> 19:32.260
them.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.860
Certainly, he has surrounded himself with some very able men.

19:34.860 --> 19:38.100
Even the former President has committed him on his selection of his cabinet and said

19:38.100 --> 19:42.500
that he had been able to attract some of these very outstanding men as his assistants

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
and any staff.

19:43.500 --> 19:47.700
The reason he nominated is Joe Svetler, who used to be General Counselor for the Tennessee

19:47.700 --> 19:51.500
Valley Authority to be chairman of the Federal Power Commission.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.980
And a very significant selection.

19:52.980 --> 19:56.020
I was very pleased that the President selected him to become chairman.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.820
There's a very important commission.

19:57.820 --> 20:01.820
He comes from Nashville, where he's been practicing law since he left the TVA.

20:01.820 --> 20:03.220
And I think he's a fair man.

20:03.220 --> 20:04.220
I think he's forceful.

20:04.220 --> 20:07.060
I think he has the viewpoint of the consumer.

20:07.060 --> 20:10.060
And believe me, we've been needing that viewpoint in the Federal Power Commission.

20:10.060 --> 20:14.300
Well, the landish reporters, you know, or criticize the operation of the Federal Power

20:14.300 --> 20:18.980
Commission among all of the independent agencies as the one who is least functioning properly

20:18.980 --> 20:21.980
in the public interest in the last few years.

20:21.980 --> 20:26.740
It administers the Natural Gas Act and the granting of franchises on the construction

20:26.740 --> 20:28.420
of great power dams throughout the nation.

20:28.420 --> 20:29.820
It's a very important commission.

20:29.820 --> 20:32.620
I think Mr. Svetler will make a very excellent chairman.

20:32.620 --> 20:38.220
But Joe, of course, there have been a whole lot of menus the last few days about the

20:38.220 --> 20:42.980
fight in the House of Representatives over the change in the rules committee.

20:42.980 --> 20:49.060
And you've been right there where it's been taking place, where the fire has been going

20:49.060 --> 20:50.060
on.

20:50.060 --> 20:52.060
So tell us about what the shootings all of them are.

20:52.060 --> 20:57.260
Well, as you know, at the beginning of each new session of the Congress, both the House

20:57.260 --> 21:02.420
and the Senate adopt rules of procedure for their individual bodies.

21:02.420 --> 21:07.420
The House has already adopted for the 87th Congress the same rules of procedure as were

21:07.420 --> 21:09.060
employed in 86th Congress.

21:09.060 --> 21:14.340
But while adopting the same rules, we have been evaluated and considering the operations

21:14.340 --> 21:18.980
of the committee, whether it has been read through the functioning, the real issue and

21:18.980 --> 21:24.540
the rules committee vote was whether or not the elected representatives of all the people,

21:24.540 --> 21:28.700
the entire House should have a right to work its will, where they should have a right to vote

21:28.700 --> 21:34.300
on legislation, or where they're a very small group or a handful, a very small minority

21:34.300 --> 21:35.620
who votes at 12th.

21:35.620 --> 21:40.660
Well, even in 2003, with their vote could tie up legislation, it has been charges that

21:40.660 --> 21:45.500
bills have been pigeonholed, it has been a roadblock, and even vetoed.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.740
And certain legislation has not been permitted to reach the floor of the House.

21:49.740 --> 21:54.380
Now, let us take a bill that has been debated for weeks and for months before a standing

21:54.380 --> 21:57.580
legislative committee of the Congress.

21:57.580 --> 22:00.700
After the bill has been discussed, public hearings have been had, and the majority of the

22:00.700 --> 22:06.740
membership vote upon a bill, then the function of the rules committee is to orderly proceed

22:06.740 --> 22:10.820
onto the floor with the majors for the House to debate and consider.

22:10.820 --> 22:11.820
If, historic—

22:11.820 --> 22:14.020
I mean, the time and the day and—

22:14.020 --> 22:18.400
Yes, and the numbers of bills that will flow onto the floor, they schedule them as old

22:18.400 --> 22:20.740
traffic, where to pass along.

22:20.740 --> 22:26.820
The rules committee is not supposed to be a dead end street, it's supposed to be a committee

22:26.820 --> 22:32.740
to orderly permit legislation to come onto the floor for debate and consideration.

22:32.740 --> 22:37.620
Now, there has been instances in which maybe there are many bills that shouldn't pass.

22:37.620 --> 22:42.460
I know in the past I have voted for a rule to bring a bill on the floor to debate it,

22:42.460 --> 22:43.460
which is democratic.

22:43.460 --> 22:49.060
It certainly is democratic to have a free discussion of a measure, even controversial measures.

22:49.060 --> 22:54.980
But then after the bill was debated, after it was possibly amended and made noxious,

22:54.980 --> 22:58.100
I would vote against it on final passage.

22:58.100 --> 23:04.660
But the real issue is whether the full elected representatives should have a right to debate

23:04.660 --> 23:09.260
and to the vote upon legislation, or whether a few of the very small minority should block

23:09.260 --> 23:13.220
legislation and deny the House the right to exercise its will.

23:13.220 --> 23:17.420
Speaker Rayman said, it's certainly the House, the elected representatives of the people,

23:17.420 --> 23:20.660
should have the right to vote upon legislation.

23:20.660 --> 23:26.140
The rules committee is not a committee on legislation, it's an administrative committee,

23:26.140 --> 23:30.260
it's an oral of the leadership historically, it goes with the leadership.

23:30.260 --> 23:36.500
Well, Joe, thank you very much for telling us about the issue and certainly if we're going

23:36.500 --> 23:41.740
to get a new program over the entire membership of the House of Representatives, all they

23:41.740 --> 23:42.740
have a chance to do.

23:42.740 --> 23:43.740
Well, we're down.

23:43.740 --> 23:48.580
My committee on appropriations has 50 members and the membership of this committee has been

23:48.580 --> 23:50.420
increased since I have been here.

23:50.420 --> 23:53.740
The rules committee used to recompose to five members.

23:53.740 --> 23:54.740
Later it was nine.

23:54.740 --> 23:59.580
At another time there were 14 and in the last few years they've settled on 12, which is

23:59.580 --> 24:03.020
an even number conducive to a tie vote, six to six.

24:03.020 --> 24:07.940
So there have been a lot of tie votes and legislation is not reached the floor.

24:07.940 --> 24:12.900
So it's nothing unusual to change a committee of the Congress.

24:12.900 --> 24:17.820
As a matter of fact, we adopted a resolution allowing the speaker and the minority leader

24:17.820 --> 24:21.220
to adjust the ratio of members of the committee.

24:21.220 --> 24:27.220
This committee had been composed of 12 members, now it will be composed of 15 with three additions,

24:27.220 --> 24:28.940
two Democrats and one Republican.

24:28.940 --> 24:33.740
By the way, the speaker had just announced, as you know, the two new Democratic members

24:33.740 --> 24:35.060
of the committee.

24:35.060 --> 24:40.820
They are a Congressman called Elliott of Alabama and BF Sisk of California.

24:40.820 --> 24:43.620
They're both of them I know them, they're very substantial.

24:43.620 --> 24:46.220
They're very sound, man, very good men.

24:46.220 --> 24:51.020
Well, in the President's State of the Union message, he of course couldn't go into details

24:51.020 --> 24:55.300
about all of the things he was going to do and there were some little criticism on that

24:55.300 --> 24:59.820
part, but he's been acting very rapidly since that time.

24:59.820 --> 25:06.300
He's issued for instance an executive order, expanding the surplus food distribution

25:06.300 --> 25:11.780
principally by, and then also setting up food staff areas.

25:11.780 --> 25:13.660
Now I hope that we'll get one in Tennessee.

25:14.180 --> 25:19.420
I thought another very important thing he did was that the community facilities program,

25:19.420 --> 25:25.420
which has only been applicable to sewers and water districts and water and gas has been

25:25.420 --> 25:27.900
expanded so as to be applicable to anything else.

25:27.900 --> 25:33.180
And incidentally, Joe, I've introduced a bill to enlarge the community facilities program

25:33.180 --> 25:39.100
so as to have a revolving fund of $1 billion to be loaned on worthwhile projects that

25:39.100 --> 25:42.780
a rate of interest, one for the above, what the government has to pay for its money.

25:42.860 --> 25:47.500
As to say as a representative of a lot of our very excellent to small towns, I know that they

25:47.500 --> 25:53.660
have benefited from this program for municipal water works, sidewalks, for libraries, for hospital

25:53.660 --> 25:56.780
construction and various municipal and community improvements.

25:56.780 --> 26:01.020
Right. These are things that not only need to be done, they have been many improvements.

26:01.020 --> 26:02.860
They have been a loan program.

26:02.860 --> 26:07.100
That's a loan program, but they've certainly given employment to a great many people.

26:07.740 --> 26:12.780
And also, we've been housing starts have been almost dried up so that President has

26:12.780 --> 26:18.860
lowered the interest rate by one quarter of a percent or one half a percent, no one fourth of

26:18.860 --> 26:23.740
a percent on FHA home loans, which ought to help in that respect.

26:25.900 --> 26:30.940
Then I think Joe that President was wise and following the suggestion of the joint

26:31.020 --> 26:37.980
chiefs of staff and revoking the order about the dependence on having to be sent back.

26:37.980 --> 26:43.580
I think that by trying to get them to restrict travel, tourism abroad and to buy their capital

26:43.580 --> 26:44.540
equipment here in the country.

26:44.540 --> 26:49.020
Let me say, Esther, so that I would certainly be for cutting down on some expenditures abroad,

26:49.020 --> 26:53.020
but not at the expense of the American soldier and the American servicemen and their families.

26:53.020 --> 26:57.500
Well, I was over the NATO parliamentarians conference shortly after this order went into effect,

26:57.500 --> 27:01.100
and they backed on the morale of our soldiers, which evidently could be seen.

27:03.340 --> 27:06.460
Certainly must be other ways where the same result can be accomplished.

27:07.340 --> 27:12.220
But Joe, I want to tell you how good it is to have you over here with us, and we are going to have a

27:13.340 --> 27:16.540
very exciting and I know a very useful session of Congress.

27:17.500 --> 27:23.580
I hope that one of these days we can get you back to joining reporting to people of tennis.

27:23.580 --> 27:25.420
Yes, yes, yes, you are very nice to invite me.

27:26.380 --> 27:31.500
Ladies and gentlemen, until four weeks from today, and we will bring you another report,

27:32.060 --> 27:39.500
that's all. Thank you very much.

27:39.820 --> 27:56.940
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of tennis see, today we are very happy to have on this program,

27:57.580 --> 28:03.260
and I'm very proud to be able to introduce to all of you the distinguished Attorney General of the

28:03.260 --> 28:10.540
United States, Robert Kennedy. And I want to say in that connection that I think that Mr.

28:10.540 --> 28:15.100
Kennedy is making an excellent Attorney General. I was proud to support him.

28:17.020 --> 28:23.020
I don't want to say too many things to embarrass him here in his presence, but as all of you know,

28:23.020 --> 28:30.700
he is 35 years old and was the youngest Attorney General that we've had in more than 100 years.

28:31.420 --> 28:34.940
I don't know what happened to that fellow Bob that was younger than you.

28:36.940 --> 28:41.100
But then the event I think that Attorney General Kennedy is surrounding himself with

28:41.740 --> 28:48.620
very able assistance that he is going to be a determined and active and courageous Attorney General.

28:49.500 --> 28:54.780
And I think we'll be mighted proud of the record that he is going to make or that he is making.

28:55.420 --> 29:02.300
We have a special interest in one person and your immediate staff, Mr. Attorney General,

29:02.300 --> 29:07.660
that's John Seagunfailer. John was the assistant city editor of the National Tennis

29:07.660 --> 29:14.220
See and how did you get mixed up with John? Well, we were investigating some three years ago,

29:14.220 --> 29:18.620
I guess Senator, we were, I was counsel as Senator Rackett's Committee and we were investigating

29:18.700 --> 29:25.420
a situation down in Tennessee involving some corruption and dishonesty involving a judge in

29:25.420 --> 29:30.380
Tennessee and John Seagunfailer was the one that first brought it to our attention as well as

29:31.100 --> 29:35.900
followed shortly afterwards by a number of your other citizens there and we made an investigation.

29:37.180 --> 29:42.380
He held some hearings and he was very instrumental in uncovering information which was

29:42.380 --> 29:47.260
ultimately revealed at our hearings and then later on you know, you're legislated, you picked it up

29:47.260 --> 29:54.860
and the judge was impeached and I think that he covered that and was very helpful to them also.

29:54.860 --> 30:01.500
So I get to know him then and he worked in the campaign with us. He was my administrative assistant

30:01.500 --> 30:06.860
and when I was out speaking in the country he was really running the whole campaign and then so

30:06.860 --> 30:12.940
after I was point to this position I asked him if he'd come and be my assistant here. So I think

30:12.940 --> 30:17.420
that I'm very fortunate in having him. Well we all think that John is a very able man. I know he's

30:17.420 --> 30:24.700
working awfully hard. Well I want to say folks that I think the new program our president Kennedy is

30:25.420 --> 30:30.060
getting started off fine. There's a lot of activity. There are many plans to do many things that are

30:30.060 --> 30:35.580
necessary such as the area redevelopment bill. He's gotten food out to the needy. We have

30:36.860 --> 30:41.100
programs that will soon be before the Senate in connection with raising the minimum wage and

30:41.100 --> 30:48.780
extending the coverage assistance to the aged medical assistance. So the things are really humming

30:48.780 --> 30:53.020
in Washington. Of course there's a lot of confusion and difficulty and the transition from one

30:53.020 --> 30:59.660
administration to another. A model sometime our president Kennedy stands all of the strain that must

30:59.660 --> 31:07.820
be placed upon him during this very difficult time. Bob I know you see your brother John very often

31:08.540 --> 31:13.260
positive feeling. Well I think very well as I believe you know Senator I don't think there's

31:13.260 --> 31:20.540
anything that is more difficult than an arduous campaign. You went through the campaign and

31:20.540 --> 31:26.060
Wisconsin I believe four years ago and we went through it just a year ago and I don't think anything

31:26.060 --> 31:31.820
could be as tough as that and then the campaign no hamps you're traveling all around the country making

31:32.780 --> 31:38.620
as many as 20 or 22 speeches a day and sleeping four or five hours that this actually

31:39.420 --> 31:45.660
is less difficult physically than that kind of an operation. And then you mean being president is

31:45.660 --> 31:51.100
less difficult in all this campaign? Certainly physically. They're all traveling and all that

31:51.100 --> 31:59.340
strain of making speeches continuously. So I think that he's getting extremely healthy and very

31:59.340 --> 32:03.340
good position to make some of these decisions. I think health makes a big difference if you're

32:03.340 --> 32:08.700
healthy. You can meet these problems and difficulties much easier and I've never seen his health better

32:08.700 --> 32:16.460
and it's been over the period of the last year or so and as I say I think that it's not a great

32:16.460 --> 32:21.820
deal different than what he's been through in the past. Well I must say that when Senator Gore and I

32:21.820 --> 32:28.380
went down to see him last week at time when President Jackson's portrait was put back up in the

32:28.380 --> 32:36.620
conference room that he certainly looked well and very keen and interested in anxious to get

32:36.620 --> 32:42.540
all of the ideas he could. That's a wonderful picture I think. Yes I think it is it should have

32:42.540 --> 32:49.580
been up on the wall all the time. I have a very interesting letter that I obtained an auction some

32:49.580 --> 32:57.340
years ago of President Jackson that he wrote just before the battle in New Orleans to his wife

32:58.060 --> 33:03.580
telling about the positions of the British and what he anticipated for the future. Well that's

33:03.580 --> 33:09.100
a very precious letter. Yes and a very touching letter too. Very touching. On any time that you

33:09.820 --> 33:13.740
don't have some precious place to keep it I know the Hermitage would be glad to have it on there

33:14.380 --> 33:19.260
among our precious documents. I think we have a state library that has a collection of

33:19.580 --> 33:25.900
Andrew Jackson's letters and papers and no doubt you've seen it down. I did I visited there and I've

33:25.900 --> 33:35.100
visited the Hermitage. I've got a also that was a very important moment over to me a

33:35.100 --> 33:42.300
gavill that was sent by the governor which is taken from the desk of President Jackson when he

33:42.300 --> 33:46.940
practiced when he was living in Nashville Tennessee. Yeah I believe Governor Beefard Ellington

33:47.020 --> 33:52.380
brought that up to Washington. Yeah very nice. I have that on my desk at the turn. Do you ever have to

33:52.380 --> 33:56.620
use it to keep your associates in order? I don't know. John seconds all occasionally but I'll

33:56.620 --> 34:03.180
leave him there. I know some paper that you're a wonderful assistant, Byron, Wizard White. Yes.

34:03.900 --> 34:07.900
He's got a little too nervous and has gone to the hospital. You're late. He said some

34:07.900 --> 34:13.580
difficulty with his stomach but yeah. Well he's a wonderful fellow. One thing I think about

34:14.540 --> 34:20.940
you and your outstanding brother and all of the candidates you have the tremendous energy

34:20.940 --> 34:25.980
and interest in the power to relax which is what anyone in public office needs.

34:26.860 --> 34:32.220
Well do you mind if I we talk a little bit about how things are going? How do you feel that the

34:32.220 --> 34:37.100
new program is going generally? The new frontier? Well I think that we're making a good deal of progress

34:37.660 --> 34:42.220
the senator I think of course it's early yet. It's only been I think it's 40 days from

34:43.660 --> 34:51.660
the since denomination. I think that the President shown by the various programs that he's offered

34:51.660 --> 34:56.220
that he feels it's necessary and essential that the country move again in many areas.

34:56.860 --> 35:02.620
And here in the United States in our relationship with other countries and he's trying to take some

35:02.620 --> 35:10.140
steps to get some of these programs accepted by Congress and accepted by the American people.

35:10.140 --> 35:14.460
And I think there's some good deal of progress as being made. Of course I think that we all

35:14.460 --> 35:20.780
have everybody appreciates the fact that before great many things can be done the cabinet members

35:20.780 --> 35:26.140
have to have hearings before the committees and have to be confirmed and I believe that all the

35:26.140 --> 35:31.340
cabinet members and practically all of the people who have to come before the senate to be confirmed

35:32.140 --> 35:36.460
have been confirmed. That's correct. Yes. And I don't believe today that any of them have been turned

35:36.460 --> 35:41.420
down. No they are. Which speaks not yet well for the people who are being selected. Well I

35:41.420 --> 35:48.940
missed your attorney general or Bob if I may call you that and tell us I have the feeling that

35:50.380 --> 35:56.940
that the attorney general's department of justice is really humming and that things are going

35:57.020 --> 36:01.900
and everybody's working hard with the determination to enforce the law and to improve the enforcement

36:01.900 --> 36:07.980
of the law. Tell us something about your plans. How about in the antitrust field where we

36:08.860 --> 36:14.860
have had a shocking experience recently, finding the some officials in the electrical manufacturing

36:14.860 --> 36:20.780
industry, fixing prices, talking things over violating the law and they've now some of them have

36:20.780 --> 36:29.820
been sent to penal institution for and upon their plea of guilty. What about that? Well they're

36:29.820 --> 36:35.660
going to be a number of cases that are going to arise out of those cases, Senator. And you are

36:35.660 --> 36:42.140
well aware of it because I think that was first initially developed by your committee the facts

36:42.140 --> 36:48.140
that which ultimately led up to their indictment and their conviction. There were sales for instance

36:48.140 --> 36:55.420
to TBA where we're shown that the sales were handled through rig bidding. The contractors getting

36:55.420 --> 37:00.220
together amongst themselves and determining what the prices should be, who should get the bid.

37:00.860 --> 37:08.060
The government's now going to take action. I would think within about six weeks to try to

37:09.580 --> 37:14.620
collect damages from the electro-compination and the areas in which they were defrauded. One of

37:14.620 --> 37:19.740
the major areas will be in the TBA but there will be a number of other government agencies whose

37:19.740 --> 37:24.620
contracts will be studied to determine whether we can also bring some action at the federal level.

37:26.300 --> 37:33.980
We will continue to be working in this whole area of price fixing. I think it has a very important

37:33.980 --> 37:39.900
effect on local communities. This is last electrical case at a nationwide effect but there are many

37:39.900 --> 37:46.620
other similar cases which have an effect on a state or on a particular city or in a community.

37:46.620 --> 37:51.820
We are investigating a number of those and I might say that we are extremely appreciative of

37:52.620 --> 37:57.740
help and cooperation and the very important leads that we have received from your committee because

37:57.740 --> 38:02.940
I think that that kind of information that you've given to the executive branch of the government

38:02.940 --> 38:10.060
has been almost essential for us to proceed in these areas and I would hope that you will

38:10.060 --> 38:14.940
in turn be continuing your hearing so that you have two branches of the government can work together

38:14.940 --> 38:19.660
in this manner. Thank you, Bob. I've been the chairman of the Antitrust and Monopoly subcommittee for

38:20.620 --> 38:25.740
a number of years and never have we received better cooperation or more sympathetic

38:27.260 --> 38:32.540
attitude from anyone than we have from you as the new Attorney General. We did find that

38:32.540 --> 38:38.780
beds out to the TVA or even though companies might be in different parts of the United States have

38:38.780 --> 38:44.060
different labor costs even though they were secret beds that strangely they were identical

38:44.860 --> 38:48.940
and that they were so often they would be a rotation so as to give the bed to some particular

38:48.940 --> 38:54.540
company. I think the public ought to understand that this is very destructive of our free enterprise

38:54.540 --> 39:00.540
system. It's a kind of thing that we cannot tolerate and we're going to work out along with you

39:00.540 --> 39:06.140
and further investigations but this might be going on in other lands of industry and I suppose

39:06.140 --> 39:14.380
that you and we will be looking at this also. Yes, yes. You made a great record as a General

39:14.380 --> 39:19.340
Counsel or Chief Counsel of the Senate Records Committee headed up by Senator John McTweller in the

39:19.340 --> 39:26.860
Arkansas. I admired your courage and your energy and thoroughness in carrying out the work of

39:26.860 --> 39:33.740
that committee. I've been very pleased to know about your attitude and your determination to

39:33.740 --> 39:40.220
do something to try to rid the nation of the at least check or stop where we can influence

39:40.220 --> 39:46.300
the criminal element. Tell us something about that, Mr. Attorney General. Well, I think that the

39:46.300 --> 39:52.940
situation since 1950 when you first developed these matters has become even more critical.

39:53.580 --> 40:00.300
And I think that the is necessary and essential at the executive branch of the government step

40:00.300 --> 40:09.100
in with a forceful program. I think rising the steps that will be taken rising out of the conference

40:09.100 --> 40:15.180
that you and Senator Cullen and Jay Aguhover, the FBI and I had the Department of Justice

40:15.180 --> 40:20.380
several weeks ago that there will be important steps taken. I don't think that this problem will

40:20.380 --> 40:26.860
be solved overnight as both of us recognize. But I think we can take certain steps which will

40:28.460 --> 40:33.180
make a major difference in many areas of the United States to stamp out organized crime.

40:33.740 --> 40:38.460
Well, I know something about your plans and I'm certain that great benefits will come from it.

40:38.460 --> 40:44.300
And I know that people all over the country who are interested in stamping out organized crime

40:44.300 --> 40:49.740
better law enforcement are going to be encouraged. And after all the activity of people at the local

40:49.740 --> 40:53.980
level is accounts very, very much doesn't it? That's certainly does.

40:54.940 --> 41:00.140
Well, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Kennedy has been down to Tennessee on many occasions.

41:02.220 --> 41:08.780
I know that many of you have met him and seen him. I know you will follow his career with a great

41:08.780 --> 41:13.740
deal of interest. And let me say again that I think when the history of this administration has

41:13.740 --> 41:19.100
written, I think that we will all record that he has been one of the great Attorney General's in

41:19.100 --> 41:24.460
the history of our nation. We thank you very much Bob for the long program and see you again soon.

41:24.460 --> 41:27.660
Thank you, sir. That's all for now.
