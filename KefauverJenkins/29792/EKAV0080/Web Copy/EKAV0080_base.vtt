00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we may be heading into another wave of inflation.

00:08.880 --> 00:14.520
This week several steel companies led by Armco, the nation's seventh largest producer,

00:14.520 --> 00:18.480
announced price increases in steel averaging $4 a ton.

00:18.480 --> 00:23.080
In justifications for their action, the steel companies take the position that a price

00:23.080 --> 00:28.920
increases needed in order to offset the increase in cost rising from wage increases granted

00:28.920 --> 00:34.400
under the third year of the contract with the United States steel workers of America.

00:34.400 --> 00:39.480
Follardaire such a need is highly questionable to me, based on our experiences in the

00:39.480 --> 00:44.160
Nanny Monopoly subcommittee of which I am chairman, which had a painstaking and thorough

00:44.160 --> 00:46.840
investigation of steel.

00:46.840 --> 00:52.280
Over the long run, most of the increases are offset by the increase in labor productivity,

00:52.280 --> 00:57.600
but the best evidence of the need or lack of need of the steel companies for a price increase

00:57.600 --> 01:00.840
can be gained by examining their profit figures.

01:00.840 --> 01:06.440
The big question is whether the United States steel corporation, the nation's largest producer,

01:06.440 --> 01:08.640
is they're going to raise its prices.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.720
If it raises its prices following the lead of the smaller producers, then this price increase

01:13.720 --> 01:18.080
will stick if it doesn't, the others will quickly get back into land.

01:18.080 --> 01:24.280
For the first half of this year, United States steel profit rate after taxes on stockholders'

01:24.280 --> 01:27.960
investment was 9% on an annual basis.

01:27.960 --> 01:35.360
This is about the same level as it enjoyed in such good years as 1924, 528, 49, and 54.

01:35.360 --> 01:41.520
And it has managed to do this while operating at only a little more than half capacity.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.600
Whether these figures indicate a need for a price increase is highly dubious.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.920
Above and beyond the effect of this increase on steel and direct steel buyers, however,

01:51.920 --> 01:55.040
will be as effect upon the economy as a whole.

01:55.040 --> 01:59.280
For nearly a year now, the nation has been experiencing a recession.

01:59.280 --> 02:03.120
In recent weeks, there have been some indications that we are pulling out of it.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.680
But take it from me.

02:04.680 --> 02:09.880
If there is another wave of inflation, the buyers will let their purse strings again, and

02:09.880 --> 02:13.520
the nation will plunge back into a worse recession.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.440
For weeks, I have been urging the President to bring the leaders of steel in the steel industry

02:18.440 --> 02:24.760
and of the steel union together to work out some wage price formula that would prevent this.

02:24.760 --> 02:29.040
I personally wide-rod your blower the head of the U.S. steel and Dave McDonald the head

02:29.040 --> 02:33.160
of the union asking if they would attend such a meeting.

02:33.160 --> 02:38.320
Mr. McDonald said he would and Mr. Blower said he didn't say he wouldn't.

02:38.320 --> 02:43.020
This is the time for statesmanship on the part of both labor and industry, and is the

02:43.020 --> 02:47.280
time for statesmanship on the part of the President of the United States.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.260
He can and he should exert the leadership which is office demands of its occupant when

02:52.260 --> 02:54.960
the good of the nation is involved.

02:54.960 --> 03:00.080
Let me say also that I think labor probably would and ought to be willing to make some

03:00.080 --> 03:05.080
concession, some deferment of perhaps some benefits in order to hold a price, wage

03:05.080 --> 03:08.000
land, and to prevent inflation.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.480
Now let's turn to other subjects.

03:10.480 --> 03:14.360
Congress is rushing a very hard toward adjournment.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.560
Committees have been working early and late.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.960
There have been long and arduous floor sessions, but Brazels are being achieved.

03:21.960 --> 03:26.460
I'm happy that the appropriation bill containing the planning and site money for the new federal

03:26.460 --> 03:32.360
building at Memphis was agreed to after a conference between the House and the Senate.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.840
The city will be able to go ahead with its plans for this beautiful new building and the

03:36.840 --> 03:39.200
new Civic Center now.

03:39.200 --> 03:44.120
This week the House of Representatives reported the TVA's self-financing bill, that is the

03:44.120 --> 03:49.040
committee did, in the same manner that the Senate passed it last year.

03:49.040 --> 03:53.280
A spirited tour fight is anticipated on this bill in the House.

03:53.280 --> 03:59.440
Nevertheless we simply must have this legislation this year for the benefit of the TVA.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.280
Both the Senate and the House Judiciary Committees are again working on the omnibus

04:03.280 --> 04:09.120
Judship Bill, which authorizes three new federal judges for Tennessee.

04:09.120 --> 04:14.560
This bill also is vitally important and I'm certainly doing all I can to help it alone.

04:14.560 --> 04:20.840
A highly important measure, the Tennessee River Basin Water Pollution Control Compact,

04:20.840 --> 04:22.160
passed the Senate.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.360
This bill had previously passed the House.

04:24.360 --> 04:28.360
There are differences in the two versions which are now being worked out.

04:28.360 --> 04:32.960
But it seems certain that this bill will now become law and Tennessee and its six neighboring

04:32.960 --> 04:37.880
states can go ahead with the job of cleaning up the waters of the river, which is needed

04:37.880 --> 04:40.360
to be done for a long, long time.

04:40.360 --> 04:51.640
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

04:51.640 --> 04:56.320
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the United States this weekend is in the midst

04:56.320 --> 05:00.080
of a most dangerous situation since Korea.

05:00.080 --> 05:05.920
As you know, the United States Marines today are in the little nation of Lebanon, ordered

05:05.920 --> 05:11.960
there by President Eisenhower following a rebellion in Iraq, which is here and rioting

05:11.960 --> 05:15.480
tensions in Lebanon itself.

05:15.480 --> 05:21.200
The United States' six fleet is operating in the Mediterranean waters under battle conditions.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.880
Army troops have been flowing into the Middle East from Europe.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.920
United States forces are on a worldwide alert.

05:27.920 --> 05:33.480
Personally, I have grave misgivings about the wisdom of the original decision to send in

05:33.480 --> 05:35.600
United States troops.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.880
On the day that the President made this decision, I was asked for comment, and this is what

05:39.880 --> 05:41.200
I said.

05:41.200 --> 05:46.040
I would have wished that the President could have waited for a meeting of the Security Council

05:46.040 --> 05:50.880
and for consultation with our allies before sending the Marines to Lebanon.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.680
I think there would have been less chance of uniting the Arab world against us had we

05:55.680 --> 05:58.800
allowed the Security Council to act first.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.680
I have grave misgivings about the wisdom of what was done.

06:02.680 --> 06:07.680
However, the presence of Marines in Lebanon is now a fact, and therefore the nation is

06:07.680 --> 06:12.880
committed, and little can be accomplished by debating the wisdom of this action.

06:12.880 --> 06:16.280
And that's what I said on the day this was done.

06:16.280 --> 06:21.600
The events of the week have shown that we did indeed arouse the hour of the Muslim world.

06:21.600 --> 06:27.160
Russia is now playing the role of protector of Arab nationalism, a role which is totally

06:27.160 --> 06:33.520
insincere, for international communism, the enemy of nationalism everywhere to play,

06:33.520 --> 06:39.240
but one which has popularity among newly emerging nationalists of the Middle East.

06:39.240 --> 06:44.280
On the other hand, the support of the British and the French has been forthcoming, and I

06:44.280 --> 06:49.840
should add that everything that was done was completely legal under international law.

06:49.840 --> 06:54.520
Our aid was requested by a member nation of the Baghdad Pact.

06:54.520 --> 06:59.520
This weekend should be one of prayer that the great crises will pass without enlarging

06:59.520 --> 07:05.200
into a conflict of migration which will sweep the whole Middle East and lead the war.

07:05.200 --> 07:11.000
We can only pray and hope and remain courageous in the face of grave, grave danger.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.960
On the other side of the Mediterranean and Europe, I attended a very successful meeting last

07:15.960 --> 07:17.280
weekend.

07:17.280 --> 07:22.160
As I told you on this program last week, the executive committee of the NATO Parliament

07:22.160 --> 07:28.240
arians conference held a meeting in Paris with very distinguished private citizens from

07:28.240 --> 07:34.080
all of the NATO countries to make plans for the Congress next year, which results from

07:34.080 --> 07:39.920
a resolution that I sponsored at the last November session of the parliamentarians.

07:39.920 --> 07:45.960
We decided that the Congress would be held in London in June of next year, the 10th anniversary

07:45.960 --> 07:47.440
of NATO.

07:47.440 --> 07:52.560
The British government has issued the invitation and will be the official host.

07:52.560 --> 07:57.160
Meanwhile in each nation, we will make plans for securing delegations from among the private

07:57.160 --> 08:02.640
citizens themselves to attend this conference and to give their governments the benefit of

08:02.640 --> 08:04.400
their ideas and advice.

08:04.400 --> 08:10.760
We want to make this an occasion for talking and thinking about NATO throughout the 15 NATO

08:10.760 --> 08:12.480
nations.

08:12.480 --> 08:19.400
After a passing event, I am more convinced than ever that citizens in a democracy such

08:19.400 --> 08:24.800
as ours and such as prevails among the great majority of the NATO nations ought to have

08:24.800 --> 08:29.640
some form in which they can get together and in which they can bring their ideas to play

08:29.640 --> 08:33.000
on the great overriding problems of our time.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.320
The diplomats and those of us in government have no monopoly on ideas in this field.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.200
This Congress will make that very thing possible.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.240
Finally, I want to report to you that the Senate this week took up the matter of the extension

08:46.240 --> 08:48.560
of the reciprocal trade program.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.040
I supported the five-year extension.

08:51.040 --> 08:55.920
I have long thought that we would do much better in international trade if the world traders

08:55.920 --> 09:01.400
knew that our policies would be stable for a longer period of time and has been possible

09:01.400 --> 09:03.680
under the short extensions.

09:03.680 --> 09:08.560
This is particularly important in view of the present conditions and the rapid development

09:08.560 --> 09:13.920
of the European common market, which will be negotiating with the world on long-range

09:13.920 --> 09:19.120
programs and which will supply considerable competition to the United States in world

09:19.120 --> 09:20.120
markets.

09:20.120 --> 09:24.440
I believe that experience under the five-year extension would prove most beneficial to

09:24.440 --> 09:26.400
us as a nation.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.920
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

09:38.560 --> 09:46.680
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the Senate this week considered one of the

09:46.680 --> 09:51.880
most important single pieces of legislation to come before Congress, and so far as it

09:51.880 --> 09:55.560
affects Tennessee, it was the foreign bill.

09:55.560 --> 10:01.240
No one will pretend that the bill we considered is designed to solve all the problems of agriculture.

10:01.240 --> 10:06.640
The bill dealt with only three commodities, cotton, rice and corn, but it was very vital

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
to the cotton farmers.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.960
If this bill is not finally enacted into law, Tennessee will have a reduction of more

10:12.960 --> 10:16.000
than 20% in cotton acreage.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.520
This would mean that a lot of farmers, particularly the smaller ones, would have to go out of business.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.820
It would mean a further loss of business for the smaller cities and towns, which have

10:25.820 --> 10:31.240
suffered enough as a result of the loss of business due to the soil bank and to the unusual

10:31.240 --> 10:34.520
amount of water particularly in West Tennessee.

10:34.520 --> 10:40.200
If the bill is finally enacted into law, Tennessee will receive an allotment of 600,000 acres.

10:40.200 --> 10:45.760
Furthermore, the bill prevents the cutting of acreage to the small cotton farmer to a

10:45.760 --> 10:48.160
point where he cannot survive.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.640
It reduces, says that he cannot reduce him to more than 10 acres.

10:52.640 --> 10:57.240
And it permits the planting of additional acres if the farm owner voluntarily accepts

10:57.240 --> 10:59.760
a cut in price support.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.960
This lighter provision will make cotton competitive in world markets.

11:03.960 --> 11:09.480
While other phases of agriculture needed legislation, I supported this bill without amendments,

11:09.480 --> 11:15.880
because I think these other phases should be taken care of in separate pieces of legislation.

11:15.880 --> 11:19.920
We must be practical in an emergency situation such as this.

11:19.920 --> 11:24.000
We have to pass a bill that will eventually be signed by the president.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.560
We have passed one bill this year that was vetoed by him.

11:27.560 --> 11:32.080
I believe this one will be signed if the house passes it, and while I'm certainly not

11:32.080 --> 11:36.960
completely satisfied with this bill, I would rather have it than nothing.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.320
Well I wanted to talk with you about another subject this week.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.560
As our thoughts and prayers continue to be turned toward the hope of a restoration of

11:44.560 --> 11:50.400
real peace in the Middle East, the Senate this week took a long step forward toward the

11:50.400 --> 11:54.440
establishment of a body that might bring order into the world.

11:54.440 --> 11:59.520
We passed a concurrent resolution urging the establishment of a permanent United Nations

11:59.520 --> 12:01.560
security force.

12:01.560 --> 12:05.320
There's a little background on this resolution with being ordered.

12:05.320 --> 12:11.280
On August 8th last year, the Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 15, which had been introduced

12:11.280 --> 12:16.800
to preceding January by several senators, including myself, under the principal sponsorship

12:16.800 --> 12:20.520
of Senator Sparkman of our neighboring state of Alabama.

12:20.520 --> 12:25.720
This resolution welcomed the establishment of a United Nations emergency force as a result

12:25.720 --> 12:28.400
of the Suez Canal crisis.

12:28.400 --> 12:33.080
We'd like to ask to express the sense of the Senate that first the force of a similar

12:33.080 --> 12:37.320
character should be made a permanent arm of the United Nations.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.760
Second it should be made up of units furnished by members of the UN other than permanent

12:41.760 --> 12:44.440
members of the Security Council.

12:44.440 --> 12:50.320
And third consideration should be given for assignments to volunteers other than nationals

12:50.320 --> 12:54.600
of permanent members of the Security Council to serve with this force.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.760
And for the expenses of the force would be met like all other regular expenses of the

12:58.760 --> 12:59.760
United Nations.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.000
Well, what were the results of this resolution?

13:03.000 --> 13:07.160
Like so many other worthwhile things that wasn't followed through, the attitude of the

13:07.160 --> 13:12.200
United States delegation to the UN was that it was a good idea, but that it would cost

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
too much.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.800
Now, friends, this is another case of short-sighted economy.

13:16.800 --> 13:24.320
Today, we're supporting the Marines in Lebanon, backed up by the six fleet lying off shore.

13:24.320 --> 13:29.240
The cost of that operation I suspect will be far or far more in dollars than would be

13:29.240 --> 13:33.480
our contribution for many, many years to the Security Force.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.760
The cost and goodwill in the Middle East, the political repercussions of the step we have

13:37.760 --> 13:41.640
had to take with the Marines, cannot be calculated.

13:41.640 --> 13:47.000
In this troubled area, the presence of an international Security Force would be one thing, whereas

13:47.000 --> 13:51.560
the presence of the armed nationals of a Western nation is quite another.

13:51.560 --> 13:55.680
This week, the Senate repeated its resolution of last year with one difference.

13:55.680 --> 13:59.840
The resolution was passed, that we passed, as the same as the one that I have described,

13:59.840 --> 14:01.280
which we passed last year.

14:01.280 --> 14:06.320
But this time, it is a concurrent resolution, which means that the House also will have

14:06.320 --> 14:08.760
an opportunity to join with us.

14:08.760 --> 14:14.040
Now, I believe that the House also will adopt this resolution, or it has nonpartisan support.

14:14.040 --> 14:18.360
Of course, the establishment of such a force will not solve all of our problems.

14:18.360 --> 14:23.320
Russia still will have the right of veto, but it is a long step in the right direction.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.920
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

14:26.920 --> 14:40.320
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we have some bad news this week.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.720
We may be heading into another wave of inflation.

14:43.720 --> 14:49.840
This week, several steel companies led by Armco, the nation's seventh largest producer,

14:49.840 --> 14:56.040
and then later United States Steel announced price increases, averaging $4.50 a ton of steel.

14:56.040 --> 15:00.640
I am very disappointed that this action has taken place.

15:00.640 --> 15:04.480
In justification for their action, the steel companies take the position that a price

15:04.480 --> 15:11.000
increases needed in order to offset the increase in cost rising from wage increases granted

15:11.000 --> 15:17.880
under the third year of the steel companies contract with the United Steel Workers of America.

15:17.880 --> 15:23.280
Whether there is such a need is highly questionable to me, based on our experiences in the Anime

15:23.280 --> 15:28.440
Monopoly Committee of which I am chairman, which had a painstaking and thorough investigation

15:28.440 --> 15:30.320
of steel.

15:30.320 --> 15:35.920
Over the long run, most of the wage increases are offset by the increase in productivity,

15:35.920 --> 15:41.080
but the best evidence of the need or lack of need of the steel companies for a price increase

15:41.080 --> 15:44.400
can be gained by examining their profit figures.

15:44.400 --> 15:50.360
Of course, if this increases sustain as it may very well be, it means that the price of

15:50.360 --> 15:56.760
automobile, tractors, hand goods, everything that has steel in it even hairpins that women

15:56.760 --> 16:02.240
use will go up and the cost of living index also will go up.

16:02.400 --> 16:07.680
But let's talk about the profits and whether the steel price increase was justified.

16:07.680 --> 16:12.880
For the first half of this year, the United States Steel Company's profits after taxes

16:12.880 --> 16:17.360
on stockholders' investment was 9% on an annual basis.

16:17.360 --> 16:24.160
This is about the same level as it enjoyed in such so-called good years as 1924, 25, 28,

16:24.160 --> 16:26.480
49, and 54.

16:26.480 --> 16:31.920
And it has managed to do this while operating at only a little more than half capacity.

16:31.920 --> 16:37.640
Other of these figures indicate a need for a price increase is highly dubious to me.

16:37.640 --> 16:43.800
Above and beyond the effect of this increase on steel and direct steel bars, however,

16:43.800 --> 16:47.040
will be as effect upon the economy as a whole.

16:47.040 --> 16:51.040
For an earlier year, the nation has been experiencing a recession.

16:51.040 --> 16:55.720
In recent weeks, there have been some indications that we're pulling out of it, but it, but

16:55.720 --> 16:56.720
take it from me.

16:56.720 --> 17:02.120
If there's another wave of inflation, the bars will let their purse strings again, and

17:02.120 --> 17:05.640
the nation will plunge back into a worse recession.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.360
For weeks, I've been urging the President to bring the leaders of the steel industry

17:09.360 --> 17:14.840
and of the steel union together to work out some price wage formula that would prevent

17:14.840 --> 17:20.320
this increase, have each one of them grant some concessions, if necessary.

17:20.320 --> 17:25.200
I personally wide-rod your blower the head of the U.S. steel, and Dave McDonald, the head

17:25.200 --> 17:28.960
of the union, asking if they would attend such a meeting.

17:28.960 --> 17:33.760
Mr. McDonald said that he would, and Mr. Blower didn't say that he wouldn't.

17:33.760 --> 17:39.200
This, it seems to me, is a time for real statesmanship on the part of both labor and industry.

17:39.200 --> 17:43.760
I think that labor in the general good ought to be able to defer some concessions in order

17:43.760 --> 17:49.960
to have a whole-the-line, whole-the-priced-line formula, and to continue our recovery and to

17:49.960 --> 17:52.960
increase the employment of people.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.960
And you never know whether they would be willing to do until you get into a meeting, which

17:57.960 --> 18:00.480
I asked the President to call.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.720
And I think it's also a time for statesmanship on the part of the President.

18:04.720 --> 18:09.480
He can, and he should exert the leadership which is office demands when the good of the

18:09.480 --> 18:11.400
nation is involved.

18:11.400 --> 18:16.200
And I hope that even now, even though several companies have announced the price increase

18:16.200 --> 18:21.920
that he may call on them, and on the head of the union to work out some formula to call

18:21.920 --> 18:28.320
off this price increase so that we will not be subjected to another runnest round of

18:28.320 --> 18:29.320
inflation.

18:29.320 --> 18:34.400
And now, friends, let's turn to other subjects, which are great interests.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.160
Congress is rushing toward adjournment.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.160
Committees have been working early and late.

18:38.160 --> 18:44.000
There have been long and arduous floor sessions, but results are being achieved.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.240
I'm happy that the appropriation bill containing the planning and site money for the new federal

18:49.240 --> 18:54.680
building at Memphis was agreed to after a conference between the House and the Senate.

18:54.680 --> 18:58.400
The city will be able to go ahead with its plans for this new building and the new civic

18:58.400 --> 18:59.400
center now.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.960
The House this week reported out the TVA self-financing bill in the same manner that

19:03.960 --> 19:06.280
the Senate passed its last year.

19:06.280 --> 19:10.200
A spirited forefight is anticipated when this bill gets to the House.

19:10.200 --> 19:15.040
Nevertheless, we simply must have legislation for the TVA this year.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.640
Both the Senate and the House Judiciary Committees are again working on the omnibus

19:18.640 --> 19:23.720
Judship bill, which authorizes three new judges for Tennessee.

19:23.720 --> 19:34.560
This bill also is vitally important, and I'm doing all I can to help it alone.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.520
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, where we certainly have had our ups and downs

19:38.520 --> 19:43.960
in support of Tennessee Valley Authority as concern here in Congress this week.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.860
This year, as you will remember, the Senate passed a good and workable self-financing

19:47.860 --> 19:50.160
bill for the TVA.

19:50.160 --> 19:55.120
We haven't had any appropriations for new major projects and new starts in the TVA since

19:55.120 --> 20:00.200
the Eisenhower administration came to office in 1953.

20:00.200 --> 20:05.400
The president himself, as a matter of fact, recommended that in lieu of appropriations,

20:05.400 --> 20:11.360
the TVA be given the right to finance itself and so far as power operations are concerned.

20:11.360 --> 20:16.320
The House began renewed consideration of the bill a week before last.

20:16.320 --> 20:21.360
Private Parallel was out in force and conducted a vigorous campaign against it.

20:21.360 --> 20:27.200
Then this week, the House Rules Committee met and voted to deny the TVA rule for consideration

20:27.200 --> 20:28.520
of the bill.

20:28.520 --> 20:35.320
That meant that unless the Rules Committee reconsidered and I'm very happy to say they did reconsider,

20:35.320 --> 20:40.040
it would take a two-thirds vote to even bring the bill up for debate.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.800
I was heart sick over what took place, but I was glad that the Speaker of the House,

20:43.800 --> 20:47.840
Mr. Rayburn, went before the Rules Committee and helped the TVA.

20:47.840 --> 20:52.400
This doesn't mean that the bill is by the House yet, but we're not going to give up the

20:52.400 --> 20:55.840
fight until the last whistle is blown on this conference.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.840
I certainly hope that the bill is passed.

20:58.840 --> 21:04.120
We don't have a two-thirds vote in the House, but I do hope that we have majority.

21:04.120 --> 21:09.080
We only had two votes to start with in the Rules Committee, but I'm glad to say that

21:09.080 --> 21:11.520
many of our friends reconsidered.

21:11.520 --> 21:16.080
The tactics of the private Parallel lobby should be clear for all to see and let's take

21:16.080 --> 21:19.560
in place in connection with the TVA this week.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.640
For years, they complained about the TVA getting appropriations from Congress.

21:23.640 --> 21:28.880
And now it's clear that they really weren't worried about those appropriations at all,

21:28.880 --> 21:32.560
which the TVA has repaid on schedule with a handsome return.

21:32.560 --> 21:37.040
For now, they are clearly on the record as wanting to denounce even the right to finance

21:37.040 --> 21:38.040
ourselves.

21:38.040 --> 21:42.920
They are willing to jeopardize the investment that the government already has in the TVA

21:42.920 --> 21:48.000
in the future of an entire region just to get their own selfish way.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.280
What they want to do is simply to kill the TVA.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.360
It's as simple as that.

21:52.360 --> 21:58.240
And then with the example of TVA gone, they want to run away with their own prices.

21:58.240 --> 22:02.360
They want again, they unfettered right to gouge the consumer.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.520
The greed of the private Parallel lobby has brought it to grief before.

22:05.920 --> 22:11.680
And I predict that with this example, reminiscing as it is of the old ensue days, the private

22:11.680 --> 22:14.400
Parallel lobby is headed for grief again.

22:14.400 --> 22:19.160
It just doesn't know the meaning of the philosophy of live and let live.

22:19.160 --> 22:26.360
The House Committee dealt a serious and perhaps mortal blow to two other good and worthwhile

22:26.360 --> 22:28.920
pieces of legislation this week.

22:28.920 --> 22:33.760
One of these was the foreign bill, and I hope that they will reconsider that also.

22:33.760 --> 22:38.240
The House tried desperately to overrule its rules committee on this very necessary foreign

22:38.240 --> 22:39.240
bill.

22:39.240 --> 22:44.040
And while there was a clear majority vote in favor of such action, the bill failed to get

22:44.040 --> 22:46.480
the necessary two-thirds vote.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.840
As you know, I supported and worked for this bill in the Senate, and it was passed in the

22:50.840 --> 22:51.840
Senate.

22:51.840 --> 22:56.840
The House Agricultural Committee reported it out in substantially the same form by unanimous

22:56.840 --> 22:57.840
vote.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.760
The rules committee decided to use its veto.

23:00.760 --> 23:06.120
This is very, very serious in that it means that unless the bill is proud out of the House,

23:06.120 --> 23:09.040
there will be a large cut in cotton acreage.

23:09.040 --> 23:13.720
It also means that the small farmer will get a further cut, and some of them can hardly

23:13.720 --> 23:15.680
survive as it is.

23:15.680 --> 23:20.320
And it delays the day when cotton will become competitive on the world market.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.080
Finally, there's the community facilities bill.

23:23.080 --> 23:26.400
I sponsored this along with Senator Fulbright in the Senate.

23:26.400 --> 23:32.400
This bill would have made it possible for communities, cities and counties and school districts

23:32.400 --> 23:37.440
to finance local public works programs at low interest rates and over a long period of

23:37.440 --> 23:38.440
years.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.160
It would have been a great help to our economy.

23:41.160 --> 23:45.920
I can't remember anything which has so interested the local officials of Tennessee.

23:45.920 --> 23:51.160
I have many, many letters from mayors, county judges, and others outlining much-needed work

23:51.160 --> 23:53.320
that they would do under this program.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.040
But again, the rules committee denied it a rule.

23:56.040 --> 24:01.240
All I can say is that we will try again next year, and I hope we will be successful.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.880
There are often disappointments in this legislative business.

24:03.880 --> 24:07.080
You work awfully hard for something, and then you see it lost.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.680
But the only thing to do is to keep on trying.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.880
I often think of the late Senator George Norris.

24:11.880 --> 24:16.880
He tried for years to establish the TBA only to fail repeatedly, and then he finally got

24:16.880 --> 24:17.880
it passed.

24:17.880 --> 24:21.480
And we'll stay with this, do the same thing this time.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.480
That's all for now.

24:22.480 --> 24:30.480
Thank you very much.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.560
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, well we have a lot of things to talk about

24:34.560 --> 24:35.560
this week.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.320
First, I'm glad that it compromised.

24:37.320 --> 24:41.360
It apparently has been reached in the house, which will make it possible for a farm bill

24:41.360 --> 24:43.360
to pass this year.

24:43.360 --> 24:49.080
The compromise will grant larger acreages for corn, cotton, and extend the wool act.

24:49.080 --> 24:53.640
There won't really be a satisfactory program, compromises seldom are.

24:53.640 --> 24:57.340
Nevertheless it will make it possible for the cotton farmers and particular the small

24:57.340 --> 25:03.400
ones to survive, which would not be true as far as many small cotton farmers are concerned

25:03.400 --> 25:06.960
in the absence of any legislation at all.

25:06.960 --> 25:12.040
Next the very important National Defense Education Bill, which had already passed the House

25:12.040 --> 25:17.080
of Representatives was passed by the Senate in a meeting this week which ran on until after

25:17.080 --> 25:18.400
midnight.

25:18.400 --> 25:23.460
The program was proposed after the nation was shot last fall when it suddenly came to

25:23.460 --> 25:28.780
foot to the full realization that the Soviet Union is outstripping the United States and

25:28.780 --> 25:31.340
many fields of education.

25:31.340 --> 25:36.520
The bill would set up a four year program of federal scholarships, scholarships, and student

25:36.520 --> 25:43.120
loans, but preference given to students of science, mathematics, and foreign languages.

25:43.120 --> 25:48.420
These would be provided to state education agencies for improvements of science facilities

25:48.420 --> 25:54.680
in elementary and secondary schools and for a guidance in counseling program.

25:54.680 --> 25:59.400
Under the bill, institutes would be established to train teachers in subjects deemed necessary

25:59.400 --> 26:01.600
for the National Defense.

26:01.600 --> 26:07.200
There would be support for vocational training and financial help for research and new educational

26:07.200 --> 26:08.200
techniques.

26:08.760 --> 26:14.160
Finally the bill sets up a National Advisory Council on Science and Education.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.440
I supported the bill strongly.

26:16.440 --> 26:21.080
I was one of its co-sponsors and I posed the amendment which cut the scholarship grants

26:21.080 --> 26:25.480
from $1,000 a year to $250 a year.

26:25.480 --> 26:29.960
President Eisenhower incidentally had supported the $1,000 figure.

26:29.960 --> 26:33.840
I think it was very short-sighted for the Senate to make this reduction.

26:33.840 --> 26:38.640
I hope that it will not result in too many talented and deserving young people who could

26:38.640 --> 26:44.540
make a real contribution to this country, being denied an adequate education and they feel

26:44.540 --> 26:49.480
so vital to our national defense that I'm afraid it might.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.640
Education doesn't come at bargain basement rates.

26:52.640 --> 26:57.120
I didn't want to mention something which did not occur on the floors of Congress, but which

26:57.120 --> 27:00.280
is of overriding importance to all of us.

27:00.280 --> 27:05.040
That is the action which began this week and the United Nations General Assembly which

27:05.040 --> 27:10.800
President Eisenhower personally addressed and I'm proud of the address that he made.

27:10.800 --> 27:16.000
In his address the President outlined a program which the United States was willing to back

27:16.000 --> 27:19.160
in an effort to restore peace to the Middle East.

27:19.160 --> 27:24.880
The President proposed a United Nations peace force that could move swiftly to save Middle

27:24.880 --> 27:31.000
East governments threatened by armed pressure and infiltration coming across the borders.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.640
This is far superior to the practice of sending United States Marines.

27:35.640 --> 27:40.280
It is consistent with an action which I supported here in the Senate and which I talked about

27:40.280 --> 27:46.800
on this program last week, namely the setting up of a permanent UN Security Force.

27:46.800 --> 27:53.560
The President proposed also a regional development institution which could get outside help,

27:53.560 --> 27:58.200
which would be governed by the Arab states themselves and whose aim would be to raise

27:58.200 --> 28:00.880
the standard of living in the Middle East.

28:00.880 --> 28:05.880
The institution would try to develop water resources to make the desert bloom, help the

28:05.880 --> 28:10.160
countries to fight disease and otherwise promote progress.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.160
Balees ideas aren't new.

28:12.160 --> 28:16.640
Many have urged them for years including a team from the Tennessee Valley Authority which

28:16.640 --> 28:20.240
studied the Jordan River almost a decade ago.

28:20.240 --> 28:24.520
It is most encouraging to have the President present to them, present them to the United

28:24.520 --> 28:29.720
Nations and seek to lift the minds of the nations from their petty quarrels to the great

28:29.720 --> 28:33.440
possibilities cooperation would bring.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.840
If the President will only follow through and I certainly hope that he will and seek to

28:37.840 --> 28:43.880
implement these ideas, then we could someday see a stable and prosperous Middle East which

28:43.880 --> 28:47.480
is not a constant threat to world peace.

28:47.480 --> 28:51.160
Well the Congress this week is nearing adjournment.

28:51.160 --> 28:57.360
I think that by the end of next Saturday we may be through but it is anybody's guess.

28:57.360 --> 29:02.480
We have a great minute pieces of legislation and we have all been very busy trying to

29:02.480 --> 29:06.280
go a lot of bills and things through the Congress during these dying days.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.320
Thank you and that's all until next week.

29:17.880 --> 29:22.480
Ladies and gentlemen I distinguish in a very fine gentleman who is very much in the news

29:22.480 --> 29:28.840
these days is Admiral Rickover and I know that all of you are very happy to see Admiral Rick

29:28.840 --> 29:29.840
over again.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.840
Thank you.

29:30.840 --> 29:38.000
Admiral Rickover as all of you know was the head of the team and the man who sparked the

29:38.000 --> 29:46.000
effort and who is responsible for the development of the submarine notalus in which a Tennessee

29:46.000 --> 29:53.500
boy Commander Anderson from Waverley Tennessee took this notalus of which this is a model

29:53.500 --> 29:59.720
under the ice cap under the North Pole in a most remarkable journey historic journey

29:59.720 --> 30:02.320
10 days ago.

30:02.320 --> 30:08.120
Admiral Rickover I believe that you trained Commander Anderson didn't you?

30:08.120 --> 30:13.720
Yes sir Commander Anderson worked in my office for about a year preparatory to going

30:13.720 --> 30:15.920
on the models.

30:15.920 --> 30:22.480
Well how did this submarine get under the ice cap of the North Pole?

30:22.480 --> 30:24.320
Did you think it ever wouldn't make it?

30:24.320 --> 30:32.020
Yes sir we had planned for this trip Commander Anderson and I for quite some time and he

30:32.020 --> 30:38.480
actually steamed about 1900 miles under the ice cap on an unstop trip.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.480
1900 miles.

30:40.480 --> 30:48.560
Well Admiral Rickover we might have proud of Commander Anderson down in Tennessee and

30:48.560 --> 30:50.480
I know that you are proud of him.

30:50.480 --> 30:55.400
We are all proud of him everyone in the Navy is proud and we are also proud of what the

30:55.400 --> 30:59.000
event signifies for the future defense of our country.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.960
Well what do you feel about that aspect of the matter?

31:02.960 --> 31:08.400
It means that now the whole polar regions are open to us as an area of warfare.

31:08.400 --> 31:13.480
It means that we can have missile carrying submarines hiding out under the ice and if

31:13.480 --> 31:19.600
anyone dares to attack us even if they destroy the United States they inevitably will be

31:19.600 --> 31:21.200
destroyed themselves.

31:21.200 --> 31:25.440
Well thank you very much Admiral Rickover and you are proud of Commander Anderson we are

31:25.440 --> 31:27.280
and we are mighty mighty proud of you.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.280
Very much thank you very much.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.280
Thank you very much.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.280
I hope you've always given our programs.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.280
Thank you Admiral Rickover.

31:38.520 --> 31:47.600
Ladies and gentlemen friends of Tennessee as this telecast is being prepared the second

31:47.600 --> 31:51.720
session of the 85th Congress is in its last moments.

31:51.720 --> 31:55.440
This has been an interesting session of Congress in many many ways.

31:55.440 --> 32:00.520
Perhaps looking back which from the vantage point of time we may sometime call it a historic

32:00.520 --> 32:01.760
one.

32:01.760 --> 32:06.560
This Congress was the first to be faced with the challenges of the space age heralded by

32:06.560 --> 32:09.320
the satellites now circling the earth.

32:09.320 --> 32:14.440
The session began with a searching for the significance of this venture into space and

32:14.440 --> 32:19.240
with a realization that what had been regarded as adequate here to for could no longer be

32:19.240 --> 32:20.960
so regarded.

32:20.960 --> 32:26.280
We have passed considerable major legislation which I feel was vitally necessary to guarantee

32:26.280 --> 32:32.640
our security and to enable us to prepare adequately for our ever increasing responsibilities

32:32.640 --> 32:34.480
in this new age.

32:34.480 --> 32:38.920
For example I strongly supported the Defense reorganization plan.

32:38.920 --> 32:44.320
I also strongly supported the establishment of a new agency designed to deal specifically

32:44.320 --> 32:49.760
with the development of a comprehensive program of research and operations and aeronautical

32:49.760 --> 32:52.080
and space sciences.

32:52.080 --> 32:58.160
This newly created agency is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to be civilian

32:58.160 --> 33:03.480
controlled and to deal with the problems of space flight and the development of aircraft,

33:03.480 --> 33:06.320
missiles and other space vehicles.

33:06.320 --> 33:10.080
It is indeed a dramatic and interesting step into the future.

33:10.080 --> 33:16.000
I also supported the National Defense Education Bill providing for federal scholarships to aid

33:16.000 --> 33:21.320
talented students and assisting the states to improve science, mathematics and language

33:21.320 --> 33:22.920
teaching.

33:22.920 --> 33:27.840
Congress further responded to the critical military problems by appropriating a record

33:27.840 --> 33:31.720
amount during peacetime for the defense of our nation.

33:31.720 --> 33:36.360
In the field of foreign affairs we passed two extremely important builds to which I gave

33:36.360 --> 33:37.840
my support.

33:37.840 --> 33:43.400
The troubles in Latin America and the crises in the Middle East underlang the vital need

33:43.400 --> 33:47.800
for full authorization of the mutual security problem.

33:47.800 --> 33:52.880
The military and economic support provided under this act is that one part of our attempt

33:52.880 --> 33:58.800
to meet the challenge of Russia's determination to wage wars of economic aggression combined

33:58.800 --> 34:01.120
with political subversion.

34:01.120 --> 34:06.200
This challenge also pointed out the need for an extension of the reciprocal trade program

34:06.200 --> 34:08.880
originated by Cordell Ho.

34:08.880 --> 34:13.800
This program has been extended for a period of four years which will give the nation's

34:13.800 --> 34:20.000
traders an opportunity to negotiate long, long-arranged contracts in the head before.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.400
This will give free enterprise a free-or-hand in meeting the challenge of Russia's controlled

34:24.400 --> 34:27.640
economy in the world's markets.

34:27.640 --> 34:33.080
Under domestic side I supported several measures designed to stimulate business, restore consumer

34:33.080 --> 34:35.920
confidence and stimulate the economy.

34:35.920 --> 34:39.960
I regret that the Community Facilities Act which would have made it possible for local

34:39.960 --> 34:45.760
communities to undertake long deferred and greatly needed public improvements failed to pass

34:45.760 --> 34:46.760
in the house.

34:46.760 --> 34:52.400
However, other proposals met with more success, including a major housing bill to put new

34:52.400 --> 34:55.640
life into the construction industry.

34:55.640 --> 35:00.360
During the session I spent much time as you know as chairman of the Antimanopoli Committee

35:00.360 --> 35:03.760
trying to beat the inflation which is threatening us.

35:03.760 --> 35:08.640
Also we pass legislation requiring managers of employee welfare funds to register those

35:08.640 --> 35:13.880
funds with a Department of Labor and thereby make their activities public.

35:13.880 --> 35:19.080
Unfortunately, the more comprehensive labor bill failed to pass in the house.

35:19.080 --> 35:23.320
There were many activities in this Congress of particular interest at Tennessee.

35:23.320 --> 35:26.920
The new water pollution control compact was passed.

35:26.920 --> 35:32.000
We secured appropriations for new flood control and harbor works, including the long delayed

35:32.000 --> 35:34.080
work on the West Tennessee tributaries.

35:34.080 --> 35:40.200
A bill in which we were all greatly interested, the TBA self-financing bill, which passed

35:40.200 --> 35:43.280
the Senate last year failed to come to a vote in the house.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.600
Here's a measure which we should start on very early in the next year and see that it

35:47.600 --> 35:48.920
is passed.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.880
This has been a very sketchy summary and many things of important of not importance have

35:52.880 --> 35:54.520
not been mentioned.

35:54.520 --> 35:58.920
But before closing I wanted to take this opportunity to thank this station for carrying

35:58.920 --> 36:02.880
my reports during this year as a public service.

36:02.880 --> 36:06.760
And I wanted to thank you for the interest that you have taken, for the letters and suggestions

36:06.760 --> 36:08.800
that I have received.

36:08.800 --> 36:15.080
And so now until the next session of Congress, goodbye.

36:15.080 --> 36:28.720
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this will be my last broadcast of the first

36:28.720 --> 36:31.200
session of the 85th Congress.

36:31.200 --> 36:36.080
I want to say that I have enjoyed very much having these weekly business with you.

36:36.080 --> 36:41.600
And I want to express my very deep appreciation for the cooperation of this station and making

36:41.600 --> 36:42.600
them possible.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.800
As soon as Congress adjourns, I am scheduled to leave for Europe, where I am looking forward

36:47.800 --> 36:51.040
eagerly to rejoining Nancy and the children.

36:51.040 --> 36:55.200
They have been vacationing at Nancy's former home in Scotland.

36:55.200 --> 36:59.760
It will be a brief vacation for the Senate has named me as a delegate to the Interparlimentary

36:59.760 --> 37:05.080
Union meeting, scheduled to convene in London September 12.

37:05.080 --> 37:09.680
There I will have the opportunity of meeting with members of Parliament and Congresses

37:09.680 --> 37:11.480
of other countries.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.760
And we will discuss some of the common problems that our nation's face.

37:15.760 --> 37:21.520
And following that on September 23 and 24, I will attend the Western World Conference

37:21.520 --> 37:23.240
in Paris.

37:23.240 --> 37:27.800
This conference will be composed of representatives of the NATO countries.

37:27.800 --> 37:31.880
They will not all be government officials, but will include journalists and other leading

37:31.880 --> 37:32.880
citizens.

37:32.880 --> 37:39.040
To discuss some of the ways many of the problems that the set the free world can be settled

37:39.040 --> 37:41.880
on a citizen to citizen basis.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.920
I consider such meetings as these of very great importance.

37:45.920 --> 37:51.440
I believe that it is in the face to face exchanges of opinions and views that we secure

37:51.440 --> 37:58.440
the kind of knowledge and understanding that others must follow in order to get, and we

37:58.440 --> 38:03.680
all must follow in order to knock off the rough edges of international relations.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.920
We, Tennessee, have known that for a long time.

38:06.920 --> 38:11.680
It is one of the doctrines that Cardell Ho always preached and followed.

38:11.680 --> 38:15.980
And after these meetings, I will return to Washington for a resumption of the steel here

38:15.980 --> 38:16.980
in.

38:16.980 --> 38:21.800
Our anti-monopoly subcommittee had to interrupt these hearings due to the rest of the final

38:21.800 --> 38:24.560
days before the adjournment of the country.

38:24.560 --> 38:29.760
We have finished with the United States steel company, the price leader in their steel, who

38:29.760 --> 38:32.680
raised their prices six dollars a ton.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.280
We will resume with Bethlehem steel.

38:35.280 --> 38:40.320
Among other things we want to know about practically all the other companies, felt they should

38:40.320 --> 38:44.400
raise their prices exactly six dollars a ton.

38:44.400 --> 38:48.500
During recesses and interruptions of these hearings, I hope to get in a lot of visits to

38:48.500 --> 38:50.000
Tennessee.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.640
In other words, I hope to be seeing you in person.

38:53.640 --> 38:58.600
Well the adjournment of the session of Congress is always a time for looking over the record

38:58.600 --> 39:03.240
of what has been done and what has been left undone.

39:03.240 --> 39:06.160
Congress will be doing that for many weeks to come.

39:06.160 --> 39:10.360
Personally, I dislike the numbers method of assessing the Congress.

39:10.360 --> 39:16.000
This Congress passed so many laws and this one passed so many more and therefore the one

39:16.000 --> 39:18.880
that passed the most must have been the best.

39:18.880 --> 39:23.320
I have been a member of Congress and the House and the Senate for more than 19 years now.

39:23.320 --> 39:29.560
And I have been a member of those that passed many laws and those that passed not so many.

39:29.880 --> 39:34.920
And I can tell you that sometimes the Congress rises to its greatest heights when it doesn't

39:34.920 --> 39:35.920
pass the law.

39:35.920 --> 39:41.840
There are many proposals, fiercely lobbied for by special interest groups, which should

39:41.840 --> 39:47.480
not become law and Congress should be congratulated for standing up against them.

39:47.480 --> 39:53.120
Some such examples in this session were the proposal to return the alien property, a pure

39:53.120 --> 39:58.320
special interest piece of legislation, a brick or amendment which seems to be constantly

39:58.320 --> 40:03.280
recurring in a new form but still with a purpose of stripping the President of his right

40:03.280 --> 40:05.960
to act and foreign affairs.

40:05.960 --> 40:11.000
The natural gas bill, the pre-matchel gas from regulation and incidentally to raise the

40:11.000 --> 40:14.200
price of gas and many many others.

40:14.200 --> 40:19.200
On the other hand, some very good far reaching legislation did pass this conference, such as

40:19.200 --> 40:25.880
the Niagara River Power Project, the Adams for Peace Program, the TVA Self-Financing Program

40:25.880 --> 40:30.200
which passed the Senate, but still has to go through the House of Representatives.

40:30.200 --> 40:35.840
The flood control bill, under which we will able to include the Memphis Farber and many

40:35.840 --> 40:39.760
projects on the Cumberland River and other places in Tennessee.

40:39.760 --> 40:44.800
I think it is well that some settlement of the civil rights issue seems to have been achieved.

40:44.800 --> 40:47.680
Of course, I'm not satisfied by any means.

40:47.680 --> 40:52.880
If I could have had my brothers, as the little boy says, I'd like to include a stool building

40:52.880 --> 40:57.080
aid program, more housing assistance and many many other things.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.560
But neither am I wholly disappointed.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.080
And now goodbye from this program until next year.

41:02.080 --> 41:06.600
I want to thank you for your interest in this program for your letters and once again

41:06.600 --> 41:19.800
to this station for carrying this program as public service.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.560
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

41:22.560 --> 41:27.600
This week the Senate lost upon what may prove to be an historic debate and the traditional

41:27.600 --> 41:30.160
and classic sense of that word.

41:30.160 --> 41:35.240
The debate revolved around the so-called Eisenhower Civil Rights Bill.

41:35.240 --> 41:40.120
On Monday, Senator William Nolan of California, the minority leaders, moved that the Senate

41:40.120 --> 41:44.440
take up the bill which was then reposing on the calendar.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.800
His motion touched off to debate.

41:46.800 --> 41:52.160
Up to the moment of this filming of this broadcast, and I feel certain up to the moment of

41:52.160 --> 41:57.760
your viewing it, we still will be technically debating the motion to take up the bill.

41:57.760 --> 42:02.600
Theoretically, debate on the bill will follow after that time.

42:02.600 --> 42:08.080
The debate was launched on a high level by both sides, marked only by one off-key comment.

42:08.080 --> 42:14.120
There's an Eisenhower who bears responsible responsibility for the bill, because it was

42:14.120 --> 42:16.720
in his name that it must present it.

42:16.720 --> 42:20.880
Showed his disposition to sit down and reason when he admitted that he didn't understand

42:20.880 --> 42:24.880
it all and that there was some vague language that he wanted to consider.

42:24.880 --> 42:30.520
While he met with Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, the bill's leading critic, Senator

42:30.520 --> 42:36.120
Russell for his part showed a similar disposition to reason when he declined to force the vote

42:36.120 --> 42:38.800
on his point of order against the bill.

42:38.800 --> 42:43.680
Namely, that technical corrections and the printing rendered it a bill so erroneous that

42:43.680 --> 42:47.240
consideration would have to start all over a new.

42:47.240 --> 42:50.120
They weren't off-key comment to which I referred.

42:50.120 --> 42:53.800
They won an only comment of the week which showed a lack of understanding.

42:53.800 --> 42:59.560
A patent political attitude for this historic debate was uttered by the vice president of

42:59.560 --> 43:02.400
the United States, Richard Nixon.

43:02.400 --> 43:07.400
He chose this moment to save flatly and unequivocally, that the bill would be passed with no

43:07.400 --> 43:08.400
amendments whatsoever.

43:08.400 --> 43:14.840
In his utterance, there was no room for compromise, for correction, for improvement.

43:14.840 --> 43:19.480
For my own part, I entered into this debate and the spirit typified by the words of Senator

43:19.480 --> 43:23.720
Lyndon Johnson of Texas, the majority leader.

43:23.720 --> 43:29.600
Senator Johnson said, the immediate objective is to ensure fairness and thoroughness.

43:29.600 --> 43:34.760
As long as we are fair and thorough, I believe that ultimately we shall arrive at constructive

43:34.760 --> 43:35.760
achievements.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.880
I too believe that.

43:37.880 --> 43:42.800
I think that the stated purpose of this bill, a guarantee of the right to vote is a good

43:42.800 --> 43:43.800
one.

43:43.800 --> 43:48.560
All citizens of the United States, every one of them, no matter what his color, what his

43:48.560 --> 43:56.120
religion, what his origin, if he meets the requirements as to age, education and residence,

43:56.120 --> 43:58.360
should be guaranteed that right.

43:58.360 --> 44:03.240
In seeking the guarantee one right, we should not sacrifice another.

44:03.240 --> 44:07.840
And therefore our favor and will support an amendment, the guarantee that a jury's tile

44:07.840 --> 44:13.040
will be a court of those who may be cited for contempt, on charges of violating the right

44:13.040 --> 44:17.640
to resist bill, of course, namely the right to vote.

44:17.640 --> 44:23.240
My time is almost up, but imposing, let me say that although some may not agree with

44:23.240 --> 44:29.560
the purposes of this bill, let us not forget that we are living in an age of vast and great

44:29.560 --> 44:30.560
change.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.640
The course of history cannot be saved.

44:33.640 --> 44:38.680
The world in this age of mobility and justice has struck engraved.

44:38.680 --> 44:43.360
Our neighbors in the world look to us, the practice to democracy that we preach.

44:43.360 --> 44:47.000
And that democracy revolves around the ballot, the right to vote.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.840
If the bill is simply a guarantee of the right to vote and it is brought down to that

44:51.840 --> 44:57.360
basis, then I think that the vast majority of Americans, both North and South and East

44:57.360 --> 44:59.920
and West, will be far and will support it.

44:59.920 --> 45:05.400
To debate our field, if it continues on this tile level, will be both enlightening and

45:05.400 --> 45:09.760
helpful and educational to the people of the United States.

45:09.760 --> 45:15.200
I will continue to report to you on the progress of this debate from time to time because I

45:15.200 --> 45:18.360
think it's going to be going on for a long time.

45:18.360 --> 45:24.360
Let me say that it was when the extreme regrets that we were, I felt that we were unable to

45:24.360 --> 45:30.040
get up to the TBA self-financing bill before this debate started.

45:30.040 --> 45:34.520
I hope that this bill, which has now been reported out of the public works committee, which

45:34.520 --> 45:41.440
will enable the TBA to issue bonds to continue to build steam plants to serve our people.

45:41.440 --> 45:46.280
This bill may be brought up sometime this session after this debate is over.

45:46.280 --> 45:53.480
And the same is true of the bill, which is now in the Jewish air committee, which many

45:53.480 --> 45:57.680
people can see came up to testify about this week.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.680
That's all for now.

45:58.680 --> 45:59.680
Thank you.

45:59.680 --> 46:00.680
I'll see you guys next week.
