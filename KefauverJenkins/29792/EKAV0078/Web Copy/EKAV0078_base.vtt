00:00.000 --> 00:16.820
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Estes Kefauver, candidate for re-election to the United States

00:16.820 --> 00:19.420
Senate for a second term.

00:19.420 --> 00:23.300
On this occasion I want to talk with you for a little while about the work of our Senate

00:23.300 --> 00:26.220
Crime Investigating Committee.

00:26.220 --> 00:32.020
We will all recall that back in 1950 and before that time it was generally reported and

00:32.020 --> 00:38.600
acknowledged that there were syndicated interstate criminal operations operating all across

00:38.600 --> 00:40.820
this country on an organized basis.

00:40.820 --> 00:46.360
They had become so powerful that many local communities were unable to cope with them.

00:46.360 --> 00:50.820
They were on the upgrade all through the nation.

00:50.820 --> 00:53.420
Well something had to be done about it.

00:53.420 --> 00:58.680
I filed a resolution for the establishment of a Senate committee to investigate this

00:58.680 --> 00:59.680
situation.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.260
I fought for this resolution through the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate

01:04.260 --> 01:06.660
over substantial opposition.

01:06.660 --> 01:11.820
Then after the committee was created the committee of five went from one part of this nation to

01:11.820 --> 01:17.380
the other holding hundreds of hearings in the large cities, the nerve centers of organized

01:17.380 --> 01:23.940
crime, bringing before us the leading record peers and gangsters and criminals of this nation.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.860
We exposed them for what they were.

01:26.860 --> 01:30.660
We turned the spotlight of public opinion upon them.

01:30.660 --> 01:36.820
What we found was that they were taking billions and billions of dollars away from the American

01:36.820 --> 01:39.860
people in gambling and in all other kinds of crime.

01:39.860 --> 01:44.700
But with this tremendous amount of money they were getting into all kinds of legitimate

01:44.700 --> 01:49.820
businesses where they used the same unfair business methods that they did in their gang

01:49.820 --> 01:50.980
life.

01:50.980 --> 01:54.940
But to even worse than this they were warming their way into politics and the government

01:54.940 --> 01:59.380
at all levels, local state and even the federal.

01:59.380 --> 02:03.740
And in this government, in this effort they were taking over the law enforcement agencies

02:03.740 --> 02:06.380
of some of our towns and counties.

02:06.380 --> 02:09.660
Well this is eating at the very heart of our democracy.

02:09.660 --> 02:15.220
We know that nations that were as great in their time as we are in our time have passed

02:15.220 --> 02:20.660
away and become third-rate nations, not because of invasion from without, but because of

02:20.660 --> 02:22.860
crime and corruption within.

02:22.860 --> 02:26.420
And we don't want that to happen to the United States.

02:26.420 --> 02:31.500
Well as a result of our crime investigating committee and Mr. J. Edgar Hoover has lauded

02:31.500 --> 02:36.660
the work of our committee and said this is true, the gangs have been broken up.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.700
America is a cleaner nation.

02:38.700 --> 02:43.660
The Great Nationwide Wire Service which furnished gambling information to bookmakers and gambling

02:43.660 --> 02:51.100
places all over the United States, which was operated by Mickey McBride out of Chicago,

02:51.100 --> 02:53.620
had to go out of business because we exposed it.

02:53.620 --> 02:57.540
We showed where the connections were and who was operating them.

02:57.540 --> 03:03.260
It was this Great Nationwide Wire Service that held together the gangsters into an organized

03:03.260 --> 03:06.740
society which was such a great menace to our nation.

03:06.740 --> 03:13.180
It's interesting to note in passing that an associate of Mr. McBride, the general manager

03:13.180 --> 03:19.740
of the radio station which he and his son, Owen Mostard, WMEI down at Miami, has been

03:19.740 --> 03:24.340
in Tennessee as a political consultant of one of my opponents and has been putting on

03:24.340 --> 03:27.580
in many of the large cities what he's called a talkathon.

03:27.580 --> 03:31.020
Well I know that these people don't like me.

03:31.020 --> 03:32.980
I know that they want to get revenge.

03:32.980 --> 03:37.620
I know that they don't want me in the United States Senate but I'm glad to have them on

03:37.620 --> 03:39.260
the other side.

03:39.260 --> 03:45.180
As a result of our crime investigating committee many of the top criminals have been put

03:45.180 --> 03:46.180
out of business.

03:46.180 --> 03:47.460
Many have been in jail.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.460
Many have been deported.

03:49.460 --> 03:54.580
But most important of all I think America is a much cleaner place with better people

03:54.580 --> 04:01.060
participating in politics and in government and insisting upon good law enforcement everywhere.

04:01.060 --> 04:25.340
I'm proud of the work that our Senate crime investigating committee did.

04:25.340 --> 04:30.500
Ladies and gentlemen this is Estus Keefer, candidate for re-election to the United States

04:30.500 --> 04:33.100
Senate for our second term.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.940
On this occasion I want to talk with you for a little while about the work of our Senate

04:36.940 --> 04:39.860

04:52.260 --> 04:54.660

04:54.660 --> 05:00.020

05:00.020 --> 05:04.500

05:04.500 --> 05:07.100

05:13.300 --> 05:17.940

We exposed them for what they were.

05:58.340 --> 06:03.420
businesses where they used the same unfair business methods that they did in their gang

life.

06:04.420 --> 06:08.620

06:57.300 --> 07:04.740
places all over the United States, which was operated by Mickey McBride out of Chicago,

07:04.740 --> 07:07.260
had to go out of business because we exposed it.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.180
We showed where the connections were and who was operating them.

07:11.180 --> 07:16.900
It was this Great Nationwide Wire Service that held together the gangsters into an organized

07:16.900 --> 07:20.380
society which was such a great menace to our nation.

07:20.380 --> 07:26.820
It's interesting to note in passing that an associate of Mr. McBride, the general manager

Well I know that these people don't like me.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.620
I know that they want to get revenge.

07:46.660 --> 07:51.260
I know that they don't want me in the United States Senate but I'm glad to have them on

07:51.260 --> 07:52.900
the other side.

07:52.900 --> 07:58.820
As a result of our crime investigating committee many of the top criminals have been put

07:58.820 --> 07:59.820
out of business.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.100
Many have been in jail.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.300
Many have been deported.

08:03.300 --> 08:08.220
But most important of all I think America is a much cleaner place with better people

08:08.220 --> 08:14.700
participating in politics and in government and insisting upon good law enforcement everywhere.

08:14.700 --> 08:18.380
I'm proud of the work that our Senate crime investigating committee did.

08:18.380 --> 08:40.740
Ladies and gentlemen this is Estes Keefolver speaking.

08:40.740 --> 08:45.460
I'm seeking re-election to a second term in the United States Senate.

08:45.460 --> 08:51.460
On this occasion I want to talk with you about the biggest issue before the American people

08:51.460 --> 08:54.940
and indeed the free people anywhere in the world.

08:54.940 --> 08:58.140
And that is the great issue of war or peace.

08:58.140 --> 09:03.980
Whether we're going to be able to have something better and fighting wars every 25 years.

09:03.980 --> 09:10.340
We know that civilization cannot exist if we're going to have continuing atomic and hydrogen

09:10.340 --> 09:12.340
bomb wars.

09:12.340 --> 09:16.420
We also know that if there is light in the world today it's going to be our nation that

09:16.420 --> 09:19.580
will have to finish the light and the leadership.

09:19.580 --> 09:24.860
But if we're going to have a chance of living in a peaceful world where wars will not be fought

09:24.860 --> 09:27.180
to the devastation of society.

09:27.180 --> 09:32.020
That it will largely be through the leadership of the United States of America.

09:32.020 --> 09:36.460
Therefore anything that we can do in order to bring about peace with honor we want to

09:36.460 --> 09:37.460
do.

09:37.460 --> 09:40.180
And I want any effort that I can make.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.780
And might contribute to this.

09:41.780 --> 09:45.900
I have always in the past made and I will make in the future.

09:45.900 --> 09:52.540
As a young man the idea of the League of Nations advanced by that great president Woodrow Wilson

09:52.540 --> 09:54.580
caught my imagination.

09:54.580 --> 09:59.500
I've always felt that if we had used the prestige and the spiritual strength and the economic

09:59.500 --> 10:05.580
stability of the United States in the League of Nations as was recommended by Woodrow Wilson

10:05.660 --> 10:08.780
at this second war might have been avoided.

10:08.780 --> 10:14.940
So that after we had fought to victory in World War II we had no alternative but to play

10:14.940 --> 10:18.580
our part for good among the nations of the world.

10:18.580 --> 10:23.900
I was proud of the fact that it was a great tenisee and who fathered the United Nations.

10:23.900 --> 10:28.660
I know the United Nations may not be popular in certain circles today.

10:28.660 --> 10:32.580
United Nations has not accomplished everything that we would like for it to.

10:32.580 --> 10:36.900
But after all ladies and gentlemen it is the only organization that we have in the world

10:36.900 --> 10:40.700
through which we have a chance of working for peace.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.500
And I think it deserves our support and backing.

10:43.500 --> 10:50.140
I'm not in favour of recognising or admitting the present communist government of China as

10:50.140 --> 10:55.420
a member of the United Nations and as long as we exercise the veto she cannot be a member

10:55.420 --> 10:58.420
of the Security Council of the United Nations.

10:58.420 --> 11:03.780
And I'm in favour of exercising that veto but I'm not in favour of destroying the United

11:03.780 --> 11:04.780
Nations.

11:04.780 --> 11:07.580
We must keep and we must build it up.

11:07.580 --> 11:11.980
And likewise I've always felt that if the free people of any nation could stand together

11:11.980 --> 11:17.500
with some kind of unity we could avoid wars because communist and totalitarians would know

11:17.500 --> 11:22.860
that they could not defeat the democratic people as long as they were unified.

11:22.860 --> 11:28.660
It was the hope of Kaiser Wilhelm and of the madmen Hitler and Mussolini that the democracies

11:28.660 --> 11:30.460
would be divided.

11:30.460 --> 11:35.580
NATO was an effort to bring together the military unity of these nations.

11:35.580 --> 11:40.020
But in order to have military unity you must also have some kind of political and economic

11:40.020 --> 11:41.620
understandings.

11:41.620 --> 11:46.260
So I was very proud of the fact that along with 27 other senators including many of our

11:46.260 --> 11:53.340
neighbors like Senator George of George and Fulbright at Warkensau, Maybank of South

11:53.340 --> 11:58.780
Carolina, I had the privilege of sponsoring the so-called Atlantic Union resolution to

11:58.780 --> 12:03.260
ask for a meeting to at least talk things over to see if we couldn't agree upon closer

12:03.260 --> 12:04.260
unity.

12:04.260 --> 12:07.740
If we had done that we might not be so far away today.

12:07.740 --> 12:12.540
I think the United States must stay militarily strong and I've always voted to keep the United

12:12.540 --> 12:16.860
States military might up so we could take care of ourselves.

12:16.860 --> 12:23.260
But in addition to military strength we must lead a spiritual and economic, a political

12:23.260 --> 12:28.940
and an educational campaign in the cause of peace in the world if we are going to be successful

12:28.940 --> 12:41.540
and we can be successful.

12:41.540 --> 12:45.500
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Estes Keifover.

12:45.500 --> 12:50.860
I am seeking a re-election for a second term in the United States Senate.

12:50.860 --> 12:55.500
On this occasion I want to talk with you about the Tennessee Valley Authority, briefly

12:55.500 --> 13:01.100
about what it means to us and about the difficulties with the TVA today.

13:01.100 --> 13:06.460
I'm certain that I don't need to tell any Tennessee audience the wonderful things that

13:06.460 --> 13:12.020
we have gotten from the TVA and what it's done for our great section.

13:12.020 --> 13:16.820
I think the TVA is the finest example of a cooperative effort between government and

13:16.820 --> 13:22.660
the people for the development of the resources of a great section of this nation.

13:22.660 --> 13:26.540
And we should take pride in the fact that whenever any visitors from foreign lands come

13:26.540 --> 13:32.380
to our nation interested in seeing the finest example of democracy and action they always

13:32.380 --> 13:35.980
come first to the Tennessee Valley region.

13:35.980 --> 13:41.940
Well I fought for the TVA back in Chetnigger before I ever got into public life and I

13:41.940 --> 13:47.300
fought hard and made it my principal business to support the TVA both in the House of Representatives

13:47.300 --> 13:50.500
and since I have been in the United States Senate.

13:50.500 --> 13:55.780
When I first came to the House of Representatives in 1939 we were just getting settled.

13:55.780 --> 14:00.540
The matter about the acquisition of the properties of the Commonwealth and Southern, establishing

14:00.540 --> 14:05.500
the TVA service area of which it has today.

14:05.500 --> 14:10.500
And the next problem that came up was the question of tax replacement for the states and counties

14:10.500 --> 14:14.140
of the states in the TVA area.

14:14.140 --> 14:19.620
We got that tax replacement bill through and the counties have been able to go on and

14:19.620 --> 14:26.420
be on a financial sound basis with what the TVA has paid them.

14:26.420 --> 14:31.580
Then I worked as a member of an unofficial committee to get appropriations for the TVA in

14:31.580 --> 14:34.980
the House when we had very, very close votes.

14:34.980 --> 14:39.820
And in the Senate I have been just as active in trying to see that the TVA is protected

14:39.820 --> 14:42.740
and carried on for the benefit of our people.

14:42.740 --> 14:46.180
We know what it's meant to us agriculturally.

14:46.180 --> 14:50.500
Just go around anywhere and see the great improvement in the agriculture and the livestock

14:50.500 --> 14:55.340
and the way our soil is kept and compare it with what it was 20 years ago.

14:55.340 --> 15:00.900
And in industry we have been coming into our own, developing our own industries.

15:00.900 --> 15:08.660
Our product from our manufacturing is worth about six times today, what it was back in 1939.

15:08.660 --> 15:13.740
And this is spread out in all of the various towns and cities of our great state.

15:13.740 --> 15:18.420
And recreation wise, the Tennessee Valley Authority means a whole lot to us.

15:18.420 --> 15:24.340
The TVA is not only a great asset for our section, raising our standard of living and

15:24.340 --> 15:27.380
enabling us to contribute more to the nation.

15:27.380 --> 15:33.580
As a matter of fact, back in 1934 we only paid 3% of the income taxes of the nation.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.140
Now we are paying over 7%.

15:36.140 --> 15:41.580
But it's not only a fine thing for us, it is a tremendous national asset.

15:41.580 --> 15:45.420
Because the things that are made in other parts of the nation we have been able to buy because

15:45.420 --> 15:47.700
we are a fine market.

15:47.700 --> 15:54.620
Also by furnishing power to military installations we have been able to help win the last war

15:54.620 --> 15:58.340
a whole lot more quickly than before.

15:58.340 --> 16:01.620
But today ladies and gentlemen, the TVA is in danger.

16:01.620 --> 16:06.380
This proposal to build a Dixon Yates steam plant and put the TVA at the mercy of the private

16:06.380 --> 16:11.260
power lobby is just an effort to chip away and to destroy the TVA.

16:11.260 --> 16:15.460
But our cause is right, it is made a good record, it's a fine thing.

16:15.460 --> 16:19.620
And I'm going to continue to join others fighting for the life of the TVA.

16:19.620 --> 16:24.580
And in the end we are going to win and save this great agency for the welfare of our people.

16:24.580 --> 16:40.580
And of the nation.

16:40.580 --> 16:43.580
Favouritesism to big business and to special interests.

16:43.580 --> 16:44.580
I'll sit there again.

16:44.580 --> 16:48.580
Keep rolling.

16:48.580 --> 16:53.340
Favouritesism to big business and to special interests has become the watchword of the Eisenhower

16:53.340 --> 16:55.340
administration.

16:55.340 --> 17:00.460
This must give way to a democratic government which will seek a fair balance and an even

17:00.460 --> 17:15.220
balance between industry, agriculture and labor.

17:15.220 --> 17:20.820
The Republicans have substituted bluff, bluster and blunder for responsibility and foreign

17:20.820 --> 17:21.820
affairs.

17:21.820 --> 17:26.780
There is a crying need in the world today for imaginative leadership.

17:26.780 --> 17:44.980
Now the United States in achieving a lasting peace.

17:44.980 --> 17:49.740
To the end that every person in this country can have a fair and even chance.

17:49.740 --> 17:55.580
I stand for square behind the Supreme Court's decision on desegregation.

17:55.580 --> 18:00.540
If I'm elected president I shall do all in my power to bring together men and women

18:00.540 --> 18:07.060
of both races on a bona fide of basis to work out the problems in an atmosphere of trust

18:07.060 --> 18:17.860
and goodwill and justice.

18:17.860 --> 18:21.940
Here in California you have suffered from the Republican administration's failure

18:21.940 --> 18:25.140
to provide adequate flood control.

18:25.140 --> 18:29.980
What we need most is not just relief for the victims of flood, but the prevention of

18:29.980 --> 18:33.580
floods themselves through federal aid.

18:33.580 --> 18:39.740
Harnessing and properly using the waters of our rivers is a necessary part of our program

18:39.740 --> 18:54.700
which I will fight for as I have in the past very, very hard.

18:54.700 --> 19:00.220
We cannot be content merely because some children have good housing, good health facilities

19:00.220 --> 19:02.180
and good schools.

19:02.180 --> 19:07.300
If I'm elected president I shall do all in my power to open the doors of opportunity

19:07.300 --> 19:20.460
for all Americans regardless of race, creed or color.

19:20.460 --> 19:25.620
Although we undeniable have interest in the Arab nations, we cannot let the brave little

19:25.620 --> 19:29.500
republic of Israel be driven into the sea.

19:29.500 --> 19:35.300
We must lend our prestige in seeking a solution of Middle Eastern tensions before it is too

19:35.300 --> 19:36.300
late.

19:36.300 --> 19:41.900
We cannot tolerate a war there which is going to destroy a brave little democracy which

19:41.900 --> 19:53.860
is setting such a fine example for other nations in the world.

19:53.860 --> 19:58.660
Although we undeniable have an interest in the Arab nations, we cannot let the brave

19:58.660 --> 20:02.540
little republic of Israel be driven into the sea.

20:02.540 --> 20:09.500
We must lend our prestige to seeking a solution in Middle East before it is too late and

20:09.500 --> 20:15.180
we must stand by our obligations to the little republic of Israel which is setting such a

20:15.180 --> 20:28.060
fine example for democracy to people in other parts of the world.

20:28.060 --> 20:33.620
The recent quick and arbitrary interstate commerce commission freight rate increase is

20:33.620 --> 20:38.780
losing California's competitive position in eastern and midwestern markets for many

20:38.780 --> 20:40.900
of your products.

20:40.900 --> 20:47.460
If I'm elected president I will do everything I can to restore lower rates to aid the farmers

20:47.460 --> 20:57.140
in the state of California.

20:57.140 --> 21:03.420
Federal senior citizens have a right to adequate social security, disability benefits and

21:03.420 --> 21:05.540
old age assistance.

21:05.540 --> 21:11.140
If I'm elected president I shall continue as I have for seventeen and a half years in

21:11.140 --> 21:25.620
Congress to fight to guarantee you then a fair share of our prosperity.

21:25.620 --> 21:30.940
We in the United States brag about our high standard of living but many of our elderly

21:30.940 --> 21:36.540
citizens have no income at all and are in great need and want.

21:36.540 --> 21:42.340
I am working for HR 7-8-4-8 with which many of you are for measure.

21:42.340 --> 21:48.180
Let's at least enable our old people to get as much as a hundred dollars a month and

21:48.180 --> 22:00.140
let's at least try to reduce the age requirement.

22:00.140 --> 22:06.180
We in America brag about our high standard of living but many of our elderly citizens have

22:06.180 --> 22:10.100
no income and are in great need and want.

22:10.100 --> 22:16.260
I am working hard for HR 7-8-4-8 with which many of you are for measure.

22:16.260 --> 22:21.940
Let's at least try to see that our elderly people get as much as a hundred dollars a month

22:21.940 --> 22:26.760
and let's at least try to see that the age requirement for women is lowered from 65 to

22:26.760 --> 22:33.980
62 and that deserving elderly people all over the nation can at least have a small home

22:33.980 --> 22:37.460
and still draw old age assistance benefits.

22:37.460 --> 22:42.280
I appreciate the leadership and the cause of our elderly people which is being given by

22:42.280 --> 22:49.600
George McLean of the National Institute of Social Welfare and I appreciate their endorsement

22:49.600 --> 23:01.760
and their last convention held in Los Angeles.

23:01.760 --> 23:11.080
The Eisenhower administration's campaign to plow the small farmer under.

23:11.080 --> 23:15.760
The Eisenhower administration's campaign to plow the small farmer under has already

23:15.760 --> 23:19.160
cost California many millions of dollars.

23:19.160 --> 23:24.320
I have consistently defended the interest of the small farmer and will continue to do so

23:24.320 --> 23:26.640
if I am elected president.

23:26.640 --> 23:32.520
I shall work consistently to see that the farmers get a fair full price for the products that

23:32.520 --> 23:36.000
they produce and grow.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.200
The problems of small business have been ignored by the big business administration that

23:43.200 --> 23:47.200
we have to do.

23:47.200 --> 24:00.280
Ladies and gentlemen, Estes Keephover.

24:00.280 --> 24:06.480
How can we pride ourselves on having the highest standard of living in the world when we condemn

24:06.480 --> 24:12.960
our needy ages, our blind and our physically handicapped to exist on an average payment

24:12.960 --> 24:19.680
of less than $58 a month in order to correct this shameful neglect I have proposed in the

24:19.680 --> 24:25.480
United States Senate that the government assume greater responsibility and public assistance

24:25.480 --> 24:29.240
payments to the state so that we can give our American

24:29.240 --> 24:36.240
needy at least $100 a month.

24:59.240 --> 25:17.240
As this session of Congress is coming to an end, it would be of some interest I think

25:17.240 --> 25:23.640
to take stock of just what has happened during these seven months of the new Eisenhower

25:23.640 --> 25:25.600
administration.

25:25.600 --> 25:31.360
On the viewpoint of foreign affairs I think we have had very good success during this time.

25:31.360 --> 25:35.040
Many things have happened which of course Congress and the administration didn't have anything

25:35.040 --> 25:42.400
to do with but which have been much in favor of the chance of fighting communism successfully

25:42.400 --> 25:45.360
and of establishing peace in the world.

25:45.360 --> 25:50.200
Starting with the death of Joseph Stalin and later the inevitable falling out among his

25:50.200 --> 25:56.120
successors leading to the purge of barrier, the revolts in the satellite countries and

25:56.120 --> 26:02.320
particularly the uprisings in East Berlin have had very significant worldwide effects.

26:02.320 --> 26:08.160
I think communism and the Soviet Union has lost much of its political statue and influence

26:08.160 --> 26:12.960
during these seven or eight months and then finally comes the signing of the truce and

26:12.960 --> 26:16.280
the stopping of shooting in Korea proper.

26:16.280 --> 26:19.880
We of course know that this isn't peace, it's only one step.

26:19.880 --> 26:26.320
We hope that a political compromise may be made which will bring hostilities to a conclusion

26:26.320 --> 26:28.280
in that part of the world.

26:28.280 --> 26:34.280
But as President Eisenhower said we would be very foolish indeed if we let down in our

26:34.280 --> 26:40.160
efforts for armament or in our desire for unity with other democratic allies with whom

26:40.160 --> 26:42.040
we must stand.

26:42.040 --> 26:48.760
Now coming to Congress proper I think this Congress may be remembered more for the things

26:48.760 --> 26:55.320
that it didn't do or that it did wrong than for the accomplishments that it made.

26:55.320 --> 26:58.160
We have accomplished some very good things.

26:58.160 --> 27:02.120
The foreign policy generally that we have been pursuing for a number of years has been

27:02.120 --> 27:03.120
continued.

27:03.120 --> 27:08.480
In the field of armaments I think we have kept our defenses in very good shape except

27:08.480 --> 27:13.680
our filthy reduction of the air force was more than justified and that it shouldn't

27:13.680 --> 27:18.640
have been we shouldn't have abandoned our 142 wing program.

27:18.640 --> 27:24.960
In the field of social security we haven't accomplished anything.

27:24.960 --> 27:29.880
Housing has been brought the housing program practically to a standstill.

27:29.880 --> 27:35.560
We in the Tennessee Valley Authority have been very much concerned about the appropriations

27:35.560 --> 27:37.360
for the TVA.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.640
We lost the Fulton Steam planted Memphis.

27:39.640 --> 27:44.800
We came almost very close losing the resource development program of the Tennessee Valley

27:44.800 --> 27:46.320
Authority.

27:46.320 --> 27:51.480
But we did secure an appropriation of more than $180 million for the continuation of

27:51.480 --> 27:57.960
the TVA and we will of course be back fighting for the rest of the program in the next session

27:57.960 --> 27:59.480
of Congress.

27:59.480 --> 28:04.680
But we fired a whole lot better than the other public power organizations did.

28:04.680 --> 28:10.320
The Southwestern Power Authority was slashed very badly as was Bonneville out on the West

28:10.320 --> 28:15.960
Coast and other public power developments throughout the United States.

28:15.960 --> 28:22.720
We are determined that we are going to carry through and continue our campaign in support

28:22.720 --> 28:27.360
of the Tennessee Valley Authority and that we are going to be successful.

28:27.360 --> 28:31.280
One of the great issues that we have had before this Congress has been in connection with

28:31.360 --> 28:34.840
the Tadlin's oil problem.

28:34.840 --> 28:41.640
The Congress has a pasta bill which followed out a campaign pledge of President Eisenhower

28:41.640 --> 28:48.600
to give the oil and the gas and the vast riches in the submerged land off of the coast

28:48.600 --> 28:55.680
of the United States in the so-called continental shelf back to the various states.

28:55.680 --> 29:00.760
I fought this because the Supreme Court of the United States has held seven or eight

29:00.760 --> 29:08.520
times that the land under the continental shelf under the waters of the seas belong to

29:08.520 --> 29:13.520
the people of the nation, all of the nation and not just to the adjacent states.

29:13.520 --> 29:19.600
It will be seen here on this map what the continental shelf is and some places it extends

29:19.600 --> 29:21.920
out very far.

29:21.920 --> 29:27.960
The Congress gave the continental shelf out for three miles to the states except in the

29:27.960 --> 29:34.080
case of Texas and Florida where they gave Texas and Florida ten and a half miles.

29:34.080 --> 29:39.440
By making a fight against the legislation we were able to secure for the people of the

29:39.440 --> 29:43.200
nation that out beyond the ten and a half and the three miles.

29:43.200 --> 29:47.880
We have been trying to get that for education but as this Congress closes it looks like

29:47.880 --> 29:51.160
our cause is lost for the time being.

29:51.160 --> 29:54.760
There are many other matters about this Congress that is known whether we are going to have

29:54.760 --> 30:00.800
to take up legislation to increase the debt limit to $290 billion or not.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.360
That is the final issue that is being determined.

30:21.160 --> 30:35.680
Ladies and gentlemen, as the first of this series of programs we are very happy to have

30:35.680 --> 30:42.560
as our guest today Mr. Walter Stessel who I expect to know is more about Soviet affairs

30:42.560 --> 30:45.240
than any man in the United States.

30:45.240 --> 30:49.840
He is head of the State Department section of Soviet affairs.

30:49.840 --> 30:55.780
Mr. Stessel spent two or three years in New World as with Ambassador Beatles Smith at

30:55.780 --> 30:59.440
Moscow and he has been back several times since then.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.720
Now I thought in view of the tremendous interest that we all have about what is happening behind

31:03.720 --> 31:05.400
the iron curtain.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.000
What is the meaning of the purge of barrier?

31:09.000 --> 31:15.240
Whether there is going to be a disintegration in the leadership of the communist state that

31:15.240 --> 31:20.080
many of these matters are things that we would like for Mr. Stessel to talk about.

31:20.080 --> 31:24.320
We appreciate the fact of course that he has to keep a lot of things off the record

31:24.320 --> 31:29.520
but we will appreciate you telling as much as you can Walter.

31:29.520 --> 31:34.800
What do you personally think or are you in the State Department think was the cause for

31:34.800 --> 31:38.400
the purge of barrier the head of the secret police?

31:38.400 --> 31:42.360
We attribute it mainly to a struggle for power.

31:42.360 --> 31:47.160
I think that is more important than any question of policy.

31:47.160 --> 31:54.040
Do you think that there will be other purges that perhaps Molotov and Malenkov or Bolgondian

31:54.040 --> 31:59.280
the head of the army might fall out and we would have similar situation with happening

31:59.280 --> 32:00.280
in the future?

32:00.280 --> 32:02.040
Well it certainly is possible.

32:02.040 --> 32:08.680
You see in the Soviet Union political changes come about in this rather brutal way of purges

32:08.680 --> 32:11.800
and not through free elections.

32:11.800 --> 32:18.680
Mr. Stessel certainly as to the outside world this indicates that there is some dissension

32:18.680 --> 32:22.880
and tremendous tension in the Soviet Russia.

32:22.880 --> 32:28.240
Do you think that this is going to permanently decrease the strength and the prestige of the

32:28.240 --> 32:31.120
Soviet Union or what will be the result?

32:31.120 --> 32:37.360
Well I think that it is premature to say just what the result will be.

32:37.360 --> 32:42.960
It is certainly possible that the regime will not be weakened in the long run and may

32:42.960 --> 32:44.440
even be strengthened.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.400
How do you mean it might be strengthened?

32:47.400 --> 32:55.440
Well by removing one oppositionist element then the remaining person or persons have their

32:55.440 --> 32:57.520
position strengthened.

32:57.520 --> 33:01.280
Just how powerful was the barrier as head of the secret police?

33:01.280 --> 33:07.320
It seemed to be a rather difficult job to arrest and to take out a power man with great

33:07.320 --> 33:11.000
influence and such as he must have had.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.800
Well that is true Senator.

33:12.800 --> 33:17.520
He had a great deal of control because he controlled one of the sources of armed power

33:17.520 --> 33:19.440
in the Soviet Union.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.760
However it is a question of royalties I think.

33:22.760 --> 33:28.520
This move obviously was planned long in advance and a great deal of detail.

33:28.520 --> 33:35.040
And Marlenkov the man on the other side we presume probably and Dodgerly did have more

33:35.040 --> 33:38.040
royal people than barrier did.

33:38.040 --> 33:45.440
Well barrier had for instance 15,000, I mean 500,000 armed troops, uniform troops.

33:45.440 --> 33:50.000
How do you rest a man with all that many people around it?

33:50.000 --> 33:55.960
Well that is a question we would like to know just how the thing was carried out.

33:55.960 --> 34:01.400
As I said I think it is a question of loyalty and whereas barrier might theoretically have

34:01.400 --> 34:09.320
had control of this great force as it turned out in practice the commanders were not loyal

34:09.320 --> 34:11.200
to barrier.

34:11.200 --> 34:16.400
We have all of Walter got in some had a great deal of interest and some encouragement

34:16.400 --> 34:22.640
out of the revolts in East Germany and Poland and in other places behind the Iron Curtain.

34:22.640 --> 34:26.640
What do you think the meaning of those revolts might be?

34:26.640 --> 34:31.400
Well it certainly shows a great deal of dishonest faction and discontent with Soviet rule in

34:31.400 --> 34:33.600
the part of the satellites.

34:33.600 --> 34:37.440
They want freedom, they don't like their Soviet masters.

34:37.440 --> 34:45.200
I think the spectacle of Soviet tanks attacking East German workers will be a real setback to

34:45.200 --> 34:46.600
international communism.

34:46.600 --> 34:50.080
Well what can we do to exploit this situation?

34:50.080 --> 34:56.000
I think the most important thing is to stand firm with our allies and build strength

34:56.000 --> 34:58.480
in NATO and in EDC.

34:58.480 --> 35:02.880
Well there is nothing in the situation to justify us, disbanding our armed establishment

35:02.880 --> 35:05.920
and each trying to go our own way then.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.680
Certainly not the threat is still there and we shouldn't maintain our strength.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.240
Well thank you Walter it has certainly been good of you to come and be with us and I know

35:14.240 --> 35:17.520
everybody who has seen and heard this program has enjoyed it.

35:17.520 --> 35:21.880
Thank you sir, here is a pleasure.

35:21.880 --> 35:26.240
Ladies and gentlemen I want to talk with you today about a problem that has caused

35:26.240 --> 35:31.080
us in Congress more concern this during this session than almost any issue that we have

35:31.080 --> 35:35.720
had before Congress and indeed before the American people.

35:35.720 --> 35:38.680
And that is the issue of the military budget.

35:38.680 --> 35:43.680
The portion of this budget that has caused us in Congress more soul searching than any other

35:43.680 --> 35:47.120
is that that has to do with the Air Force.

35:47.120 --> 35:51.200
How much air strength is this nation going to have?

35:51.200 --> 35:56.600
The original Air Force budget call for about $16 billion to be expended in the next fiscal

35:56.600 --> 35:57.960
year.

35:57.960 --> 36:03.040
This has been cut by almost $5 billion in the new budget by the new administration.

36:03.040 --> 36:08.640
Now I know that this figure sounds big but I think we ought to consider just what is

36:08.640 --> 36:12.200
involved in this $5 billion cut.

36:12.200 --> 36:17.840
The present strength of our Air Force is 106 wings and I am afraid that in the world today

36:17.840 --> 36:22.560
that we have this second best Air Force which is not good enough.

36:22.560 --> 36:28.520
The communist, communist, Russia and her satellites according to testimony have a better

36:28.520 --> 36:30.680
Air Force than we do.

36:30.680 --> 36:35.800
Our military leaders have set a program which had been agreed to by everybody by all of

36:35.800 --> 36:41.080
the military people and by those who had charge of the security of this nation.

36:41.080 --> 36:50.800
It provided for the development of an Air Force of 143 wings by June 30th, 1954, rather

36:50.800 --> 36:53.240
1955.

36:53.240 --> 37:00.440
Under this new program the total cut, the total Air Force has been cut back to 120 wings

37:00.440 --> 37:07.200
and another bad part about it is that we won't even achieve 120 wings until one year later

37:07.200 --> 37:11.760
June 30th, 1956.

37:11.760 --> 37:16.160
Under this new program let's see some of the wings that are going to be cut out.

37:16.160 --> 37:20.760
Five of the wings to be dropped are the strategic air command.

37:20.760 --> 37:25.880
That has the responsibility as we all know of delivering the atomic bomb to the enemy in

37:25.880 --> 37:28.880
the event we should get into war.

37:28.880 --> 37:33.280
Fifteen of the wings to be dropped are the fighter and fighter bomber wings.

37:33.280 --> 37:37.760
These are the units charged with a defense of the United States and of support for our

37:37.760 --> 37:40.200
ground operations.

37:40.200 --> 37:43.880
Three of the wings to be dropped are the troop carrier wings.

37:43.880 --> 37:49.520
This has to do with the delivering of pair of troopers and it's an integral part of our

37:49.520 --> 37:56.480
air operations even though they use transport rather than combat planes.

37:56.480 --> 38:01.320
These are all in favor and I think we all are of cutting out all of the fat in the military

38:01.320 --> 38:02.520
budget.

38:02.520 --> 38:07.680
But this seems to be muscle not fat because it's an actual reduction in the number of air

38:07.680 --> 38:10.400
wings that we're going to have.

38:10.400 --> 38:16.320
I have reached the conclusion reluctantly that these cuts are made on budgetary rather

38:16.320 --> 38:19.200
than upon military consideration.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.280
I've reached that conclusion for several reasons.

38:22.280 --> 38:28.240
The first is that the military advice of the joint chiefs of staff was not asked about

38:28.240 --> 38:29.840
this reduction.

38:29.880 --> 38:34.200
They were not requested to give their views as to the effect of the cut.

38:34.200 --> 38:39.880
And as a matter of fact, the final figures were not available to them until just 36 hours

38:39.880 --> 38:46.360
before they were directed to go up to Congress and testify in support of this reduced air

38:46.360 --> 38:47.840
force.

38:47.840 --> 38:52.920
And the second part is that the director of the budget wrote Mr. Wilson, the Secretary

38:52.920 --> 38:57.600
of Defense, a letter saying that this was the figure.

38:57.600 --> 39:02.800
It was a budgetary cut and that he should have to cut down the number of the size of

39:02.800 --> 39:05.040
our air force to meet it.

39:05.040 --> 39:10.480
And Mr. Wilson and Mr. Kies, who has charge of the budget and the defense department, both

39:10.480 --> 39:16.280
testified that they were surprised that such a large cut was to be made in the air force.

39:16.280 --> 39:21.880
They said that the surprise came that the heaviest cuts were to be in the air force.

39:21.880 --> 39:27.080
And furthermore, no one has told us and that there's no proof that the world situation

39:27.080 --> 39:30.600
has any less tense or difficult or dangerous.

39:30.600 --> 39:36.840
As a matter of fact, President Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles have both said that if anything

39:36.840 --> 39:40.680
we faced a more dangerous situation than before.

39:40.680 --> 39:46.760
And the next reason that I feel that we should not so drastically cut the air force is that

39:46.760 --> 39:53.760
a very substantial and influential group of military men upon whom we must have confidence

39:53.760 --> 40:02.400
have appeared and spoken very strongly in favor of continuing the 143 wing program.

40:02.400 --> 40:08.800
These include General Bradley, General Collins, Admiral Fleckner, General Ridgeway, and

40:08.800 --> 40:17.560
General Twining, the new chief of the air force staff, appointed by President Eisenhower.

40:17.560 --> 40:22.080
So that I do hope that we will not again have too little security at a time when the United

40:22.080 --> 40:24.080
States must be strong.

40:24.080 --> 40:36.280
I'm going to talk with you in person, but I do appreciate this opportunity of you letting

40:36.280 --> 40:39.560
me come and join your group.

40:39.560 --> 40:45.800
I'm going about Tennessee reporting on federal problems as they affect the people of this

40:45.800 --> 40:46.800
state.

40:46.800 --> 40:51.840
I also try and define ways and means that I can be a better service to the people and to

40:51.840 --> 40:52.840
the state of Tennessee.

40:52.840 --> 40:58.800
I hope that I may be able to see you when I'm around your way, but if I don't get to

40:58.800 --> 41:04.440
see you in person then, I want you to know that you can always write me at 404 Senate

41:04.440 --> 41:09.760
Office Building in Washington or call me on the telephone and I'm glad to try to be

41:09.760 --> 41:12.080
of service if I can possibly be.

41:12.080 --> 41:20.960
Well, of course, as to the YouTube incident, I think one of the things there is we must

41:20.960 --> 41:28.840
consider, if we assert the right to flower other countries with spy planes, they can

41:28.840 --> 41:30.960
assert the right to flower our country.

41:30.960 --> 41:37.160
And I think that Cuban planes coming over us and airplanes going over Israel and Russian

41:37.160 --> 41:42.160
planes coming over the United States and ours going over there as we can see what a

41:42.160 --> 41:43.160
grave.

41:43.160 --> 41:48.840
Not only I think it's not very well-morrowed and justified, but I think we can see what

41:48.840 --> 41:51.960
a great risk we'd be taking.

41:51.960 --> 41:56.600
Of course, we might well think that this was an all-out atomic attack or they might think

41:56.600 --> 42:00.600
so and they nuclear war would be on.

42:00.600 --> 42:07.640
So far, in our geophysical year, we have considered space to belong not to any particular nation

42:07.640 --> 42:09.840
but to all of the world.

42:09.840 --> 42:15.640
And certain that some of the satellites, the Russians, of course, they have said so, have

42:15.640 --> 42:21.040
been orbit going around, have been taking pictures and images, messages sending them

42:21.040 --> 42:22.040
back.

42:22.040 --> 42:27.840
I was having been doing the same thing and there seems to be a general recognition of the

42:27.840 --> 42:32.240
fact that space belongs as of this time to no particular nation.

42:32.240 --> 42:38.880
I do hope some formal convention may be reached on that purpose on that basis.

42:38.880 --> 42:46.960
But I think that that's a great deal more justified than flying planes close over the

42:46.960 --> 42:48.640
land of some nation.

42:48.640 --> 42:53.200
Earlier under the key fall, this week, President Eisenhower vetoed the depressed areas bill

42:53.200 --> 42:56.160
and the Senate failed to override that veto.

42:56.160 --> 43:01.280
How would that measure have affected Tennessee and are there any plans for a compromise?

43:01.280 --> 43:06.120
Don, the stressed areas bill was intended to work this way.

43:06.840 --> 43:12.280
There are some towns and some communities, some rural sections where the industry or the

43:12.280 --> 43:17.520
employment has moved away from the people living there, leaving them just living there in their

43:17.520 --> 43:24.560
homes, unable to find jobs or untrain to do some of the jobs that might be around.

43:24.560 --> 43:29.160
For instance, in coal mining sections where we have many of them in the east and middle

43:29.160 --> 43:33.880
Tennessee, the coal has been depleted but the people are still there.

43:33.880 --> 43:36.640
There's nothing more demoralizing than that.

43:36.640 --> 43:42.680
What this stressed areas bill would have done was to set up an area redevelopment agency

43:42.680 --> 43:49.960
with a capital of $250 million to be loaned at a low rate of interest for the purpose of

43:49.960 --> 43:55.440
getting industries into this section, into these sections of retraining people so that they

43:55.440 --> 44:01.560
could work in these industries, of helping them with their housing redevelopment and their

44:01.560 --> 44:02.560
sewage problems.

44:02.560 --> 44:07.960
In other words, restoring the community and making it livable where they are.

44:07.960 --> 44:12.760
My feeling about it is that we need to catch up in our national production.

44:12.760 --> 44:19.440
It's shameful, I think, for demoralizing for people who want to work to have nothing

44:19.440 --> 44:23.680
to do so that I thought it was a very good bill.

44:31.560 --> 44:40.400
I'm Senator S. Keefeau, of Tennessee.

44:40.400 --> 44:46.760
We have just completed here in Washington the fifth annual conference of NATO parliamentarians

44:46.760 --> 44:51.960
in which the members of the Congress or the parliament from the 15 NATO countries have

44:51.960 --> 44:58.040
met in Washington, this being the fifth meeting, to discuss ways and means of strengthening

44:58.040 --> 45:03.480
our NATO organization, which has been the bulwark against the aggression of communism

45:03.480 --> 45:09.240
and which has brought about unity and cooperation to some extent at least among the nations

45:09.240 --> 45:10.240
of the North Atlantic.

45:10.240 --> 45:16.840
We're privileged to have two very distinguished parliamentarians and members of this conference

45:16.840 --> 45:19.720
with us who will discuss some of the problems.

45:19.720 --> 45:26.760
I would first like to introduce Mr. Henry Fiaia, a member of the Chamber of Deputies of Belgium

45:26.840 --> 45:33.000
and a very distinguished member who is serving as the chairman of the political committee

45:33.000 --> 45:34.760
of the NATO parliamentarians.

45:34.760 --> 45:44.000
Before calling on Henry for any remarks, I want to introduce an old friend, Ms. Henderson,

45:44.000 --> 45:52.080
a member of the parliament of Great Britain and a very great friend of us here in the United

45:52.080 --> 46:00.080
States, who is one of the originators in the NATO partner, NATO work.

46:00.080 --> 46:06.200
First, Mr. Fiaia, as a member of the political committee, will you tell us something about

46:06.200 --> 46:11.920
the important work of this committee and the resolutions that were passed?

46:11.920 --> 46:21.520
We have come to the conclusion that one of the overall considerations,

46:21.520 --> 46:31.160
with regard to the world situation, now is that there is an ever-increasing need of very

46:31.160 --> 46:37.640
intimate cooperation between our nations in NATO.

46:37.640 --> 46:47.240
The burden of armaments to ensure our security is so great that no single nation can

46:47.240 --> 46:54.120
anymore think of ensuring its security by its own means and there is already the basis

46:54.120 --> 46:57.960
for a very sound and very helpful cooperation.

46:57.960 --> 47:04.400
But also with the developments that are at hand now, one can clearly see that when it

47:04.400 --> 47:12.400
comes to political consultations, the devising of attitudes or economic policies that you

47:12.400 --> 47:19.360
need intimate consultation all along between all the members of NATO and is also one of the

47:19.360 --> 47:24.160
outstanding lessons that we've learned during our debates here.

47:24.160 --> 47:29.200
And Mr. Harrison, will you tell us some of your feelings about this problem?

47:29.200 --> 47:35.880
Well, I have been particularly impressed by the unanimity we achieved this morning in

47:35.880 --> 47:42.600
the Clean Recession in support of proposals put forward by the political committee for

47:42.600 --> 47:43.600
disarmament.

47:43.600 --> 47:48.160
Now, let me make it quite clear, when we talk about disarmament, we do not mean unilateral

47:48.160 --> 47:49.520
disarmament.

47:49.520 --> 47:56.760
We realize that the military, the overwhelming nuclear power that is at the disposal of the

47:56.760 --> 48:02.440
United States and my own country, as well as the military power of those associated with

48:02.440 --> 48:09.160
a NATO, gives us this powerful shield against any attempted aggression on the part of the

48:09.160 --> 48:11.720
Soviet Union or any other country.

48:11.720 --> 48:18.160
And even though the Soviet Union may have comparable military power, nonetheless it does not weaken

48:18.160 --> 48:20.080
this great deterrent.

48:20.080 --> 48:26.040
But the world, in my view, and I think obviously in the view of the conference, cannot go on

48:26.040 --> 48:28.160
indefinitely on present levels.

48:28.160 --> 48:33.840
And therefore we support the proposals for an attempt being made to secure either a

48:33.840 --> 48:39.280
limitation or we hope even substantial reduction all round.

48:39.280 --> 48:45.400
And I, for one, I believe all three of us are in complete agreement as to the great importance

48:45.400 --> 48:52.080
of the projected summit conference, if only to test the sincerity of Mr. Krushchev and

48:52.080 --> 48:58.160
his associates when they say they would favor a policy of securing total disarmament within

48:58.160 --> 48:59.160
the next two years.

48:59.160 --> 49:05.040
But gentlemen, the both of you feel that, in view of the fact that we are now in an economic

49:05.040 --> 49:10.720
and political contest that it's necessary that we find ways and means of better cooperation

49:10.720 --> 49:13.680
among the democracies of the NATO organization.

49:13.680 --> 49:14.680
Absolutely, essentially.

49:14.680 --> 49:18.080
And is that what you have done made such a big contribution?

49:18.080 --> 49:24.160
That's why we think that our NATO parliamentarians' conferences can help the governments

49:24.160 --> 49:28.640
to find a way of broadening common understanding.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.640
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Faya.

49:30.640 --> 49:35.240
I am Mr. Henderson for being on this program and talking about NATO.

49:35.240 --> 49:35.920
That's all for now.

49:48.080 --> 50:08.080
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I am Estes Keef over.

50:08.080 --> 50:13.560
I'm speaking to you from the NATO Parliamentary Conference in Paris France.

50:13.560 --> 50:18.560
This is a meeting of a delegate selected by the Congresses and Parliament of the 15

50:18.560 --> 50:19.560
NATO countries.

50:19.560 --> 50:25.080
I accepted appointment as a member of the United States delegation because I believe this

50:25.080 --> 50:32.760
meeting is of vital importance to our own safety at home and through the NATO organization

50:32.760 --> 50:40.400
and I offer to have solidarity among the nations of the North Atlantic, Western Europe,

50:40.400 --> 50:42.480
and of the United States.

50:42.480 --> 50:46.960
As we have met here, two Sputniks have been constantly encircling the globe which reminds

50:46.960 --> 50:54.880
us of the scientific contest that we are engaged in today with the communist world and of the

50:54.880 --> 51:01.680
necessity of the people who believe in freedom, democracy, decency, joining together as closely

51:01.680 --> 51:03.680
as possible.

51:03.680 --> 51:09.760
Furthermore, in December just three weeks from now, the NATO Council, the heads of states,

51:09.760 --> 51:13.760
will meet here in the same building in Paris France.

51:13.760 --> 51:18.760
We feel that the suggestions and the work of the Parliamentarians will be helpful in paving

51:18.760 --> 51:19.760
the way for them.

51:19.760 --> 51:26.120
I'm very proud to have with me today a very distinguished delegate, a member of Parliament

51:26.120 --> 51:31.000
from the United Kingdom, Mr. Jeffrey Diffrater.

51:31.000 --> 51:40.200
Mr. Diffrater, let me say, is one of the outstanding and great men in the Parliament of our

51:40.200 --> 51:44.840
friend and our great friend and ally, great Britain.

51:44.840 --> 51:51.160
One of these days, Mr. Diffrater's will probably be the Secretary of Air or the Secretary of

51:51.160 --> 51:55.000
Defense, he is a leading member of Parliament.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.040
Mr. Diffrater's and I have had the pleasure of serving together on the so-called political

52:00.040 --> 52:03.760
committee of the NATO Parliamentary Association.

52:03.760 --> 52:06.040
His position is that of rapporteur.

52:06.040 --> 52:11.240
Now that is a word that's not function is not used.

52:11.240 --> 52:16.120
We don't know much about it in the United States, but it means that he is the chief man

52:16.120 --> 52:22.240
on the committee that he prepares the report and he prepared an excellent political report

52:22.240 --> 52:28.080
that he gets the consensus of opinion about the resolutions and the proposals to be made

52:28.080 --> 52:32.980
that he then drafts the proposals and it takes the lead in the debate and has done

52:32.980 --> 52:40.240
it splendidly when they proposals or the resolutions come before the general session

52:40.240 --> 52:43.560
of the NATO Parliamentary Conference.

52:43.560 --> 52:49.440
And it's been very remarkable that all of our resolutions were accepted unanimously

52:49.440 --> 52:56.720
and that's due to great extent to define draftsmanship and explanations and to the standing

52:56.720 --> 53:00.400
and influence of my friend here, Mr. Diffrater's.

53:00.400 --> 53:03.720
So, we are happy to have you on this program, Jeffrey.

53:03.720 --> 53:05.720
Thank you very much, Charles.

53:05.720 --> 53:14.320
Let me ask, are you, um, bent to the United States a great deal and, yes, I have.

53:14.320 --> 53:17.560
I've actually been in 47 now to the 48 states.

53:17.560 --> 53:22.280
Well, then I know if you've been in 47 now to the 48, you must have been through the

53:22.280 --> 53:23.960
great volunteer state of Tennessee.

53:23.960 --> 53:24.960
I have.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.960
I wouldn't have died columnist program if I'd been through that as the one I'd missed.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.800
And, uh, when was it you were there, Jeffrey in Tennessee?

53:31.800 --> 53:34.960
Well, in Tennessee that was, um, in 1935.

53:34.960 --> 53:38.320
Well, I must have been a very, very young man at that time.

53:38.320 --> 53:42.240
Well, I was studying at Yale at the time and so I had a look at the south.

53:42.240 --> 53:47.840
Well, I went to school at Yale and I'm not saying I'm much of a study, but, uh, okay.

53:47.840 --> 53:52.880
And I think you, uh, also married a very lovely American girl.

53:52.880 --> 53:54.480
I did, I did so.

53:54.480 --> 53:59.760
Well, we have a lot in common and certainly are happy to have Mr. Fredas as our guest today.

53:59.760 --> 54:04.480
Well, you tell us, uh, what you think about the work of the conference and, uh, the

54:04.480 --> 54:06.280
importance of the conference, Jeffrey.

54:06.280 --> 54:11.240
Well, I'm, uh, one of the most important features of the fact that Senator Keith Irving was

54:11.240 --> 54:15.840
elected chairman of the political committee, the committee, he's referred to.

54:15.840 --> 54:20.560
You see, before you go off, I wanted to just tell the, uh, my friends in Tennessee that

54:20.560 --> 54:21.560
I didn't put you up to.

54:21.560 --> 54:22.560
No, thanks a lot.

54:22.560 --> 54:28.040
I know that, but you, rather, built me up a little bit by saying I was the most important

54:28.040 --> 54:29.040
man in the committee.

54:29.040 --> 54:32.880
I just wanted to make it, uh, straight, uh, Senator Keith Irving was elected chairman by

54:32.880 --> 54:34.600
the 15 countries and it's true.

54:34.600 --> 54:35.920
I was rapporteur.

54:35.920 --> 54:40.680
But that meant to see that as rapporteur this committee, I had to work very closely with

54:40.680 --> 54:46.080
the chairman, so I've seen a, uh, good deal of, uh, uh, I, I, I, I, I, I have, I've had

54:46.080 --> 54:47.160
it during the last few days.

54:47.160 --> 54:51.680
I think the most important point that we've done is to, uh, uh, one of the most important

54:51.680 --> 55:00.800
things we've decided was to accept the resolution looking right ahead to the conference,

55:00.800 --> 55:07.000
governmental conference, to study the Atlantic community and what it really was based on.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
Well, uh, Jeffrey, in that connection, we have a political committee reported two resolutions.

55:13.000 --> 55:18.880
Um, first was how they, to have, uh, this NATO parliamentary association be the nucleus

55:18.880 --> 55:26.800
around which a great citizens Congress, uh, would be held in 1959, the 10th anniversary

55:26.800 --> 55:30.200
of the NATO treaty, uh, North Atlantic treaty.

55:30.200 --> 55:35.640
This would be in the nature of a hate conference, I believe, uh, will you tell us how you envisioned

55:35.640 --> 55:38.000
a, uh, yes, great conference.

55:38.000 --> 55:44.880
And the, uh, and 959 being the anniversary of 10th anniversary, we'd have a, uh, get together

55:44.880 --> 55:52.320
of all people representing institutions, organizations, and so on, who are interested in bringing

55:52.320 --> 55:55.680
the countries around the Atlantic closer together.

55:55.680 --> 55:58.240
And they would have a, the, the discuss it.

55:58.240 --> 56:03.480
10 years ago, there was a similar conference, um, in Europe, and it had a great, it has,

56:03.480 --> 56:07.760
had a great results in making European nations realize how much they have in common,

56:07.760 --> 56:09.080
I'm, I'm, I'm very important.

56:09.080 --> 56:14.440
I believe the hate conference in 1948, which Mr. Churchill and, uh, great minute distinguished

56:14.440 --> 56:20.880
Europeans, uh, were present and spoke, I resulted in the Strasbourg, the creation of the Council

56:20.880 --> 56:25.920
of Europe and many other, a very worthwhile things that have been done to bring the European

56:25.920 --> 56:26.920
community together.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.760
And that, yes, it did.

56:28.760 --> 56:33.920
And that Council of Europe has provided twice a year opportunity for members of parliament

56:33.920 --> 56:37.520
of different countries in Europe to meet and discuss common problems.

56:37.520 --> 56:42.480
They don't, they can't take any executive action, but they can, uh, the different points

56:42.480 --> 56:43.480
of view.

56:43.480 --> 56:49.840
And I think we also envision this, uh, hate, uh, conference on the 10th anniversary of

56:49.840 --> 56:56.320
the North Atlantic Treaty to, uh, from, uh, be a time for people back home to talk about

56:56.320 --> 57:02.600
and think about and study, uh, NATO problems, the problems of the Atlantic community.

57:02.600 --> 57:08.000
Because we realize that NATO will only be as strong and, and as effective as it, uh, has

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
backing from the people.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.880
And this will be a time of mobilization of that public backing.

57:13.880 --> 57:20.440
The, uh, other, uh, the other, uh, part of this, uh, very important resolution is something

57:20.440 --> 57:25.860
that I've been wishing on for a long, long time in the Congress of the United States or

57:25.860 --> 57:26.860
similar to it.

57:26.860 --> 57:33.880
And that is to set up a conference or a commission, uh, the delegates of which would be selected

57:33.880 --> 57:40.700
by the respective 15 governments of NATO to, uh, seriously study and to recommend ways

57:40.700 --> 57:49.520
and means of implementing and, uh, the NATO idea of bringing about better cooperation

57:49.520 --> 57:52.520
unity among the nations of the North Atlantic.

57:52.520 --> 57:58.320
I'm very hopeful at, uh, at the meeting here in December that President Eisenhower and

57:58.320 --> 58:01.960
the other heads of state may, uh, implement this resolution.

58:01.960 --> 58:04.280
What do you think about this, this general idea?

58:04.280 --> 58:05.800
I think it's a statement.

58:05.800 --> 58:08.680
I think it, the two of them thinking very well.

58:08.680 --> 58:13.280
One is the big Congress and this other one.

58:13.280 --> 58:18.240
I, I believe that the government's meeting next month when everyone's, this well aware

58:18.240 --> 58:24.920
of importance now, um, of NATO and this alliance that they will go forward and set up such

58:24.920 --> 58:25.920
a conference.

58:25.920 --> 58:30.600
Everything to me that in a three-day meeting such as, uh, this will be, uh, three weeks

58:30.600 --> 58:36.680
from now with heads of government here that, uh, they can only agree upon general principles

58:36.680 --> 58:42.840
that the implementation that details will have to be worked out by commission or, uh,

58:42.840 --> 58:48.920
conference and, uh, this, uh, recommendation, uh, hope will fit what they may do at that time

58:48.920 --> 58:53.160
and I know that there's no harm at least from talking things over.

58:53.160 --> 58:59.240
Uh, Jeffrey, we had, uh, one incident in the conference, uh, unfortunate one growing

58:59.240 --> 59:06.480
out of the, uh, decision of the United Kingdom and the United States to send the arms to

59:06.480 --> 59:07.480
the nation of Tunisia.

59:07.480 --> 59:10.920
Will you, uh, tell us what happened here next and then?

59:10.920 --> 59:16.760
Well, it's, it's, uh, we're, we're in France and you only have to be here to realize how

59:16.760 --> 59:23.920
extremely touchy the French are about anything that appears to be helping the nationalists

59:23.920 --> 59:25.960
in Algeria.

59:25.960 --> 59:32.480
And, of course, this has been construed in the way that it, the, the legs that arm would

59:32.480 --> 59:38.680
go from Tunisia into Algeria and, of course, the emotions of very jarred off of old French

59:38.680 --> 59:42.000
hair people, fighting where I'd be killed out.

59:42.000 --> 59:47.200
And one manifestation of it was that the French derigation here, all the French members of

59:47.200 --> 59:54.280
Parliament, um, as a protest against the action of the two governments, the British and American,

59:54.280 --> 59:55.920
left the conference walk right out.

59:55.920 --> 59:59.960
It's my opinion, it was a silly thing to do because you gained nothing by walking out,

59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.120
but just not there to put your point of view.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:07.440
Uh, yes, well, I certainly agree that, uh, walking out doesn't do any good and, uh, as you

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.600
say, they can be more effective if they stay in the meeting and, uh, present their point

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.600
of view.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.600
And, uh, I think it's fair to say that there's a great deal of sympathy with the French

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.600
position.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.080
Uh, I can certainly understand how they feel about it.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:29.120
Uh, I believe that one, uh, thing that was not done in this connection and I think this

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:35.320
was a mistake, uh, not to have done it was that, uh, the members of NATO, the NATO ministerial

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:42.800
council and Mr. Paul Enre's, Bob, the, uh, Secretary General of NATO was not, he was not

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.800
informed.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.760
There was no consultation between the members.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.440
So that this is, uh, one of those things that is disrupted our unity and it is something

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:57.400
that should have been discussed all the way around, uh, by the NATO ministerial, uh, group

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.000
before any action was taken because France is a great and precious friend of the United

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.640
States and the United Kingdom and we don't want anything to happen that's going to permanently

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:15.120
disrupt your eye or cause a, uh, this unity with, uh, France, we certainly hope they will

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.620
come back in the conference and I hope that in the future that our State Department may,

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.480
uh, hell of matters differently.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.800
I'm not very, I doubt very much the wisdom of what they did, but certainly the way they

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.800
did it was bad.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.800
Yes.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.360
Well, Devere, will you tell us some of the other, uh, outstanding achievements of this, uh,

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.360
conference?

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.560
So, on that very point, of course, we passed our committee off of the resolution, which

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.800
was accepted unanimously, just, just, um, this morning on this very matter.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.240
Uh, that is to say, the importance, stressing the importance of consultation between the nations.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.640
And then, uh, well, the scientific point, I think that's an important one, but yes,

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.600
why don't you say a word about the, uh, scientific?

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.960
Well, it's just that we've all, we've accepted the resolution of the Bay Deal of Pooling of

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.840
scientific and technical manpower among the NATO countries.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.200
The general principle is there.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.720
It's up to us to implement it.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.920
That was, uh, really an implementation of our President Eisenhower and Prime Minister

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.480
Macmillan agreed upon in Washington sometime back.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.160
And that, uh, report incidentally was presented by Senator Henry Jackson from the state of

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.400
Washington, who is a great friend of us in Tennessee.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.000
Well, uh, and Jeffrey, this is about all the time we have.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.600
We want to extend you a welcome to come down to our state.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.880
Uh, we hope you will come down and see the Tennessee Valley Authority again, like you.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.880
And, uh, we'll be very happy to see you and it's been a great pleasure to be on this

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.880
program.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.880
Thanks very much.
