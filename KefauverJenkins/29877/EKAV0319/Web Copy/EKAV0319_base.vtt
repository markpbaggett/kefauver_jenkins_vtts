00:30.000 --> 00:51.760
I'm Frank Blair speaking for the editors of Life magazine. At the invitation of the Gulf

00:51.760 --> 00:56.720
Oil Company, the life editors for the next three months in their lively and formative

00:56.720 --> 01:03.120
and provocative way are covering the important events of the 1952 presidential campaigns for

01:03.120 --> 01:09.440
We the People. Tonight it's the battle for the South or the bigger battle within the Democratic

01:09.440 --> 01:14.960
Party. We'll take you direct to Senator Esther's key fovers, headquarters in the Raleigh Hotel

01:14.960 --> 01:19.920
in Washington. You'll meet Senator key fover and those who are working hard to put him in the White

01:19.920 --> 01:24.960
House. One of his most important helpers of course is Mrs. Nancy key fover. She'll be there with her

01:24.960 --> 01:31.120
husband. And for the first time on a television network you will see an exclusive film made by the

01:31.120 --> 01:37.200
march of time of an historic debate between Senator key fover and Senator Richard Russell of Georgia.

01:37.760 --> 01:42.320
We'll bring you the battle for the South in just a moment. Right now Bill Rogers has a word for you.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.840
Hi there. You know the heat of an election year shows that Americans think pretty hard before

01:47.840 --> 01:53.040
casting their votes. They seriously consider a candidate from every possible angle. What does he

01:53.040 --> 01:58.240
stand for? What about his record of past performance and will he wear well over the long haul?

01:58.800 --> 02:04.160
Yes those are all good questions and questions that demand proof too. And when Mr. American gets

02:04.160 --> 02:10.160
his proof then he'll make up his mind, make up his choice and stay with it. You know that's

02:10.160 --> 02:15.680
pretty much the story of Gulf Pride HD. Gulf's amazing new high detergency motor oil.

02:16.240 --> 02:22.560
Ever since Gulf Pride HD was introduced last spring Americans more and more of them have tried it

02:22.560 --> 02:28.560
and stayed with it because Gulf Pride HD has proved it can do exactly what it says it can do.

02:28.880 --> 02:33.120
Keep your engine remarkably clean under all driving conditions.

02:34.560 --> 02:40.240
Yes Gulf Pride HD will keep your engine clean no matter what kind of driving you do on long

02:40.240 --> 02:46.480
vacation trips or during your everyday driving. Those short trips that dirty up an engine worse than

02:46.480 --> 02:52.640
any other kind of driving. Now when your engine gets dirty it can cause trouble and result in

02:52.640 --> 02:58.640
expensive repair bills. Piston rings get gummy hydraulic valve lifters stick and you may use more oil.

02:59.440 --> 03:05.200
But when there's Gulf Pride HD in your crankcase your engine stays clean and runs better.

03:05.200 --> 03:12.560
So friends on long trips or short trips keep Gulf Pride HD in your crankcase and keep your engine clean.

03:13.200 --> 03:20.960
Stop at the sign of the Gulf Orange Disc and ask for Gulf Pride HD. You can't buy a better motor oil.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.040
It's the finest in the field.

03:25.680 --> 03:32.080
And here's Frank Blair again. Thank you. Before Senator Estes Kiefov or any other Democrat can get

03:32.080 --> 03:38.160
his party's nomination he's got to think long and hard about the solid stuff. But the

03:38.160 --> 03:43.680
South hasn't been solidly democratic since Harry Truman was nominated and reelected in 1948

03:44.320 --> 03:50.560
in Congress and out of it. Southerners are thinking more and more and are becoming more disturbed

03:50.560 --> 03:58.640
by a Truman spare deal policies. And no issue has created more opposition in the South than the FEPC

03:59.440 --> 04:07.200
which the president strongly endorses. The FEPC is a proposed bill. If it is enacted into law

04:07.200 --> 04:12.080
it would require that anyone seeking employment should be given equal consideration for

04:12.080 --> 04:18.560
opposition regardless of race, color or creed. Employers would not be permitted to discriminate

04:18.560 --> 04:23.760
between applicants of equal ability and experience because of race, color or creed.

04:24.800 --> 04:32.960
In 1948 when the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia officially endorsed the FEPC a group of

04:32.960 --> 04:37.280
Southern delegates electrified the Convention with a dramatic decision.

04:40.320 --> 04:51.440
Without hatred, without anger, without will, but with disillusionment and disappointment

04:52.720 --> 05:02.080
we are faced with the necessity to walk out of this Convention and return to Alabama.

05:03.600 --> 05:10.640
The FEPC is a very important and important part of the FEPC.

05:19.120 --> 05:24.320
During that Hectic-48 Democratic Convention the rebellious delegates from the Southern

05:24.320 --> 05:30.400
States met in caucus to reassure themselves that the Southern bloc stood united in the revolt

05:30.400 --> 05:36.560
against the party. Ladies and gentlemen of the Convention of the South.

05:39.280 --> 05:44.640
I am a Kentuckyan. I'm married a Mississippian.

05:50.320 --> 05:59.520
And the blood that flows through my children is Mississippi and Kentucky blood.

06:00.960 --> 06:08.560
Now you know we've gathered here this afternoon to discuss some serious problems we certainly have.

06:09.520 --> 06:15.280
Now I'm a Democrat I certainly am and being a Democrat I think I've got the right to

06:15.280 --> 06:24.160
little root my own jackass I certainly have. I hear some people say that I'm against Truman but I

06:24.160 --> 06:32.080
can't leave the party. My dear friends let me remind you of this. You're not leaving the party.

06:32.080 --> 06:40.000
The party has already left you. As oh a Southern delegation speaking out of deep and long

06:40.000 --> 06:46.720
held feeling left the Democratic Party went back down south and founded the Dixie Crats in 1948.

06:46.720 --> 06:53.600
Will there be a split in the Democratic Party in 1952? As it faces its toughest competition in 20

06:53.600 --> 07:00.240
years two men could break the party wide open. They are Senator Richard Russell of Georgia and

07:00.240 --> 07:07.360
Senator Estus Kefover of Tennessee. Senator Russell has the traditional Southern attitude toward the

07:07.360 --> 07:15.680
vital FEPC bill and his only visible support is the Southern Democratic machine. Senator Kefover

07:15.680 --> 07:21.520
has been acquiring delegates in the North because he refuses to accept Southern tradition.

07:22.080 --> 07:28.000
For the first time on a television network we bring you the highlights of a free swinging face to

07:28.000 --> 07:33.600
face and cover between these two senators. Filmed especially by the March of Time and exclusive

07:33.600 --> 07:39.840
account of Democratic presidential candidates Kefover and Russell battling over issues which can tear

07:39.840 --> 07:40.800
the South apart.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.640
Well I don't feel as you've made any headway uh you're carrying any space just Senator.

07:48.640 --> 07:52.800
Well I had to do the work I had to hold the water and touch the wood back there in Washington.

07:53.600 --> 07:59.040
Got my good friend who remember my committee wasn't there he was all campaigning over the country

07:59.040 --> 08:04.080
and I someone had to do the work we had to get these bills out of the committee.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.320
Oh let me just say a little word about that.

08:06.320 --> 08:10.160
And as soon as they were sitting. Let me just say a little word about that. I think you'll agree

08:10.160 --> 08:14.240
that since the time I've been on the armed services maybe I've been a pretty faithful member.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.640
I kept a word I just don't know. I kept a word I asked Kefover.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.640
Oh he asked me with that statement.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.280
Well I don't want to embarrass you Senator I don't know.

08:23.280 --> 08:29.040
That's pretty thing in the world but uh well just a minute now let me tell you something.

08:29.760 --> 08:34.240
But I think that anybody who's going to offer themselves for the presidency of the United States

08:35.120 --> 08:39.760
always the duties to go before the people and all the questions of the nation and talk about issues

08:40.560 --> 08:45.520
across the people who've got a right to do the choosing and uh I think that they ought to have more

08:45.520 --> 08:50.240
of a safe zone. I think it's a great educational process. I think it's just as necessary for

08:50.240 --> 08:56.640
candidates to get in prime areas to go before the people for selecting their party nominees as

08:56.640 --> 09:02.320
it is to say uh vote in the general election. We need more democracy so I wouldn't feel right

09:02.320 --> 09:08.160
running for the president unless I took advantage of the various prime areas over the nation and

09:08.160 --> 09:13.120
entered them submitted myself either for the us who know goes one way or the other.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.920
That's what I've done because I think that's what I should do.

09:15.920 --> 09:21.440
Well you carry out your convictions very well and I have no complaint to make about that.

09:22.240 --> 09:30.080
I did not was not able to enter all of these prime areas and uh I do not feel at this and come

09:30.080 --> 09:34.160
but only any candidate to enter the prime areas if he feels he has a very responsible

09:34.160 --> 09:38.320
deal in Washington. I have an idea though that you're not nearly as concerned the

09:38.320 --> 09:43.200
about the prime areas that I didn't add us as you all the more than I did enter here in Florida.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.560
Oh of course I can't say on one that's us giving me some distance.

09:46.560 --> 09:51.280
I'm doing pretty well here at least Senator Russell uh during that time you've been well

09:51.280 --> 09:55.040
Florida during the time you've been in Florida I've been running in two other prime areas

09:55.040 --> 09:59.920
in Ohio and Maryland which I think you should have shared your time between those three like I have.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.400
Well it might have been it might look that way but then you had the badger me you've been

10:04.400 --> 10:07.760
Florida some two or three times before I came down for two days.

10:07.760 --> 10:13.840
Well you've been here before and I have been here at 10 campaigning days in all and uh I

10:14.960 --> 10:21.600
feel that uh I was entitled to enter here in Florida if I wait and I know that you will

10:21.600 --> 10:25.920
come to me in here. Oh yeah good idea. Oh I sure I thought it would be.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.840
I wish you'd been in some of the others up in the snow hills of New Hampshire out in these

10:29.840 --> 10:36.800
lizards of well that would have had snow of Maine. And now one thing one of the names for

10:36.800 --> 10:41.440
I mean I'm at eight. Well I'm at the house. I don't have a copy of Maine.

10:41.440 --> 10:48.080
But anyway anyway there are two things I need the one other sensors and uh where I did nothing

10:48.080 --> 10:52.800
and you did nothing. Since the day you're there these are the study new things but I noticed that

10:53.440 --> 11:00.720
86,000 people wrote their names on the dollars for me and I think you got 1,324 up in Massachusetts

11:00.720 --> 11:06.320
where they just uh where they are. You've been all over Pennsylvania and I had never been in there for

11:06.320 --> 11:10.400
having to find Mary. Well you had a you went up there and dedicated a great six something

11:10.400 --> 11:15.440
and the day I saw that. I saw Mary. I think I've spoken there once too but neither I last spoken

11:15.440 --> 11:21.520
but once I think in Massachusetts they had a election up there where uh nobody can list their name

11:21.520 --> 11:28.320
but they have a place. So do you prefer to be president? I got uh just about 30,000 votes and

11:28.320 --> 11:35.280
later to score us all the time that you had 700. Yeah you you had you had your uh work of that all

11:35.280 --> 11:41.120
over the nation and I have not had any and uh you have uh once from prime areas where you didn't

11:41.120 --> 11:46.480
have any opposition. I don't know just how many delegates it's going to get you. With the preliminary

11:46.480 --> 11:52.720
over the debater stops sparring and got down to the record in a wrangle over who voted for what

11:52.720 --> 11:56.720
on federal labor legislation. Better working conditions and they're right of collective

11:56.720 --> 12:02.560
work. So however I know three of you voted against the politics bill and the task partly law.

12:02.560 --> 12:10.320
We had many others. So I want to uh I just looking over the record here wherever I found some

12:10.320 --> 12:15.200
labor thing it seemed like you were voting. Well, layman. Well there's this Conley Act and the

12:15.200 --> 12:20.960
task partly law and uh you named all of that many many others. Well anyway that's three of the

12:20.960 --> 12:25.520
century. Well I'll explain well you voted that you voted against the full employment act that was

12:25.520 --> 12:30.480
uh far as a benefit of labor. Oh no I voted for the full employment. Well it's the records right here

12:30.480 --> 12:35.520
that you voted against the full employment act I can find it. Oh look it up. I don't know what I'm

12:35.520 --> 12:41.920
going to do. Well if you admit it all right but I think we ought to get out of here because that

12:41.920 --> 12:49.600
says very important thing. Oh here it is nine. All right six twenty five forty three.

12:50.480 --> 12:55.440
Oh six nine twenty eight forty five voted against full employment act that passed seventy one

12:55.440 --> 13:00.240
set. And as soon as I'm here about that I did not vote against it. I voted against some of the

13:00.240 --> 13:05.040
amendments. Well there's some of my more liberal colleagues uh we're all right. And they were

13:05.040 --> 13:09.760
in the field. I didn't move against the I really Congress was quarterly I guess. But you didn't get

13:09.760 --> 13:13.840
it either congressional quarter now to make that fair you voted off some type of reason matter

13:13.840 --> 13:17.040
to you that well it's not I didn't. Well there's the thought of there's the taken from our

13:17.040 --> 13:22.240
congressional. Well that's a different thing. Now you're talking about the FEPC you did say on

13:22.240 --> 13:28.240
the floor of the Senate that it was regimentation that it was a doubtful constitutionality and that

13:28.240 --> 13:33.760
it would not work and that any effort to put it in law into operation would cause watch best

13:33.760 --> 13:39.360
difficulties which would be detrimental to the nation. But your quarter didn't associate

13:39.360 --> 13:48.400
press as fat Washington's under star of April 6th 1952 of saying if the Democratic Convention

13:49.120 --> 13:57.520
which nominates me adopts a platform including a compulsory FEPC plank a compulsory that's a

13:57.520 --> 14:04.960
compulsory GFEP plank I shall hold hardly support that platform and it's entirely. So unless you

14:04.960 --> 14:11.840
would greatly miss quartered there you did think it is unconstuse new and regimentation but you

14:11.840 --> 14:17.360
support it is put in the platform. You said a bit of dose that you will swallow if you have to.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.680
All right I'll say that I say that I'm a Democrat running on the Democratic Party I'm going to do

14:21.680 --> 14:25.920
my best to see that we've got the thing worked out but I'm not going to pick up my marbles and run

14:25.920 --> 14:30.400
out of the party if we don't. Well I've been a Democrat for some time myself and I can

14:30.400 --> 14:36.320
think that you're good at that legislation that over the past 20 years I've been the author of

14:36.320 --> 14:42.400
a good deal of it and I've supported their most of it but when you come to something it my mind is

14:42.400 --> 14:46.640
completeness socialistic they are all the line I've been living with the party before you would

14:46.640 --> 14:51.360
all know that's another one of these Indian endos you've been cast well out of it isn't here I

14:51.360 --> 14:55.760
never let here direct that so you would have one that was in you and those know I'm not going to

14:55.760 --> 15:00.640
leave the party I didn't leave the 1948 and put it in the platform I put it on the floor the

15:00.640 --> 15:05.360
Senate and kept kill it there and I led the fight against it and I'm going out it's when I'm

15:05.360 --> 15:09.120
nominated president I don't think they'll have it in the platform but they do I'm going to

15:09.120 --> 15:15.360
put it in the battle lines were sharply drawn Senator Keepover was sticking his head into a beehive

15:15.360 --> 15:20.720
of all line southern politicians including Florida's governor full of war and

15:21.520 --> 15:28.000
whole congressional delegation to senators here have ganged up on me to try to stop me down here

15:28.000 --> 15:33.840
for the administration tried to stop me and you have sure and Nebraska and now they've

15:34.560 --> 15:39.840
really got a gang up down here I've never seen anything like it in my life governor's it's

15:39.840 --> 15:44.960
through senators they all the congressman now would you just I don't know if they supported you

15:44.960 --> 15:51.360
and of course all of the you just about and of course all of our all of our people we made mad

15:51.360 --> 15:56.800
with the crime committing down here the recorders and gangsters they will joy then trying to

15:56.800 --> 16:02.080
give me the work to so I've got to write this off back into they must back and be well you might

16:02.080 --> 16:06.880
name them I don't know any of them you've apparently claimed willing to you'll work on the committee I

16:06.880 --> 16:13.120
don't know any uh right here's a gangsters here and of course you've been very effective in this

16:13.120 --> 16:19.040
four little s's attitude everybody's picking on him four little fellows they're all to get along

16:19.760 --> 16:26.800
but you've done very well by yourself yes Senator Keepover did all right in the Florida primary

16:26.800 --> 16:32.560
he made it close even though he lost and did you catch the significance of Senator Russell's

16:32.560 --> 16:40.000
statement concerning the FEPC I'd like to repeat what Senator Russell has just said about the FEPC

16:40.000 --> 16:45.920
plan and I quote when I'm nominated for president I do not think they will have it in the platform

16:45.920 --> 16:53.440
if they do I'm going to repudiate repudiate it will the democrats nominate the man and Chicago who

16:53.440 --> 16:58.560
has announced that he will repudiate the party platform and if Senator Keepover is nominated will

16:58.560 --> 17:04.720
he be repudiated by the south for the Tennessee senators answer to this vital question and others

17:04.720 --> 17:09.840
we'll take you in just a moment to keepover headquarters at the Raleigh Hotel in Washington

17:09.840 --> 17:15.920
but right now Bill Rogers has a word for the women well it's a little too early for the experts

17:15.920 --> 17:20.960
to make any political predictions everything's so topsy-turvy that reminds me everything's

17:20.960 --> 17:26.480
kind of topsy-turvy for the housewives too only they call it spring cleaning and that covers

17:26.480 --> 17:33.280
everything from clearing out the seller to a moth-proofing woolen's well ladies the seller is

17:33.280 --> 17:40.080
strictly up to you but I can offer you a few pointers on protection against moths first of all

17:40.080 --> 17:46.640
start outright with track gulf's effective safe moth killer that won't shrink or stain color fast

17:46.640 --> 17:52.320
woolen's yet protects them straight through the summer just follow the directions on the label

17:52.320 --> 17:57.200
and spray track on your winter willens before you store them and don't forget to spray track on

17:57.200 --> 18:03.600
your will and drapes and on the carpets especially where they aren't walked on tomorrow ask for

18:03.600 --> 18:09.840
track at your favorite store or at your good gulf dealers the usual price is 65 cents a quart

18:10.320 --> 18:15.440
don't let the low cost fool you you can't buy a finer moth killer than gulf track

18:15.520 --> 18:26.480
t-r-a-k good for clothes bad for moths and all let's go to keepover headquarters and Frank Bergholzer

18:29.120 --> 18:34.720
this is the national headquarters of senator estus kieffover a democratic senator and presidential

18:34.720 --> 18:40.640
candidate from chattanooga tenisee we're on the second floor of the rolly hotel in Washington dc

18:40.640 --> 18:44.960
on pence elvania avenue the street that runs from the capital to the white house and we're a

18:44.960 --> 18:50.160
little closer as a matter of fact to the white house than we are to the capital there 28 paid

19:02.000 --> 19:07.440
workers offices except strangely enough an office for senator kieffover himself whose office is in

19:07.440 --> 19:12.720
the senate office building among the most important of these offices is the press room chief

19:12.720 --> 19:17.760
publicist bill hard in his staff put out the campaign literature the press releases keep up

19:22.320 --> 19:27.680
primary out there in origan the press room is a very active place on nights like tonight it runs

19:27.680 --> 19:34.240
24 hours a day there are momentos of the campaign on the wall coonskin cap there's a portrait of

19:34.240 --> 19:40.480
senator kieffover and several other presidents there's a typical campaign poster and a typical

19:40.480 --> 19:45.360
newspaper ad that's when ran in a newspaper in tenisee but let's meet some of the people here in

19:45.360 --> 19:51.120
the press room here's Hank loose Washington time life correspondent this is nancy kieffover the

19:51.120 --> 19:58.000
senator's charming wife senator estes kieffover himself and frank bignotin the veteran life

19:58.000 --> 20:07.280
Washington correspondent well welcome to the kieffover headquarters we the people and i'm

20:07.280 --> 20:13.680
glad to have you here frank bignotin and hank loose of life magazine you see we have a very busy

20:13.680 --> 20:18.960
place here in our headquarters well senator kieffover nancy it's good to be here with you folks

20:18.960 --> 20:25.120
this evening it's such a rare occasion when we can catch you here i wonder how far do you think you

20:25.120 --> 20:30.800
traveled on this campaign center oh gee i haven't figured out yet frank but i imagine it's been more

20:30.800 --> 20:35.520
than a hundred thousand miles and you've been with us a whole lot of the time so you would know but

20:35.520 --> 20:41.280
we've been across the continent i think four times is that right mancy i think it must be about that

20:41.280 --> 20:48.240
least you have and it's been a very pleasant trip to frank i just came back just to have the

20:48.240 --> 20:53.200
opportunity of being with you and hank from san francisco this morning is a matter of fact i was

20:53.200 --> 20:57.840
afraid for a while that you wouldn't get in but uh... now senator i've got some questions if we

20:57.840 --> 21:03.920
want to ask you to clarify a few political issues and i'd like to ask you why it is senator kieffover

21:03.920 --> 21:08.800
that most of the democratic leaders are a lot of the democratic leaders and southern senators

21:09.840 --> 21:16.240
and some of the big city politicians are are lining up against you well frank i don't think

21:16.240 --> 21:20.800
that it's fair to say that all of them are lining up against me i do have a lot of political support

21:20.800 --> 21:26.000
from some of our good democratic political leaders and i'm happy to say that more and more of them

21:26.000 --> 21:30.960
are coming to my support particularly when they see the way the people are voting and the way

21:30.960 --> 21:36.800
the people seem to feel but uh... i don't know i think we're in for a time when the people are

21:36.800 --> 21:40.960
going to have more of a say so about what's going to happen in our political parties when

21:41.600 --> 21:46.640
the nominees of our parties will be selected more by the people than by the political leaders

21:47.600 --> 21:52.880
i support some of them know that i'm not going to be dictated to that i'm going to do the thing

21:52.880 --> 21:58.160
that i think is right if i'm elected president of the united states i wish you'd repeat that you

21:58.160 --> 22:03.680
said you would not be dictated to that's right well i i think we're always led to listen and to be

22:03.680 --> 22:09.680
counseled with but i think the first consideration must be the average man and woman of america

22:10.320 --> 22:14.960
and not just the political leaders do you think senator that there's any fear that you won't play

22:14.960 --> 22:23.200
the old style political game with some of the the political bosses well uh certainly i think there

22:23.200 --> 22:28.640
is a great deal of fear and there must be some basis for justification for the fear that i'm not

22:28.640 --> 22:33.840
going to play the old time political game but i'm going to make it very clear that i believe in

22:33.840 --> 22:39.360
organized in political organizations i think we have to have organizations that reflect the

22:39.360 --> 22:45.040
viewpoint and the will of the people and i think that we need to bring our the voice of our people

22:45.040 --> 22:50.640
to be felt more in our political organization so i'm not against political organizations as such

22:51.520 --> 22:56.000
i think they ought to be the instrumentality of the members of our political parties

22:56.720 --> 23:00.800
rather than having party organizations dictate to the people what they should do

23:01.280 --> 23:07.120
so i'm the keeper yeah hangis good see you again you put on a very strong race in the

23:07.680 --> 23:14.640
florida and yet you didn't quite uh win out and i wanted if you had any particular explanation for that

23:14.640 --> 23:19.440
well hangiably frank with you i did a great deal better than i ever anticipated i would

23:20.400 --> 23:24.400
when we went into florida it was predicted that we would lose three or four to one

23:25.600 --> 23:30.000
if uh florida is of course adjacent to the state of jorge where i might distinguish the

23:30.000 --> 23:35.760
opponent there who is a very capable and find man lives the brave men of jorge and live in florida

23:36.480 --> 23:41.440
and of course i had the combined political opposition of senator holland and

23:42.160 --> 23:46.720
senator smathers governor fuller war and all of the eight congressmen together with about

23:46.720 --> 23:52.240
nine tens of the chairman of the democratic committees in the state of florida then i ran on

23:52.240 --> 23:58.640
national issues and not sectional issues and i think expected i got 44% of the vote was a great

23:58.640 --> 24:04.480
thing for me it was much better than i ever expected to do and i think in the uh delegate contest that

24:04.480 --> 24:09.760
i will a several of the delegates who are pledged to me will be elected well senator do you know

24:09.760 --> 24:14.960
about how many delegates you have pledged to you and all right now all you mean all over the nation

24:15.680 --> 24:22.000
i think and the primary is that i've won about 115 delegates and i think that uh in convention

24:22.000 --> 24:27.280
states and in other places that i know of about two hundred and fifteen who have indicated that

24:27.280 --> 24:35.280
they're farmy as of now we're gaining every day though i'd like to get back to this matter of

24:35.280 --> 24:40.080
political support for just a minute frank you can get back to anything you want to buddy i have

24:40.960 --> 24:46.800
thank you i have a special message here that was sent to be read on this program i hope it's a

24:46.800 --> 24:51.600
good one for us that this year has never before the people want the candidate for president to be a

24:51.600 --> 24:58.160
man of their own choosing not one imposed upon them by political organizations senator key fover

24:58.160 --> 25:03.920
has demonstrated by his work as a congressman as a senator that is a true liberal in the sense

25:04.480 --> 25:09.680
of franklin d rosevalt tradition and that he will fight for honesty and government even when it

25:09.680 --> 25:16.080
means treading on toes of powerful persons in his own political part i think that's been demonstrated

25:16.720 --> 25:22.000
we and the democratic party want to win or this fall of all the candidates of our party now

25:22.000 --> 25:26.880
contending for the nomination senator key fover has the best chance of leading us to a victory in

25:26.880 --> 25:33.440
November that was a special message sent to you by mayor joseph s clerk of philadelphia and

25:33.440 --> 25:38.880
richard and ill worth the desperate attorney out there oh gee i do appreciate that message they

25:38.880 --> 25:45.520
are outstanding members of the democratic party that's the kind of new life and new attitude that we

25:45.520 --> 25:50.720
are having in our democratic party throughout the nation and jote larc and richard and ill worth

25:50.720 --> 25:55.760
i think or two of the and especially i'm convinced that it's true that they are a very outstanding

25:55.760 --> 26:00.800
american citizens and view of this wonderful message i've known both of them a long time and that's

26:01.680 --> 26:06.160
kind of new personality that we want to have in the democratic party and this message certainly

26:06.160 --> 26:11.840
comes as a very pleasant surprise to me and i have one other little surprise for you senator and that is

26:12.640 --> 26:18.240
i wondered if you'd had any election returns for moron no i haven't i spent about two days out

26:18.240 --> 26:23.680
there and i found that there was an effort to keep the vote down and also to build up some vote

26:23.680 --> 26:28.640
for governor stevensson so i had some worry about the outcome and i certainly would be glad to have

26:28.640 --> 26:34.000
some message about it right well i think i can give you a report right now we had to call just a

26:34.000 --> 26:40.800
few minutes ago from our correspondent and the important dean brawis and the state is is he the

26:41.840 --> 26:47.600
life correspondent that's right what he must be accurate to him he made spot checks over the entire state

26:47.600 --> 26:53.840
and the latest report was that you would win upward of 60 percent of the preferential vote

26:53.840 --> 26:59.120
oh that's what we own well delicate oh that's wonderful that's right see nicely i will i

26:59.120 --> 27:10.240
did out there great deal of this uh campaign success i think uh and goes to you and uh you've

27:10.240 --> 27:17.680
been made a lot of political speeches on behalf of your husband uh one of you can uh think of

27:17.680 --> 27:24.080
which feature you thought was your best well i did scarcely called them political speeches honestly

27:24.080 --> 27:29.840
i'm only just been tentiating occasionally when he wasn't able to be there and i i know none of them

27:29.840 --> 27:36.240
were best i think that isn't true but and i see almost shoots me every time he has to make a speech

27:36.240 --> 27:41.920
but sometimes our engagements we can't make them all so she goes and pinch hit his tense pits and

27:42.640 --> 27:46.480
really makes a wonderful speech too how do you know you've never heard well i heard about it though

27:48.080 --> 27:53.600
but what are the issues that you must like to talk about well the first main issue is my husband

27:53.600 --> 27:59.200
perhaps is something good about him gentlemen and this is people where i'm sir and direct we have a very

27:59.200 --> 28:05.120
special guest standing by in life magazine famous room 22 and this guest incident he has a message

28:05.120 --> 28:10.640
of special interest to you the senator keyfover so we take you now to room 22 the honorable Paul

28:10.640 --> 28:15.920
Douglas the distinguished senator from Illinois oh i do sure what i'm glad to be here i'm for

28:15.920 --> 28:22.000
the senator esti's keyfover for president and i'm for him to the finish there has been a stop

28:22.000 --> 28:28.400
keyfover movement in new hampshire in nebraska in florida and many other states the administration

28:28.400 --> 28:34.880
has had a hand in this campaign against my friend the politicians are against it but the people

28:34.880 --> 28:40.560
are for him i am for son of the keyfover because he would not let friendship and fix the trade

28:41.440 --> 28:46.720
i am for him because i know as certainly as i sit here that he would clear out the chisels and

28:46.720 --> 28:53.120
fixes who hang around the washington hotels and who hang onto the coattails of a great party he

28:53.120 --> 28:58.720
is the candidate of the people and he is for the people i am for him because i believe of all

28:58.720 --> 29:05.200
democrats he is the best man to be any republican including generalize in how i think he will win

29:05.200 --> 29:15.360
the nomination and that he will be elected
