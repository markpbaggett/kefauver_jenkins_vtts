00:00.000 --> 00:29.920
This is your senator, Estes Keifoper, who is one of the

00:29.920 --> 00:39.920
most living states around.

00:39.920 --> 00:48.400
Here he appears with the long term

00:48.400 --> 00:52.500
Senator Kefoffer has received one claim for his work in a crime investigations and to

00:52.500 --> 00:56.120
trust hearings and the present investigations into the drug industry.

00:56.120 --> 01:00.540
He is also vitally concerned with matters of great local interests such as TBA, the

01:00.540 --> 01:05.200
Reclamation Projects Farm Legislation, the high cost of living and numerous other problems

01:05.200 --> 01:07.360
that affect your everyday life.

01:07.360 --> 01:13.800
Senator Kefoffer has served in Congress since 1939 and has been in the Senate for 12 years.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.480
As your personal representative and friend, the Senator would like to meet you.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.120
So let's join the family in their Washington home.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.120
Senator Kefoffer.

01:23.120 --> 01:29.360
My friends, I certainly would like to be with you and personal on this occasion.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.920
But of course I have a lot of places to be in Tennessee.

01:32.920 --> 01:37.440
I do hope that during the summer I can have an opportunity of visiting with you personally

01:37.440 --> 01:41.840
and talking with as many of you as possible.

01:42.360 --> 01:49.520
On this occasion I do want you to meet again my family, my wife Nancy, whom all of you know.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.400
Nancy, you want to say something to the...

01:53.400 --> 01:56.120
Yes, I'm glad to be with you too.

01:56.120 --> 02:00.120
I actually want to get down to Tennessee as much as I can this summer and be with you in

02:00.120 --> 02:02.960
the next few months.

02:02.960 --> 02:09.040
And then our oldest daughter cannot be with us on this occasion because she's struggling

02:09.040 --> 02:12.680
hard to try to get by her freshman year at Vanderbilt.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.480
But Nancy, I think you got a picture of Linda.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.560
You didn't see that when it just came in the mail the other day.

02:18.560 --> 02:23.080
Well, I'm anxious to see it and I know that Linda will be with us this summer a great

02:23.080 --> 02:24.080
deal too.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.920
And here's my great big boy David.

02:26.920 --> 02:27.920
David Estes, Kefoffer.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.000
David, how are you getting along?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Fine.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.360
At school we just had a fair and I want to cat it.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.600
Oh, school at the fair.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.640
Well, I'll be able to get.

02:39.640 --> 02:40.640
That made two cats we had.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.280
Why'd you do that little bit of kitten?

02:42.280 --> 02:43.800
Well, I had to give it away.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.160
We already had two dogs in one cat.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.400
You mean you drew a number in one little kitten?

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
Yes.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.520
I used a cute little kitten I saw him but I saw to agree with you that one around the

02:55.520 --> 02:59.520
house may be enough.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.040
And Diane, this is our daughter Diane.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.520
She's not 12 years old and she goes to school.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.920
What are you going to do this summer Diane?

03:07.440 --> 03:13.360
Well, I'm planning to go down to Tennessee after camp and help my sister around the house.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.760
Want to help Linda run our little house on lookout mountain?

03:16.760 --> 03:20.000
Well, I hope that we just got our house finished this last summer.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.480
It's a, we hope that as many of you as possible may come and visit us sometime when we're

03:25.480 --> 03:26.480
there.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.720
I believe you have a big job of feeding the dogs in the cat most of the time, don't you?

03:32.720 --> 03:33.720
Diane.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.720
Supposed to.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
Supposed to.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.320
Well, Gail, how are you getting along, sweetie?

03:39.320 --> 03:42.600
Gail is nine years old.

03:42.600 --> 03:47.120
And are you going to come down and travel around with us sometime this summer?

03:47.120 --> 03:49.320
Yeah, well, I got a camp first.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.320
Uh-huh.

03:50.320 --> 03:55.240
And then I remember four years ago you went several places with Nancy and me when we were

03:55.240 --> 03:58.920
in our campaign and what you do in there when you went around.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.520
That guy on your buttons?

04:01.520 --> 04:03.160
Put buttons on people.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.920
I remember you put a button on, you tried to give a fellow a button, he wouldn't take

04:06.920 --> 04:08.160
one and what you do then.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.120
But I put it on the back of his cat.

04:11.120 --> 04:16.520
Well, that's a, you were so little and you had to reach up and put it on the back of his

04:16.520 --> 04:20.760
coat, but I guess this time you can do it a whole lot better.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.760
Well, David, what are you going to do when you got through?

04:24.760 --> 04:28.960
First, where are you going to go to college if you pass your grades and everything?

04:28.960 --> 04:35.120
Well, I'd like to go to the University of Tennessee because I believe that that has one

04:35.120 --> 04:38.120
of the best education for agriculture.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.400
You mean you're going to be a farmer?

04:40.400 --> 04:42.320
You're going to be a farmer?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.560
Down at Madisonville maybe one of these days.

04:44.560 --> 04:49.080
Why don't you be a good farmer because you like to, you're always willing to mow the

04:49.080 --> 04:52.960
yard which I don't do very often.

04:52.960 --> 04:59.960
When I die on New York, like your mother, you're somewhat of an artist, what is it that you

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
like to draw?

05:00.960 --> 05:05.760
Well, I like to paint horses and what's about them.

05:05.760 --> 05:11.080
Well, I gave, we've been talking a whole lot about how dying paints horses and then we

05:11.080 --> 05:16.720
did mention that you went down to the studio with Mummy once in a while and we might have

05:16.720 --> 05:19.200
proud of something happened about your paintings over there.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
What was that?

05:20.840 --> 05:24.200
Well, I saw two of my paintings and I got $2.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.200
Oh, you did?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.200
Oh, you did?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.200
That was wonderful.

05:27.200 --> 05:31.200
I don't think a little girl ever has been so excited when somebody paid her $10 for a painting.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
That's $10 for a two-painting.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.200
$10 for two-painting?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.200
Yeah, that's right.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
$5 feet.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
She loves to paint.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.200
Like, she owes a model, isn't she?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
You know.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
You just like to paint?

05:41.200 --> 05:44.200
No, she just paints like that.

05:45.200 --> 05:52.560
Well, we have always have two good dogs and then Dan, you want to tell us about, tell

05:52.560 --> 05:56.200
our friends about our present dogs?

05:56.200 --> 06:01.200
Well, one's a Cocker Spaniel and his name's Jojo.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.200
We've had Jojo a long time.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.200
He's a pretty dog.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.200
Then what's the new one?

06:06.200 --> 06:10.200
It's an Irish setter and her name's Amber.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.200
Well, they're certain they're their fine dogs.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.200
I think maybe they were in the picture here a little while ago.

06:16.200 --> 06:22.200
I know that every morning, when the mailman comes, you're a great big stack of mail for you.

06:22.200 --> 06:29.200
Down in the office, we got lots of mail from the people in Tennessee.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.200
You got a lot of mail.

06:30.200 --> 06:35.200
What kind of mail do you get and how do you answer it?

06:35.200 --> 06:40.200
Well, I get a lot of mail from the women in ten throughout the state.

06:40.200 --> 06:45.200
They're problems just about the same as ours are here.

06:45.200 --> 06:56.200
I keep up quite a correspondence, as you know, and discuss our mutual problems of our children

06:56.200 --> 06:58.200
and our food and everything else.

06:58.200 --> 07:04.200
I know a lot of them write you about education and about how cost of living or about, in fact,

07:04.200 --> 07:07.200
they might be going to come to Washington.

07:07.200 --> 07:14.200
Of course, you know we have many visitors from the state, and we are constantly seeing people from Tennessee.

07:14.200 --> 07:21.200
Just last week, we had over 20 women at the Democratic Convention here.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.200
So that's a grand way to keep in touch with what's going on at home.

07:24.200 --> 07:29.200
I think the good people we are visiting, whether people, particularly the women,

07:29.200 --> 07:34.200
might be interested in a typical day of yours in Washington, Nancy,

07:34.200 --> 07:39.200
what you do and what you have to do and what your activities are.

07:39.200 --> 07:45.200
Well, of course, once a week, the Senate late is meat, and that's a busy and amusing day.

07:45.200 --> 07:56.200
We get into uniform and go down to one of the rooms in the Senate and roll bandages and prepare squares and everything for the Red Cross.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.200
And do a lot of talking to us.

07:58.200 --> 08:03.200
We do a lot of gossiping and exchange news about our various sections of the country,

08:03.200 --> 08:07.200
and we take our lunch in a little paper bag and we get cup of coffee and it's very informal.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.200
David, you're going to go out and campaign somewhere this summer?

08:10.200 --> 08:12.200
Yes, I hope to.

08:12.200 --> 08:18.200
And, uh, well, you know a lot of boys in Tennessee because you've been over to High Lake County.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.200
I think you're one of the oldest campers over there, aren't you?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.200
Yes, sir.

08:23.200 --> 08:31.200
And, uh, what are you and Linda going to do when you got down to the house in Tennessee, Diane?

08:31.200 --> 08:34.200
Well, I guess mostly clean it up.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.200
And more of the grass?

08:36.200 --> 08:37.200
Yes.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.200
Well, Linda's big enough to mold the grass, isn't she?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.200
Well, uh...

08:43.200 --> 08:45.200
We're plodding to do.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.200
I know that Nancy has about the same problem that most all...

08:51.200 --> 08:57.200
Uh, mothers doing connection with education, I have to be aware of a great deal, down at the office.

08:57.200 --> 09:08.200
And, um, Nancy has the job of taking the kids around to the girl scouts and to the brownies and to the boy scouts.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.200
It's the arithmetic homework.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.200
I wish you'd stay home more than that to help with that.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.200
When I'm helping Gayle with her arithmetic, see?

09:17.200 --> 09:21.200
David and Diane are a jump ahead, so I come out pretty easily.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.200
And then when I have to help David, sometimes over my head.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.200
I remember you sent me a book on a 4-H club.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.200
Can I have been reading it?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.200
Yeah, well, um...

09:34.200 --> 09:41.200
I'm glad David is, wants to be a farmer because, um, we need more farmers, but they've been having many hard times.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.200
You know, David, but you'll be a good one, won't you?

09:44.200 --> 09:48.200
I don't know if I'll be able to actually be one, but he's never wanted to be anything else.

09:48.200 --> 09:53.200
Well, I always wanted to be a lawyer. I didn't know I'd ever be a politician when I...

09:53.200 --> 09:55.200
You never can tell.

09:55.200 --> 10:05.200
Well, ladies and gentlemen, certainly has been good to visit with you on this occasion, and I wish that our daughter Linda could...

10:05.200 --> 10:09.200
be with us as well as David and Diane and Gayle, and...

10:09.200 --> 10:14.200
but we'll all be around this summer and try to see as many of you as possible.

10:16.200 --> 10:25.200
Now that you have had a visit with my family, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing some of the more pressing domestic issues, facing our state and our nation,

10:25.200 --> 10:28.200
and letting you know where I stand on them.

10:28.200 --> 10:33.200
Over the long haul, one of the most serious unsolved problems is high prices.

10:34.200 --> 10:40.200
We have been in an inflationary spiral for years, and prices have been going up almost constantly.

10:40.200 --> 10:46.200
If there is one group which does not need to be reminded of this fact, it is the Housewives.

10:46.200 --> 10:51.200
It is no consolation to them to be told that inflation has been slowed down.

10:51.200 --> 10:58.200
Prices still inch up almost every month, and the net result over the years is indeed shocking.

10:58.200 --> 11:05.200
The causes of our inflationary spiral are very complex, and I won't try to oversimplify the problem.

11:05.200 --> 11:10.200
But one of the major causes is what the economist called administered prices.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.200
We layman normally think of them as collusive prices.

11:13.200 --> 11:19.200
What it amounts to is that a particular industry may be monopolized by a few huge companies,

11:19.200 --> 11:25.200
which then rigged the prices to eliminate competition and to assure extra high profits.

11:25.200 --> 11:32.200
Such practices could not be more contrary to the basic concepts underlying our free enterprise system.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.200
I have held a number of hearings on monopolies in some of our industries,

11:36.200 --> 11:39.200
where competition has been almost completely eliminated.

11:39.200 --> 11:44.200
The steel industry and the electrical industry are excellent examples.

11:44.200 --> 11:51.200
More recently we held a long series of hearings to show why the cost of drugs to the drug is so excessive,

11:51.200 --> 11:56.200
and why the profits in the drug manufacturing industry are equally excessive.

11:56.200 --> 12:07.200
And I shall continue to press for legislation which will restore competition to those many industries which are now almost completely monopolized by a few huge firms.

12:07.200 --> 12:14.200
And I think that fiscal irresponsibility is also something against which we must always be on guard,

12:14.200 --> 12:17.200
because it has something to do with inflation too.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.200
The Congress can and does make substantial savings.

12:20.200 --> 12:25.200
We made cuts in the proposed budget at places where we felt that it could be done,

12:25.200 --> 12:30.200
commensurate with the national security and the general welfare of the country.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.200
For many years I was a member of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate,

12:34.200 --> 12:44.200
and we were able to eliminate to make many savings by eliminating many of the overlapping activities in our military reorganization bill.

12:44.200 --> 12:49.200
Activities and waste which has been so common in the Pentagon.

12:49.200 --> 12:54.200
Another problem which is crucial and complex is the farm situation.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.200
This problem gets worse and worse each year.

12:57.200 --> 13:05.200
One of the favorite indoor sports throughout the country these days seems to be a game called Beat Ezra Tath Benson,

13:05.200 --> 13:09.200
and he seems to be fair game for Democrats and Republicans alike.

13:10.200 --> 13:15.200
Well I think Mr. Benson has made a bad mess out of the farm situation,

13:15.200 --> 13:18.200
but whipping him will not solve the problems.

13:18.200 --> 13:23.200
There are many people who do not really understand how bad things are with the average farmer.

13:23.200 --> 13:33.200
Very few non-farmers, for example, know that since 1951, the price of corn per bushel has dropped from 166 to 105 per bushel.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.200
And this is a 37% decrease.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.200
All that cotton seed is down 43%.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.200
All that beef cattle are down 22%.

13:42.200 --> 13:48.200
All that millions of people have been leaving the farms and going into the already crowded cities.

13:48.200 --> 13:57.200
I could go on and on, but more figures would only underline the conclusion that the farmers are really in very bad straits.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.200
And this is particularly true of the small family farmer.

14:01.200 --> 14:07.200
Well I've spent a good part of my 22 years in Congress fighting for the survival of the small farmer.

14:07.200 --> 14:18.200
And we must find ways to protect the income of the small family-sized farmer and also find a way to assure that all farmers get their fair share of the farm dollar.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.200
At the same time we must protect the taxpayer and the consumer.

14:22.200 --> 14:28.200
I do not pretend that this will be easy, but I do contend that it can be done.

14:29.200 --> 14:34.200
One thing that I have urged is the establishment of a Department of Consumers and the Federal Government.

14:34.200 --> 14:42.200
We have Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and of Labor, but we have no Department to look after the interest of the consumers.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.200
And every American is a consumer.

14:45.200 --> 14:50.200
And a Department to look after our interest as consumers is long overdue.

14:50.200 --> 14:55.200
In my estimation, the third most serious domestic problem in the country today,

14:56.200 --> 15:01.200
is that of providing first-rate public schools to all of our children.

15:01.200 --> 15:08.200
Despite a massive effort on the part of states and local communities in building schools since World War II,

15:08.200 --> 15:13.200
there is still a shortage of 140,000 classrooms throughout the country.

15:13.200 --> 15:18.200
There is also a shortage of 195,000 teachers.

15:18.200 --> 15:23.200
Everyone knows the old adage about a picture being worth a thousand words.

15:23.200 --> 15:32.200
Here is a recent cartoon by the famous Bill Maudlin, which appeared in the Harold Rebun and which proves this point very neatly.

15:32.200 --> 15:38.200
The cartoon says, I'm not playing hooky, I just fell out.

15:38.200 --> 15:44.200
These shortages do not result from any lack of foresight or initiative on the part of local authorities.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.200
They are dear rather to the fact that our population is expanding at an extremely high rate,

15:50.200 --> 15:55.200
and the fact that our local tax resources are stretched almost to the breaking point.

15:55.200 --> 16:00.200
It is for this reason that I believe that federal aid for education is vital.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.200
This aid can be given without any danger of federal control.

16:04.200 --> 16:08.200
The legislation has specific prohibitions on this point,

16:08.200 --> 16:15.200
and it can be given in such a way that states decide how much of the aid is to be spent for school construction

16:15.200 --> 16:19.200
and how much for supplementing teacher salaries.

16:19.200 --> 16:26.200
Federal aid would be a particular assistance to states like Tennessee, whose average income is below the national average.

16:26.200 --> 16:33.200
For every dollar paid in federal taxes paid by Tennesseans, we would get back more than $2 in federal aid,

16:33.200 --> 16:36.200
and these are good national programs too.

16:36.200 --> 16:42.200
I have here a chart which was recently published by the Tennessee Municipal Association.

16:42.200 --> 16:50.200
It says, federal grants in aid return $2.22 to Tennessee for every $1 in federal taxes.

16:50.200 --> 16:55.200
It is a tremendous bargain for state with only two-thirds US average.

16:55.200 --> 17:00.200
Well, let's take for example here, here is water pollution control.

17:00.200 --> 17:09.200
The total spent in Tennessee is $4.52 million, and Tennesseans paid for this program in taxes $1.9 million.

17:09.200 --> 17:17.200
And let's take a hospital construction, which means so much to especially smaller cities of Tennessee.

17:17.200 --> 17:27.200
The total received in Tennessee was $47.2 million, and Tennesseans for this program paid $16.4 million.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.200
And then others are on down the line as you will see.

17:31.200 --> 17:37.200
As I said before, the average is more than $2 in aid for every dollar in taxes.

17:37.200 --> 17:43.200
This is obviously a great bargain for Tennessee, but it's also beneficial to the rest of the country.

17:43.200 --> 17:49.200
As the economic health of the country depends on the economic health of all of its sections.

17:49.200 --> 17:55.200
Well, I've heard a number of people argue that federal aid to education is vital,

17:55.200 --> 18:04.200
if we were to keep up with the Russians. Well, this is true, but I think that all American children are entitled to a first-rate education,

18:04.200 --> 18:08.200
even if a serious external threat did not exist.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.200
We are about far the richest nation in the world.

18:11.200 --> 18:18.200
We can certainly afford not only a decent education for our children, but an excellent education.

18:18.200 --> 18:24.200
Well, this chart, when you saw it a minute ago, you would notice that there is no mention of several very important programs.

18:24.200 --> 18:30.200
One of these is federal aid to depressed areas of which there are many in Tennessee.

18:30.200 --> 18:38.200
The Congress passed a bill to assess these blighted areas in their redevelopment, but this was unfortunately vetoed.

18:38.200 --> 18:47.200
And you also saw a few minutes ago no mention of a program for medical or hospital care for our agent, our senior citizens.

18:47.200 --> 18:56.200
We all know that this is a much needed program, since a great proportion of our older people have greatly increased medical and hospital expenses,

18:56.200 --> 18:59.200
when they are least able to pay for them.

18:59.200 --> 19:08.200
It is my hope and expectation that some adequate program that will give them some substantial relief may be enacted in the very near future.

19:09.200 --> 19:14.200
There are also a number of going concerns, which are particularly interests to Tennessee,

19:14.200 --> 19:18.200
and which are the subject of constant sniping in Washington.

19:18.200 --> 19:29.200
A good example is the Tennessee Valley Authority, which is done more to revitalize the economy of Tennessee that anything else in the last hundred years, well in our history for that matter.

19:29.200 --> 19:36.200
There are constant attempts by the public power interest, either to chop it apart, or at least to tie its hands.

19:36.200 --> 19:42.200
There are others who would destroy or limit the R.E.A. program, which is so vital to rural Tennessee.

19:42.200 --> 19:48.200
I am quite certain that all of the attempts to destroy these worthwhile projects will ultimately fail.

19:48.200 --> 20:02.200
But in a literal sense, there must be a constant vigilance in both the houses of Congress and among our people who are affected if they are to remain vital and effective for our continued use.

20:03.200 --> 20:12.200
Another subject, which has occupied my time and attention to a great extent, has been the national difficulty and problem of juvenile delinquency.

20:12.200 --> 20:20.200
As chairman of the Senate subcommittee dealing with this problem, we held hearings in various parts of the country.

20:20.200 --> 20:31.200
It was our object to enlist the cooperation of all government agencies, local, state, and federal, and to coordinate their efforts with those of the parents, schools, and the churches.

20:31.200 --> 20:40.200
In a sense, we were engaged in an educational process. But in another sense, we were engaged in a very important legislative process.

20:40.200 --> 20:49.200
We were able to get new laws enacted to tighten up the traffic and the control of narcotics.

20:49.200 --> 20:58.200
We are now working on legislation to strengthen the hands of the post office department and the Department of Justice in their battle against smut and obscenity.

20:59.200 --> 21:05.200
The Senate passed a bill for aid to the states and the training of personnel to combat juvenile delinquency.

21:05.200 --> 21:14.200
We also want to establish forestry camps, which we believe are superior to juvenile homes for many types of delinquents.

21:14.200 --> 21:23.200
Well, as important as these domestic problems may be, I am sure that all of you are aware of the equal seriousness of our international situation.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.200
A permanent peace is something which we are yet to achieve.

21:27.200 --> 21:32.200
Meanwhile, we must keep our country both militarily and economically strong.

21:32.200 --> 21:44.200
One of our greatest sources of strength is the unity of the Atlantic community, especially the cooperation which has been achieved within the NATO and the NATO nations.

21:45.200 --> 21:53.200
As long as the NATO countries stand together, war is unlikely because the communists know that we would win any war that they started.

21:53.200 --> 22:01.200
I have attended many meetings of the NATO parliamentarians who are the legislators from all of the NATO countries.

22:01.200 --> 22:13.200
I have worked for the establishment of the Atlantic Congress, which was held last June, from which we hope to get a more closely knit economic community in this part in this area of the world.

22:14.200 --> 22:21.200
Such a community could more fully share the cost of foreign aid, which we have supported almost alone for many years now.

22:21.200 --> 22:27.200
There are a number of other subjects which I should like to discuss with you, but I have already presumed upon your patience.

22:27.200 --> 22:37.200
Again, let me say how sorry I am not to be with you in person on this occasion, and let me thank you very much for letting me visit with you on this film.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.200
Thank you.
