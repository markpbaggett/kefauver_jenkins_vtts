00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
With the big battles of the 1956 Democratic Convention fought and won all that remains

00:20.000 --> 00:24.240
for the final evening session of the Chicago meeting is the formal acceptance features

00:24.240 --> 00:25.240
of the candidates.

00:25.240 --> 00:40.560
Members of the Convention, it is a high privilege that I have in preventing to use the next

00:40.560 --> 00:43.660
speaker.

00:43.660 --> 00:53.820
He has demonstrated time and time again that he is a boat-gatherer.

00:53.820 --> 01:06.500
Whether in Tennessee or throughout the length of bread of the United States.

01:06.500 --> 01:21.300
He is a wonderful member of a wonderful and winning team.

01:21.300 --> 01:30.340
These two men in my opinion will go forth and wager about it.

01:30.340 --> 01:43.140
Every Democrat in America will be proud of and they will wage a winning battle.

01:43.140 --> 01:55.340
It is my privilege and I deem it an honor to present your choice for the Democratic nomination

01:55.340 --> 02:02.340
of the Vice President of the United States.

03:55.340 --> 04:14.900
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Mr. Speaker Rayburn for introducing me in such generous

04:14.900 --> 04:19.340
terms to you tonight.

04:19.340 --> 04:28.540
There is no man in the United States under whom more people in public life have studied

04:28.540 --> 04:42.700
and been taught and have studied under the distinguished speaker of the House of Representatives,

04:42.700 --> 04:51.380
Mr. Sam Rayburn.

04:51.380 --> 04:54.860
And he never forgets this.

04:54.860 --> 05:00.220
He is always generous in his reference to us.

05:00.220 --> 05:09.380
Friends I am profoundly grateful to you delegates to this convention for the honor that you

05:09.380 --> 05:12.220
have paid me.

05:12.220 --> 05:16.460
I accept this honor with much humility.

05:16.460 --> 05:22.140
I accept the responsibility which it entails.

05:22.140 --> 05:38.660
I want to promise you that I will work and fight for victory as hard as I possibly can.

05:38.660 --> 05:46.940
And then many of my efforts, I hope to have my special secret weapon along with me, whom

05:46.940 --> 05:57.500
you saw here with me just a few minutes ago.

05:57.500 --> 06:01.940
This I think has been a magnificent convention.

06:01.940 --> 06:10.180
It marks the first time in contemporary American history in which a great political party

06:10.180 --> 06:22.940
shows its vice presidential candidate in a free and open convention.

06:22.940 --> 06:27.380
This adds greatly to my pride that I was successful.

06:27.380 --> 06:36.620
There certainly weren't any smoke-filled room decisions made here this afternoon.

06:36.620 --> 06:45.740
And I want to say friends that if these distinguished men, Avril Harman and the others who put

06:45.740 --> 07:02.620
on such magnificent campaigns yesterday for the presidency, John Kennedy and my other

07:02.620 --> 07:18.540
good friends who made noble and remarkable and clean hard campaigns for the vice presidential

07:18.540 --> 07:21.780
nomination this afternoon.

07:21.780 --> 07:27.700
If they will just work in the months to come as hard as they have worked in this convention,

07:27.700 --> 07:35.180
then we sure are going to succeed.

07:35.180 --> 07:41.180
And I'm sure that they and all of the fine young men and women that we have in our Democratic

07:41.180 --> 07:49.420
Party and we are fortunate in having so many that they are going to do just that.

07:49.420 --> 07:54.980
I applaud any extension of the democratic process.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.300
And this was certainly one.

07:57.300 --> 08:01.180
I hope that it will set a precedent for the future.

08:01.180 --> 08:07.100
It will be very interesting to see whether this precedent is going to be followed in San Francisco

08:07.100 --> 08:17.460
next week.

08:17.460 --> 08:27.260
And never had been such an outstanding men as I had to contend against this afternoon.

08:27.260 --> 08:34.340
And as Governor Stevenson had to contend against yesterday, I had a number of calls after the

08:34.340 --> 08:39.140
convention this afternoon from many of my friends and supporters.

08:39.140 --> 08:47.700
So many of them say that while they were joyous over the outcome, that their joy was

08:47.700 --> 08:53.260
somewhat saddened by the fact that they could not be for all of the candidates for the

08:53.260 --> 09:03.060
vice presidential nomination here this afternoon.

09:03.060 --> 09:10.340
As Edley Stevenson, our candidate for president, has already made unique contributions both

09:10.340 --> 09:14.900
to the philosophy and to the tone of politics.

09:14.900 --> 09:20.380
His unusual gift of intellect and width are known to all.

09:20.380 --> 09:29.380
Perhaps on no better than most, his capacity as an effective and untiring fighter.

09:29.380 --> 09:39.620
I found out the hard way.

09:39.620 --> 09:46.260
And I know that he is going to lead us in a vigorous hard-hitting campaign that's going

09:46.260 --> 09:48.660
to be successful.

09:48.660 --> 09:56.340
And believe me, when I say that, I ought to know because I found out myself.

09:56.340 --> 10:02.580
I know that in the forthcoming campaign, Mr. Stevenson, will bring to the American people

10:02.580 --> 10:08.580
fresh understanding of our grave problems at home and abroad.

10:08.580 --> 10:19.820
I salute him as our leader.

10:19.820 --> 10:27.420
I wish to pay tribute also to you, President Summon, for your courage and foresight in a

10:27.420 --> 10:33.020
difficult world has given us pride and satisfaction today.

10:33.020 --> 10:43.740
And it has given us inspiration for tomorrow.

10:43.740 --> 10:48.780
I'm sure that all of you good Democrats and Democrats everywhere who may be looking

10:48.780 --> 10:57.420
at us today and tonight understand that we face a heavy task in the months to come.

10:57.420 --> 11:04.460
Because of your support, it will be a task confidently undertaken.

11:04.460 --> 11:11.260
The Republican Party has tried to imprint itself in the past four years, yet the failures

11:11.260 --> 11:18.100
of the Republicans to solve the problems of our people at home and the drift and indecision

11:18.180 --> 11:25.580
which has marked its actions abroad make it imperative ever so imperative that we have

11:25.580 --> 11:30.900
a change of leadership and that we have a new direction.

11:30.900 --> 11:44.500
Victory is our goal and with the help of all Democrats united and purposeful as I'm

11:44.500 --> 11:51.500
sure they will be and under the leadership of Adley Stevenson we're going to achieve

11:51.500 --> 11:59.060
that goal.

11:59.060 --> 12:04.220
But we have a wider obligation than the winning of the presidency.

12:04.220 --> 12:09.180
We have a great duty to win a Democratic Congress.

12:09.180 --> 12:19.180
We have a duty to win state houses and court houses as well.

12:19.180 --> 12:25.820
I hope and believe that in the execution of our responsibilities in this campaign we will

12:25.820 --> 12:33.020
carry the Democratic Party, the whole Democratic Party to new heights of influence and to

12:33.020 --> 12:36.380
power in this nation.

12:36.380 --> 12:43.420
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud of the record of our Democratic Party and we will point

12:43.420 --> 12:45.940
out that record.

12:45.940 --> 12:49.900
But we're not going to run on our record alone.

12:49.900 --> 12:56.700
As long as here in the United States we have people in adequate clothing and homes and

12:56.700 --> 12:58.420
food.

12:58.420 --> 13:05.620
As long as we have the working man unfairly treated by Republican inspired laws, as long

13:05.700 --> 13:13.420
as we are not properly developing our natural resources, as long as the farmer is suffering

13:13.420 --> 13:23.020
because of broken promises of this administration, as long as we have intolerance and indiscrimination,

13:23.020 --> 13:31.060
and as long as we have a world in which we have only on uneasy peace with millions of people

13:31.060 --> 13:39.580
underfed and seeking freedom, then we have challenges which we must solve for ragesely

13:39.580 --> 13:43.860
and which we must tell the American people about.

13:43.860 --> 13:51.260
We are going to again give our people and the people of the free world new faith and new

13:51.260 --> 13:58.900
hope and on that basis we are going to win this election.

13:58.900 --> 14:10.420
I do not think that tonight is the time for me to talk about the duties of the Vice

14:10.420 --> 14:17.580
Presidency and what role he should play, but I will take just a few seconds to say what

14:17.580 --> 14:20.540
his role should not be.

14:20.540 --> 14:25.420
The chief function of the Vice President should not be that of a political sharpshooter for

14:25.420 --> 14:35.060
his party.

14:35.060 --> 14:39.980
It should not be that of providing this smear under the protection of the President's

14:39.980 --> 14:46.820
smile.

14:46.820 --> 14:54.940
We must not only be a party of criticism, we want to be one of inspiration.

14:54.940 --> 15:05.980
What we stand for in this campaign is far more important than what we stand against.

15:05.980 --> 15:12.260
And as a party of hope and inspiration, we must fire the imagination of young people

15:12.260 --> 15:18.900
and the women who support we can and we must retain.

15:18.900 --> 15:24.540
As your Vice Presidential candidate, I promise you, friends, that I will never demean

15:24.540 --> 15:35.020
that high office to produce fellow Americans.

15:35.020 --> 15:44.380
I will never use it to sow the seeds of division and of distrust.

15:44.380 --> 15:51.060
In our party and in this campaign, we are not going to have one low road and one high

15:52.060 --> 15:53.060
road.

15:53.060 --> 16:00.780
In this party and in this campaign, we are going to have two high roads, both of them high

16:00.780 --> 16:05.620
roads to victory.

16:05.620 --> 16:20.620
Tomorrow morning, Nancy and I will be flying down to Tennessee to a farm to see our children

16:20.620 --> 16:24.740
and they got a little rest for the campaign ahead.

16:24.740 --> 16:32.700
Incidentally, we called up our four children late this afternoon, got them on the telephone.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.660
They said that they had been having a caucus that they had seen this convention on the

16:36.660 --> 16:42.100
television and they thought they might as well have a caucus too.

16:42.100 --> 16:47.220
And they, I want to tell you what, they had decided in the caucus that they had.

16:47.220 --> 16:54.220
Like in 1952, after I won my last political campaign, they said that as a celebration, we

16:55.580 --> 16:58.620
had to buy a new station wagon.

16:58.620 --> 17:03.100
So this time in their caucus, they said they had decided we had to take the station wagon

17:03.100 --> 17:13.900
in and get Nancy a new convertible.

17:13.900 --> 17:19.060
That's Mrs. Keith Alver with the Stevenson family.

17:19.060 --> 17:22.820
I want to thank you for your confidence.

17:22.820 --> 17:32.300
With the grace of God, with your help, we will work and fight through to a glorious,

17:33.060 --> 17:35.540
democratic victory this fall.

17:35.540 --> 17:36.540
Thank you.
