WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.560
Voluntarily coming from his diplomatic post in Mexico, New York's former mayoral

00:16.560 --> 00:20.840
Dwyer is another witness in these hearings to discover the extent of gangster influence

00:20.840 --> 00:22.600
in politics.

00:22.600 --> 00:27.080
The committee wants some facts about an alleged murderer who escaped prosecution, although

00:27.080 --> 00:31.720
there was a purpy case for indictment against him.

00:31.720 --> 00:41.460
It's very evident that in your opinion, Anastasia was one of the highest in command of this

00:41.460 --> 00:42.660
notorious outfit.

00:42.660 --> 00:49.480
He was entrusted with all the murders, official murders of theirs, committed by the Brooklyn

00:49.480 --> 00:52.200
group, no matter where they were committed.

00:52.200 --> 00:58.720
And over what period of time were you in office after his indictment was returned?

00:58.720 --> 00:59.720
It was never in doubt.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.920
I mean, after the action was taken, there the investigation was made.

01:02.920 --> 01:09.080
I was two and a half years in office, but it could have possibly been many months less

01:09.080 --> 01:11.360
than that, but we're thoroughly understood.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.360
The picture.

01:13.360 --> 01:18.120
Well, the question that possibly might occur to the minds of some is whether or not there

01:18.120 --> 01:26.220
is any explanation for the fact that proceedings were not pursued prior to your leaving the

01:26.220 --> 01:29.440
office with the knowledge that you had against him.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.440
Yes.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.080
There's a very good explanation of that.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.080
There's a factual explanation.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.720
The facts speak for themselves.

01:37.720 --> 01:45.560
That in this state you cannot convict any person of a crime on the unsupported testimony

01:45.560 --> 01:48.880
of a co-conspirator.

01:48.880 --> 01:56.200
Gentlemen, I like you to remember that because that's a principle of law in this state that

01:56.200 --> 01:59.320
gives us a lot of trouble.

01:59.320 --> 02:07.480
That's a principle of law in this state that let Anna Stachier get away.

02:07.480 --> 02:15.280
Believe me, if we could have convicted any one of these people on the unsupported testimony

02:15.280 --> 02:22.040
of co-conspirators, would have been able to send every one of them.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.840
Certainly indict them.

02:23.840 --> 02:29.760
Of course, I wouldn't suggest that an indictment what the...

02:29.760 --> 02:31.760
Yes, sir.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.760
I'm not going Mr. Mayor to heaven, sir.

02:34.760 --> 02:40.840
The story to the Anna Stachier case is that not a fact that you made the comment at about

02:40.840 --> 02:45.720
that time that the police had a perfect case murder in the first degree against Mr.

02:45.720 --> 02:46.720
Anna Stachier.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.720
For indictment.

02:47.720 --> 02:48.720
For indictment?

02:48.720 --> 02:49.720
Yes, sir.

02:49.720 --> 02:54.160
Well, why would you say that if you knew you didn't have the evidence to give her two witnesses?

02:54.160 --> 02:56.960
I've come to that later, but I'll answer the question now.

02:56.960 --> 02:57.960
I wish you would.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.440
I had the witnesses, but I didn't have Anna Stachier.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.440
And what is the other witness, Reles?

03:03.440 --> 03:04.440
Reles?

03:04.440 --> 03:06.200
Oh, I had more than Reles.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.080
What was Reles an important witness?

03:08.080 --> 03:12.800
Reles was the one witness who was not involved in the crime.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.200
But he didn't know about it in your judgment.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.200
And that's...

03:17.200 --> 03:18.800
I depended on Reles at the independent...

03:18.800 --> 03:20.720
And that's why he was locked up in the hotel.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.960
The hotel, was that it?

03:21.960 --> 03:25.360
Not for that one case alone, but that is why he was in the hotel.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.440
And you know familiar with the facts about his death?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
I am.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.920
And what's your version of it?

03:29.920 --> 03:31.440
That he tried to escape.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.440
That he tried to escape?

03:32.440 --> 03:33.440
Yes, sir.

03:33.440 --> 03:38.040
Then your testimony, the testimony of Mr. Balls, was before the other day who stayed

03:38.040 --> 03:41.080
just now, is that he didn't try to escape.

03:41.080 --> 03:44.920
That he rigged together the sheet and the wire, and let himself out the window

03:44.920 --> 03:48.120
with the intention of grinding in the floor below and coming up and tapping on the door

03:48.120 --> 03:50.080
and say, Tika-boo, I'm back again.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.320
I've got it.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.360
You knew that, didn't you?

03:53.360 --> 03:57.040
Why, how could anyone tell what was in Reles' mind?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.080
Well, that's what we want to know.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.080
Of course, it's ridiculous, of course.

04:00.080 --> 04:03.560
Well, I couldn't tell what was in his mind.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.320
Oh, I know that there was the rope from there, was the sheet.

04:07.320 --> 04:14.400
And there was the window underneath, which he could reach, and it slipped, and he fell

04:14.400 --> 04:18.600
and was killed, and what he was trying to do.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.200
We'll never be known.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.600
When did the perfect case become an infurfication, how?

04:23.600 --> 04:25.120
When Reles died.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.120
When Reles died.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.120
And he was the only witness that you needed to confirm somebody's health's testimony.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.600
The only witness that I had.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.600
Only had.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.600
That was independent truth.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.280
I see.

04:36.280 --> 04:43.000
So when Reles died for done, when Reles passed on, then you lost the most valuable witness

04:43.000 --> 04:45.880
you could have to get a conviction of anesthesia, that right?

04:45.880 --> 04:46.880
That is right.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.480
Therefore, that didn't mean that there was another evidence.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.480
That is right.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.480
Yes, I understand.

04:51.480 --> 04:58.200
But didn't your mind, or did your mind, then turn upon the cause of the labor, and wonder

04:58.200 --> 05:05.600
who were the accessories either before or after the fact that made Reles part this life.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.200
And on that basis, I might add before you answer it, opinions differ.

05:09.200 --> 05:14.080
So from the important witnesses, as to how Mr. Reles departed this life, and why, you

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
have one opinion, and I have another.

05:16.080 --> 05:20.600
Mr. Balls had two or three, he has expressed his different times, and but we know he's

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
dead.

05:21.600 --> 05:26.440
Now, therefore, wasn't that worth the greatest endeavor in the world to find out who was

05:26.440 --> 05:31.520
culpable in reducing Miss Man Reles to a corpse, so the evidence could solve the window

05:31.520 --> 05:33.200
and you can't prosecute the match.

05:33.200 --> 05:54.520
I know, at the time, what the medical examiner said.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.840
I knew what he said was the cause of death.

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
What was that?

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
Far.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.840
At all.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.840
Did you see the body?

06:02.840 --> 06:03.840
No, sir.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.800
Were there any marks on it's your knowledge, the bullet shots on stabs and duck?

06:07.800 --> 06:10.440
Why the medical examiner's are proof of that?

06:10.440 --> 06:11.440
Yeah.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.440
Did anybody testify to besides the medical examiner?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.440
No, sir.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.040
I asked to that, I said no.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.040
No, sir.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.000
Don't the police usually go and look at the corpse after the medical examiner's while he's

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
examining it?

06:21.000 --> 06:25.800
I've been 40 years in this city, and I never did see the police or anyone else do anything

06:25.800 --> 06:32.680
but identify the body, and the responsibility for stating the cause of death is only

06:32.680 --> 06:33.680
on one man.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.160
So that's the medical examiner?

06:35.160 --> 06:41.240
If my body's found out here in Foli Square, or clothed and I'm taken to the morgue and

06:41.240 --> 06:46.080
the police suspect that some of these gangsters murdered Charles Toby, then all that would

06:46.080 --> 06:50.360
happen would be the morgue, would have my body, the medical examiner examined it, and

06:50.360 --> 06:52.720
certified death by such such a thing.

06:52.720 --> 06:57.160
But no member of the police had detected a squad of the b-there to confirm the sight

06:57.160 --> 07:00.840
of the body and whether or not to have produced some of the cause of death, they're merely

07:00.840 --> 07:01.840
falling out of the car.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.840
Is that right?

07:02.840 --> 07:07.600
Presenting what he considers a reflection on the medical examiner's honesty, the witness

07:07.600 --> 07:09.640
clashes with Senator Toby.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.920
That is precisely the annual window and I say it's unfair.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.440
Well, as a joke, they have been fixed on history.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.440
That's unfair.

07:16.440 --> 07:20.240
And if you see this way, go to your man-balls and correct his mind.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.240
These are the matter fixed.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.240
My man-balls?

07:23.240 --> 07:24.240
Yeah, your man-you appointed.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.240
You as a member of the police.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.240
Yeah, you appointed it.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.240
My man.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.480
The more than he is, you're appointed, didn't you?

07:29.480 --> 07:30.480
Of course.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.480
The official squad hit of it.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.480
That's right.

07:32.480 --> 07:37.920
Ditterness that leads to a sharp exchange about an alleged contribution from New York to

07:37.920 --> 07:40.480
Senator Toby's political campaign fund.

07:40.480 --> 07:45.320
And your dog, now where it came from?

07:45.320 --> 07:48.000
I didn't send down his New York for a single dollar.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You called up?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I did not.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.400
Well, now, would you like to go under that?

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
Yes, I would.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
All right.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.400
Now, challenge you.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.200
All right, is there a Mr. Rosenblatt in the room?

07:59.200 --> 08:05.200
Is there a Mr. Rosenblatt here?

08:05.200 --> 08:14.200
There was an authorization down here that went out to beat Pat McCarran and Nevada, and

08:14.200 --> 08:16.200
they supported you.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.520
And the story that is circulated down here is that you called up in the long distance

08:20.520 --> 08:24.120
telephone to get the help and that you got money.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
Well, it's not true.

08:25.120 --> 08:29.240
I never called anybody from New York for contributions to my campaign.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.600
All right, I'm on the rope and you're in that, sir.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.600
Well, I'll take the oath right now.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.880
You'll give it, Mr. Chairman.

08:34.880 --> 08:42.520
I hate a full flesher.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.200
Next day, Old wire produces the letter on which he based his observation about the funds

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
in question.

08:47.200 --> 08:51.920
Admitting it was merely a common expression of gratitude, free of any suggestion of political

08:51.920 --> 08:54.600
chicaneery.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.920
This really is making a big point over a colloquial that started in the heat of passion.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.120
There's nothing to it.

09:02.120 --> 09:06.000
Senator Keephober, after reading the letter, agrees with the ambassador on the innocence

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
of the message.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.400
And Senator Toby is placated, thanking both for giving Mr. Witness and to the distinguished

09:12.400 --> 09:15.600
Chairman of this committee, for clearing the air of this sub-defeuge.

09:15.600 --> 09:20.480
I'm a free man, and I'm willing anything I ever did.

09:20.480 --> 09:26.120
I'll say it, I'll roll to stand the light of day to anybody, friend of all I like.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.160
So I welcome these things and pass them on.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.160
Let's get on with the hearing.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.640
Aper.

09:32.640 --> 09:39.800
The brother of Albert Anastasia, Anthony, came before the committee in New York with some

09:39.800 --> 09:43.800
revealing answers to the investigators' questions.

09:44.800 --> 09:54.360
Now give your full name, Anthony Anastasia, and your address, 167 Union Street.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.760
How long have you lived there?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.600
By 11, 12 years.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
What do you do for a living?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.760
Long with Shonen, Steve, though.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.080
How long have you been engaged in that?

10:07.080 --> 10:09.960
Since I remember, sir.

10:09.960 --> 10:17.080
Do you know a police officer named Winkelman of the Elizabeth Police?

10:17.080 --> 10:19.600
Maybe if I see, sir.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.480
Don't you know him by name, the man to whom I'm referring?

10:22.480 --> 10:24.360
I can't recall, sir.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.480
You said that you never had theodore Narecheph arrested.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.720
I'd like to ask you if he had you arrested.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.720
I do believe so.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.040
You do?

10:34.040 --> 10:36.800
What was the outcome of the case?

10:36.800 --> 10:39.920
The case was on the front of the jury and I come out of the prison.

10:39.920 --> 10:46.000
Officer Winkelman of the Elizabeth Force Testifier for you?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Force Testifier?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.040
No, I say of the Elizabeth Police that he testified for you.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.040
I do believe so.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.040
But why did you doubt that you knew him and the man to go and I asked you if you had...

10:54.040 --> 10:56.240
Well, you could have called a minor, but the case I remember...

10:56.240 --> 10:59.440
You knew what I was going to ask you about him.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.440
But you do know now who I mean.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.640
What's the one policeman who testified for me, sir?

11:03.640 --> 11:09.240
Yes, but Officer, and you don't know that his name was Winkelman?

11:09.240 --> 11:11.000
The Alibi, didn't you?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I think you're pun.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.360
What did he testify to?

11:14.360 --> 11:16.600
How did you come to have him testify for you?

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
Show me a lawyer, sir.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.600
Show your lawyer.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.200
You gave your lawyers his name?

11:20.200 --> 11:21.200
No, sir.

11:21.200 --> 11:25.000
How did your lawyers know to get him to testify for you if you didn't give him the information?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.480
My lawyer got to Elizabeth.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.200
They knew where to go to get somebody for you.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.200
No, sir.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.040
All right.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.120
Did your brother make his money in your...

11:36.120 --> 11:37.880
A steve-during company?

11:37.880 --> 11:39.120
Little bit.

11:39.160 --> 11:39.960
How much?

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
Solid.

11:40.960 --> 11:41.480
Hmm?

11:41.480 --> 11:42.560
Solid.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.200
What was his salary?

11:44.200 --> 11:48.200
I believe it was under 141,000 that light.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.240
$100,000, $100,000, $90,000.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.720
I don't want to lie to you.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.240
I know you used to take your salary, sir.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.760
About $100,000, $100,000 a week.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.080
But $29,000, $100,000, someone there yet.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.640
And, uh, like that, sir.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.880
Do you ever hear that the house out at Palisades

12:04.880 --> 12:10.920
that belongs to your brother is worth an excess of $70,000?

12:10.920 --> 12:12.160
Never, sir.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.440
What do you think it's worth?

12:13.440 --> 12:16.880
$65, $66,000, $65,000.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.080
LAUGHTER

12:20.080 --> 12:24.360
After that, the committee became interested in the manner in which the witness got his naturalization

12:24.360 --> 12:30.080
papers to become a citizen of the United States.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.560
Senator O'Connor was the questioner.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.840
This is the exchange as recorded by the Moteton-U sound camera.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.320
It was jumping ship.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.400
I don't believe the system.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.760
You do believe so.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.280
And if you didn't put that in, then you made a false application.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.600
All right, don't believe it.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.560
You believe you put in.

12:44.560 --> 12:48.480
But now, suppose you didn't put it in, wouldn't that be a false application?

12:48.480 --> 12:49.120
Yes, sir.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.120
It would be.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.480
If that's true, then, you're a fit subject for deportation.

12:53.480 --> 12:57.880
And maybe those who pulled your card out, or otherwise, uh, didn't succeed after all,

12:57.880 --> 13:01.200
maybe in holding you over here too long.

13:01.320 --> 13:05.440
At another session of the crime probe, Ambassador O'Duire was again a witness.

13:05.440 --> 13:11.440
This time to vigorously deny that he accepted $10,000 from a fireman's representative.

13:11.440 --> 13:16.520
It's utterly fantastic, he told reporters.

13:16.520 --> 13:22.080
John J. Moran, a deputy fire commissioner under O'Duire, also denied receiving large sums

13:22.080 --> 13:27.480
from the same source, though admitting $500 for benefit tickets.

13:27.480 --> 13:32.560
Then the investigators heard John P. Crane, president of the Uniformed Fireman's Association,

13:32.560 --> 13:37.760
explored this political bombshell naming O'Duire and Moran.

13:37.760 --> 13:47.200
I told him, Mayor, at that time, that, uh, I had promised him the support of the fireman,

13:47.200 --> 13:53.560
and I offered him some evidence of that support on the occasion in a form of $10,000.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.520
And, uh, was that in cash?

13:55.520 --> 13:57.040
I wasn't cash.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.000
Was that a loot or a, in a, uh, packet?

14:00.000 --> 14:03.080
I had it, and, uh, I could never describe the envelope.

14:03.080 --> 14:07.200
I don't know the technical word, but it was a rate, this type of envelope,

14:07.200 --> 14:09.720
they have right there, the brown one.

14:09.720 --> 14:13.640
Oh, was it just about the size of the envelope that I'm just going to send it envelope?

14:13.640 --> 14:15.640
I rate $10.

14:15.640 --> 14:20.080
And, um, did he say anything?

14:20.080 --> 14:20.960
He psyched me.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.720
He didn't look in the envelope or anything else.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.960
How long were you there?

14:27.240 --> 14:29.640
Now, more than 10 minutes.

14:29.640 --> 14:37.440
Did you make any other contributions, uh, to anyone else in the, uh, campaign of 1949?

14:37.440 --> 14:40.240
Did you make any to Mr. Moran?

14:40.240 --> 14:42.400
Oh, yes.

14:42.400 --> 14:46.360
And, uh, what contributions did you make to him?

14:46.360 --> 14:52.320
I made $2,000, $10,000 contribution to him between that time and between election day.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.680
And, uh, was they also in cash?

14:55.680 --> 14:56.840
Yes, sir.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.720
And, where did you give them to Mr. Moran?

14:58.720 --> 15:03.600
He gave one behind him in this book, building on his way home one night.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.600
Oh, one day I gave one on his office.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
Does that make it total of $55,000?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.680
So, $55,000.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.320
James Moran got from you.

15:14.320 --> 15:19.200
That was a, I'd say that you think Mr. Moran's a good man and has helped you fire him.

15:19.200 --> 15:24.960
I'm going to say this, that what the fine man has to put up with,

15:24.960 --> 15:30.640
forget adjustments in salary and everything else that everyone else is getting,

15:30.640 --> 15:32.280
is absolutely a disgrace.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.280
Well, that's a crime.

15:33.280 --> 15:33.960
I agree with you.

15:33.960 --> 15:34.880
I did wrong.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.120
But the point I make is, this is the picture.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.640
Here's the people of the city of New York, New Jersey of them,

15:39.640 --> 15:43.040
their taxpayers, their tax to support a police department,

15:43.040 --> 15:47.800
and their fire department to protect them from the criminal element and their ravages of fire.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.480
And their officials have paid a good salary and they're on the job for Bono Public Old.

15:52.480 --> 15:56.320
Now it develops, but this man's second in charge of the fire department.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.960
He paid $55,000 to get goodwill.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.120
It ought to be an automatic thing with him, hasn't it?

16:03.120 --> 16:06.720
I've been forthcoming without any, for your dollars, isn't it?

16:06.720 --> 16:09.840
He ought to do this thing, justice for the fireman shouldn't he?

16:09.840 --> 16:13.080
I, I am sure Mr. Moran did.

16:13.080 --> 16:20.560
But when you have pressure groups in opposition, such as you must know about coming from Washington, Mr. Senator,

16:20.560 --> 16:24.240
it takes a man of tremendous courage to go out and stand up to them.

16:24.240 --> 16:28.360
Well, when such a man is just signed for him,

16:28.360 --> 16:33.720
they'll pull the law and to serve the public and there can be no greater cause than that.

16:33.720 --> 16:39.320
Yet these immense sums, to some of us immense sums, were spent and you.

16:39.320 --> 16:42.960
And I tell you something, think about in America, and it's about time we woke up.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.040
And instead of causing down this investigation of this crime committee,

16:47.080 --> 16:52.720
on the evidence giving here today, they ought to be renewed and carried on all the way down through.

16:52.720 --> 17:06.960
The scene shifted to Washington, DC, after the sensational disclosures at the New York investigation,

17:06.960 --> 17:10.480
and the chamber was packed for the resumption of the hearings.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.640
The national standing of the probe, resulting in Senator Wiley appearing on the stand

17:14.640 --> 17:18.480
with Senator Kefauber and with Senator O'Connor, Senator Hunt,

17:18.480 --> 17:24.640
all were hopeful of hearing testimony by Jacob Gusik, a witness from Chicago considered important.

17:24.640 --> 17:30.920
But Gusik disappointed by declaring he would refuse to answer any questions whatsoever.

17:30.920 --> 17:36.800
In other words, any kind of a question about any subject you're going to refuse to answer.

17:36.800 --> 17:44.440
And it doesn't matter what the nature of the question is or what it relates to, is that correct?

17:44.440 --> 17:45.440
All right.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.440
You will resident of Chicago.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.440
Now, it seems to answer that.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.440
How long have you lived in Chicago?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.440
It seems to answer that.

17:55.440 --> 18:00.440
I want to remind you, I claim the same privilege to have you answer.

18:00.440 --> 18:08.440
In other words, your statement applies to all of these questions from the start to finish.

18:08.440 --> 18:15.440
It is therefore the decision of the committee that this witness

18:15.440 --> 18:26.440
be continued under Sipina, that he be remanded to the custody of the sergeant arms of the Senate,

18:26.440 --> 18:36.440
that he be required to remain under the Sipina and to reappear before this committee on Friday,

18:36.440 --> 18:39.440
March 30th at 10am.

18:39.440 --> 18:49.440
He will be kept in custody and it is the decision of the committee that he may obtain his release only upon

18:49.440 --> 18:56.440
having placed under bond in the amount of $10,000.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.440
What can I make the bond?

18:59.440 --> 19:07.440
Well, you will be get sufficient advice from the representative of the sergeant arms.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.440
Captain Down.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.440
The who?

19:15.440 --> 19:22.440
Concluding this remarkable newsreo document, Chairman Kippover asked the local public to carry on.

19:22.440 --> 19:28.440
As matters now stand, I have great conviction and a very firm belief.

19:28.440 --> 19:33.440
At the people in local sections appreciate the conditions that are going on.

19:33.440 --> 19:41.440
They realize that what we have found in one city can be duplicated and usually exist in another city of the same population.

19:41.440 --> 19:48.440
The conditions we have found in one area are usually the same conditions that can be found in another.

19:48.440 --> 19:56.440
So in the final analysis, it is the interest and the action of the local people that is going to whip organized crime in the country today.

19:56.440 --> 20:07.440
I believe they have been aroused. I think they know the facts and I believe that the people and not the Congress of the federal government will do the job.
