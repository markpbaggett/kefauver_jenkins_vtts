00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Competition is, I'd have to, if you want Australia, I can get the actual who's selling and what the situation is.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Well, you have an exclusive license from Ron Polack.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Ron Polack.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Polack for Australia, don't you?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
No.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
We unfortunately don't.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Who are ourselves in Australia?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Well, there are several.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Well, that shows then that where there's comp, you make a profit in Australia, don't you?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Yes, we do.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
Then where there's competition with somebody, then you get your price down to meet the competition.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Where there is no competition, you've got your price way up.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Is that what we would understand?

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
No, I'm not prepared to agree with that.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Well, what would you say about it?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Well, because...

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
What do you mean by local conditions?

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Well, there's the local currency, there's the local rates of employment.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Well, there's the local fees that we have to pay.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Australia has a medical list.

00:58.000 --> 01:07.000
This is put on the medical list and the selling of it is a much different problem than it is in the United States.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
I mean, there are a lot of local conditions that exist.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Australia has a partly socialized medicine program under which they list these items.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
If you can get your product on the list, then the physician must select from that list.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Sparing happens to be one of the ones that's listed in Australia.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, there is no price control in Australia, as I understand.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Pardon?

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
There is no price control in Australia as I have been informed.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, if you want to get yourself on that medical list, there is some...

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
But the point, the whole point is, in this illustrates it, really, Mr. Brush, that...

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
You've got a company in Australia and remarkably, in some of the products we have seen, such as...

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
No, that's not...

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
No, that's not...

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Such as Thorazine.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
We find Australia paying very large prices.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Some of them are quite above the United States on some of the products we've had.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
But here now, where you have a plant and you say you're competing, you can make a profit.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
And yet you sell at 94 cents.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes, we could ship Sparine from Australia in here much cheaper than we can make it.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
If that's what I understand, the committee would like us to do.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Which, of course, will result in an unemployment to American citizens who we understood.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
We would try and maintain, this is nothing that's unusual to the drug industry.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
You can buy anything you want in these foreign markets, much cheaper than you can buy them in the American market.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
Well, there may be some... there is some difference, I'm sure, in the wage rate...

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Three times.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I don't know what it is, but actually...

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Give me my...

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Difference between 94 cents and $3 is a...

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Just about three times.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
You're just multiplied by three.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
I should only mean all this is wages.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Pretty near.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Because our information...

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Our information is that...

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
In the actual...

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
The actual making of a chemical at the...

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, but it's the selling...

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Well, just many machinery...

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Mr. Hoyt, the president of Carter Products, then offered for the record,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
an exhibit showing the cost breakdown from Milltown.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
His manufacturing cost, which on his table are labeled actual...

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Manufacturing cost actual...

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
0.7 cents, 7 cents per tablet.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Exactly the same figure that had been computed by the subcommitted staff.

04:15.000 --> 04:25.000
And the subcommitted staff figured that the price that...

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
By using another laboratory that...

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
My similar laboratory might be sold to the wholesaler,

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
was 5.2 cents per tablet.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Mr. Hoyt says that...

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
He receives from the wholesaler 5.1 cents per tablet.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
He won for cash discount, he said, which we didn't know anything about.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
And I think he allowed for some cash discount, which we didn't know anything about.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
It was not as correct.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
And the consumer, 28 or 29.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
And in the other, what cost 0.7 cents, 7.10% to produce,

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
ends up by costing a wholesaler 4.1 cents.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
A 5.1 cents in the drugest...

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
6.5 cents.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
And the consumer over 10 cents.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
But the answer can be, or should be, to this problem,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I don't, frankly, don't know.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
But we are dealing with the most vital necessity of life,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
of any product in our economy drugs.

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
In a matter of a diamond ring,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
some purely luxury diamond ring for a man,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
of course, a diamond ring for a woman may be a necessity,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
but a diamond ring for a man may not be a luxury.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
The public interest is not so involved, if there is a very large profit,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
very large price.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
But here we're dealing with drugs which are vital to people,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
in which we can to sick people.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
And this ethical...

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, on the last bit I have here,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
the kind of bifier kids,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
is what they're talking about.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
These records cost us 30 cents to reach the doctor.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Now, I can read what the records are.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
These records have musical selections on one side,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
and information-informative statements concerning certain

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
of our products on the other.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
This approach is one long used in the picture.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
And just because of things our cheap are abroad,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
that's why we have protective tariffs in this country,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
because our American industry cannot compete

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
with the lowest scale of living abroad.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
All right, but the point is,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
we'll make that a part of the record exhibit, 191.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
What you're saying, Mr. Hoyt, is that...

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
I think I remember your words almost exactly,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
that you have to get your prices down in connection

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
with the standard of living in these various countries.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, that's a very noble purpose,

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
but the thing I want to point out to you is that there are lots of...

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
well, maybe a big group of people with much wealth

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
in the United States, maybe a very high income,

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
upper middle class, millions and millions of people

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
living on social security, poor people, incomes down,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
and they're having to buy this product,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
just like the wealthier people.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
As I interpret what you say by taking into consideration

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
the standard of living and making your prices fit that,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
that just means that you charge what the traffic will bear

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
according to the standard of living in the country.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
No, I'll name Mr. Chairman.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I didn't explain myself correctly then.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
What I said was this.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
That.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
In.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
What I said was this.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Not to a person in the Argentine.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
They price must be multiplied by 13

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
to get the same thing as it is to an American citizen.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Now, that's the only thing I said.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Well, the thing is that.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That's not a question of getting the question now.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Well, that's exactly what I was saying.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
In other words, in the Argentine at the present price,

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
the real town is just as expensive to an Argentine as it is

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
to an American or just as cheap as you would like it.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Well, the thing about the whole thing is, though, Mr. Hoyt.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
In many cases here, this product is made in the United States.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
At a.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
And sold your subsidiary or.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Or to one of your own.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
No, the power.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I mean, sold another company or to one of your subsidiaries.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
And so we're talking about.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Your prices.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
One, Mr. Chairman, we do not ship powder out of the United States.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
It's what you did in 1958.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
You ship powder out of the United States.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
A product didn't ship out.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
But American cyanomed ship powder out of the United States.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
I think American cyanomed ship to some.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
You sold it to.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
And the white laboratory.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
White laboratory ships it out of the United States.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
It literally sells ships it out of the United States.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
And the thing is that just because the average,

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
maybe American people's income is higher, there's no reason why.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.000
I can't see any reason why you can't give the same break to the American people

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
that you can to the people in the United States.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't think that the U.S. and people are getting a break.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
And in their standards it's cost just as much.

10:37.000 --> 10:48.000
Well, for instance, you charge, I noticed here in India,

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
certainly their standard of living is very much less than ours.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Any, most, less than most, great many nations.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
You charge a higher price in $479, $425.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Please, let's a challenge.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Iran and Iran.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I say literally in white do.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
That's not you because I don't.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
We understand that.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
With your milled-down trade name.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
And of course we want to address the same question to the other people.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
But you're the basis of the whole thing.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
You're a product that's being sold.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Take your Iran.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
And the standard of living there is certainly not comparable to ours.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And prices are higher.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Well, Mr. Chairman is an era here in Iran.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
They say Wallace Laboratory sells an era.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And that isn't sold.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
No.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Listen, fiction.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Have you looked back on it, Senator?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Do you think?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Well, I tell you the truth.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
I made so many mistakes that I wouldn't know how to start enumerating.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
But if I had it all to go over it to do again, I think I'd do it just the same way.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
The only way I know to get anywhere is to get out in percenture calls when lose your draw through the best you can.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Now, I think I should say this.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
The losing of some prime areas is not without its good positive effect.

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
I'm quite certain that the primary in California, for instance, has done more to revive and to interest Democrats

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
and really to pull them together for the first time in a long, long time.

12:29.000 --> 12:38.000
And anything that's happened, and for the first time in a century, the Democrats, I believe, will control the Senate of California.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I believe that they will have a better organization that they will elect.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
What?

13:12.000 --> 13:22.000
Thank you.
