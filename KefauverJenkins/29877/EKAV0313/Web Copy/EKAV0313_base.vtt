WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
Yeah.

00:17.300 --> 00:20.420
Stephen some keep off her campaign committee and

00:20.420 --> 00:22.420
watch you to stay tuned now while we bring you a

00:22.420 --> 00:25.320
special broadcast live from New York City.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.060
Here now are two of America's most popular

00:28.060 --> 00:32.660
political leaders. My name is Esther

00:32.660 --> 00:35.140
S. Keefover and I think that you know

00:35.140 --> 00:38.040
that gracious and wonderful lady beside me.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.740
Mrs. Delano Roosevelt. Thank you, Senator Keefover.

00:41.740 --> 00:45.140
I know you have some very important things to say

00:45.140 --> 00:48.140
to our radio and television audience this evening.

00:48.140 --> 00:53.060
So I will take up much of your time. I just want to tell you

00:53.060 --> 00:56.620
how very glad I am that you're speaking

00:56.620 --> 01:00.720
tonight to a nationwide television audience.

01:00.720 --> 01:04.400
I understand your great talk about the Republican

01:04.400 --> 01:07.840
record of the last four years.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.800
And you know I don't think there's anyone better

01:11.800 --> 01:16.600
equipped to talk about this subject than Senator Keefover.

01:16.600 --> 01:21.340
He's been in Congress for 18 years now and he's had a

01:21.340 --> 01:26.320
very distinguished career as Senator from Tennessee.

01:26.320 --> 01:32.360
I remember open back in 1951 the Capitol Hill newsmen who

01:32.360 --> 01:36.560
know our legislators more intimately than anyone else.

01:36.560 --> 01:41.400
Pick Senator Keefover as one of the two best men in the

01:41.400 --> 01:47.320
United States Senate. And I imagine many people do not know

01:47.320 --> 01:50.920
that Senator Keefover wrote a classic book on the

01:50.920 --> 01:56.040
workings of our Congress. It was called 20th century

01:56.040 --> 02:02.800
Congress and had much to do with later legislative reorganization.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.680
I think Esther Keefover, Natalie Stevenson, make up a

02:07.680 --> 02:13.200
superb democratic ticket for President and Vice President.

02:13.200 --> 02:18.280
Governor Stevenson and Senator Keefover are carrying the

02:18.280 --> 02:22.440
banner of liberalism in this election. The people won't

02:22.440 --> 02:27.760
be fooled by Republican talk to the contrary. The Republican

02:27.760 --> 02:34.080
party is today as it has been for many years the party of

02:34.080 --> 02:39.800
reaction. The history of the past four years proves it. I

02:39.800 --> 02:44.520
think you intend to look at that history tonight Senator Keefover.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.840
Yes, I do, Mrs. Roosevelt.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.080
So I leave you now and let you go to work.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.320
Well, I want to thank you very much for the lovely things

02:54.320 --> 02:57.320
you've said about me and for coming here this evening.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.520
Thank you for that. Thank you, Ms. Roosevelt.

03:00.520 --> 03:05.000
Well, friends, as Mrs. Roosevelt said, this evening I want to

03:05.000 --> 03:08.640
discuss with you the Republican record. What I'm going to

03:08.640 --> 03:12.920
say is based not only on what I think, but what the people

03:12.920 --> 03:16.760
I've met all over the country have told me. For do you know

03:16.760 --> 03:21.000
what I found out? I found out that you the American people

03:21.000 --> 03:25.640
have good long memories. You remember candidate Eisenhower's

03:25.640 --> 03:30.880
promises in the 1952 campaign and you remember how they were

03:30.880 --> 03:35.840
broken. Now here in our television and radio studio where

03:35.840 --> 03:39.240
you've set up what we call the Republican gallery of broken

03:39.240 --> 03:43.680
promises. In this gallery you'll find figures, you'll find

03:43.680 --> 03:47.840
the facts and the figures. We'll show you the pictures too of

03:47.840 --> 03:51.160
the Eisenhower broken promises and how they were broken

03:51.160 --> 03:57.560
between the election time 1952 and election time 1956. You

03:57.560 --> 04:00.720
can see that they cover quite a range of subjects, the cost

04:00.720 --> 04:07.920
of living, taxes, labor, farms, atomic energy, and 1952

04:07.920 --> 04:11.880
and ever since Mr. Roosevelt has promised everything to

04:11.880 --> 04:15.880
everybody, but he has given everything to the privileged

04:15.880 --> 04:20.280
few. Now let's look at the Eisenhower promise to reduce the

04:20.280 --> 04:27.000
cost of living. There was a whomy touch about about this one. He

04:27.000 --> 04:30.320
told a television audience that may me got after him about the

04:30.320 --> 04:35.480
problem. Mr. Cameron Mann, let's see that show. Let's look back

04:35.480 --> 04:40.240
at 1952. Why may he get after me about the high cost of living?

04:40.240 --> 04:44.800
It's another reason why I say he is time for the change. Time to

04:44.800 --> 04:48.600
get back to an honest dollar and an honest dollar's worth. An

04:48.600 --> 04:51.560
honest dollar's worth. Look what happened, look what's the

04:51.560 --> 04:55.200
best look and see what's happened since. Rint has gone up 11

04:55.200 --> 05:00.280
percent, gas and electricity 6 percent, other fuels 5, housekeeping

05:00.280 --> 05:06.920
cost up 7 percent. Medical care up 9 percent. This summer the cost

05:06.920 --> 05:11.280
of living rose to its highest point in history. Is that what

05:11.280 --> 05:15.200
bringing down the cost of living means? Now who is profiting

05:15.200 --> 05:19.480
by these high prices? Take the cost of meat or the farmers

05:19.480 --> 05:23.360
getting the profits. No because farm prices on meats have

05:23.360 --> 05:27.600
fallen to their lowest level in years. Yet during the very

05:27.600 --> 05:33.360
six month period when hogs were lowest, the giant sweet meat

05:33.360 --> 05:37.480
packing company had its profits doubled. Armor packing

05:37.480 --> 05:41.240
companies profits triple in the same period. That's where the

05:41.240 --> 05:45.840
profits are going to the very big businesses. And now we don't

05:45.840 --> 05:49.880
object to a large business just because it's large business.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.400
But what we do object to is when these big businesses profit

05:53.400 --> 05:58.320
at the expense of the farmer, the working man and the consumer.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.840
The Eisenhower Nixon administration broke its promise to hold the

06:01.840 --> 06:06.160
line on prices and gave the breaks to the big businesses to

06:06.160 --> 06:10.400
boot. Now let's open the gallery of broken promises to the subject

06:10.400 --> 06:15.720
of taxes. What did Mr. Eisenhower promise us on that subject in

06:15.720 --> 06:21.040
1952? Our cameraman can show you what Eisenhower said on a

06:21.040 --> 06:29.880
commercial television. This is 1952. Mr. Eisenhower, what are you

06:29.880 --> 06:33.880
going to do about taxes? We are going to bring them down.

06:33.880 --> 06:37.480
And here's how. We are going to cut out the billions of

06:37.480 --> 06:41.120
washing in his waste. And put that money back in the pocket

06:41.120 --> 06:46.320
for the peace. Well, the folks in Washington now just look at

06:46.320 --> 06:50.520
President Eisenhower totally press conference. This year, this

06:50.520 --> 06:58.600
is 1956. No logical reason for reducing taxes. And I really

06:58.600 --> 07:03.120
believe it would be to do not do the good in itself the America to

07:03.120 --> 07:07.000
reduce it to more. Well, the Eisenhower Nixon administration

07:07.000 --> 07:11.760
did cut taxes all right. But it was the most unfair tax cut in

07:11.760 --> 07:16.480
the history of our nation. Let's look at this. 91 cents of

07:16.480 --> 07:20.200
every dollar in tax cut went to the upper income families and

07:20.200 --> 07:25.720
to the corporations. And only 9 cents went to the rest of us.

07:25.720 --> 07:32.320
Let me show you how this works out. Let's take two families

07:32.320 --> 07:37.200
for instance. Each with a man and a wife and with two children.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.440
Each earns $5,000 a year. But one of these workers works in

07:41.440 --> 07:47.440
a steel plan, working at an open-heart print. It hours a day.

07:47.440 --> 07:53.160
Under the Eisenhower Nixon tax plan, he pays $420 a year

07:53.160 --> 07:57.520
taxes. Now the other man is a large stockholder. His

07:57.520 --> 08:01.560
investments are in US steel or some other corporation. And they

08:01.560 --> 08:07.120
yield him $5,000 a year. Under the Eisenhower Nixon tax plan,

08:07.120 --> 08:12.920
he pays $200. Figure it out yourself. The man who works far

08:12.920 --> 08:17.880
alive has to pay more than twice as much in taxes as the man who

08:17.880 --> 08:22.120
gets his income from clipping coupons. When the Republicans

08:22.120 --> 08:26.160
tell you they've reduced taxes, they're telling you only half

08:26.160 --> 08:31.160
of the truth. What they really don is to reduce taxes for the rich

08:31.160 --> 08:35.800
and left the rest of us to thin far ourselves. Well, you let me

08:35.800 --> 08:37.800
illustrate this with a little cartoon.

08:42.440 --> 08:49.720
Taxes taxes. Ah, relief at last. But not for you, just for the

08:49.720 --> 08:54.920
few. Well, no one minds a little laugh. The serious point is that

08:54.920 --> 08:59.320
under the Eisenhower Nixon plan, the national death has gone up

08:59.320 --> 09:05.040
$13 billion in spite of our continuing high taxes. This

09:05.040 --> 09:09.000
gallery is just full of interesting exhibits. Read about this

09:09.000 --> 09:13.080
this promise about Eisenhower's pledge to revise the tab

09:13.080 --> 09:18.480
partly law. Just in case you think that we made it up, let's stop

09:18.480 --> 09:20.760
and look at it on film.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.280
I'm going to hold it on my to use the break units. That must

09:25.280 --> 09:29.440
be changed. America wants your law. Why should the union

09:29.440 --> 09:33.600
about it? And need to do that. So what happened? I

09:33.600 --> 09:36.640
think that Eisenhower recommended some amendments to the tab

09:36.640 --> 09:39.680
partly all right, but they didn't even touch the union

09:39.680 --> 09:43.040
busting provisions of the act. On the contrary, they strengthen

09:43.040 --> 09:46.640
those provisions. They would prohibit states. They would

09:46.640 --> 09:50.320
permit states to prohibit strikes. They would let employers

09:50.320 --> 09:54.320
make any union speeches to captive employee audiences during

09:54.320 --> 09:58.560
work hours and more. Fortunately, solid democratic opposition

09:58.560 --> 10:02.720
defeated this move. What's more, President Eisenhower stacked

10:02.720 --> 10:06.560
the national labor relations board with pro labor spokesman,

10:06.560 --> 10:09.760
who promptly removed the board's protection from one out of

10:09.760 --> 10:13.520
every four workers it then covered. It is easy to see what

10:13.520 --> 10:17.200
happens when an administration favors big business over the

10:17.200 --> 10:21.360
working man. The profits of general motors are up

10:21.360 --> 10:29.840
113%. And yet, the earnings of the auto workers, their

10:29.840 --> 10:35.680
income is up on only 14%. And oh yes, ladies and gentlemen,

10:35.680 --> 10:42.000
corruption. Back in 1952, the Republicans launched their great

10:42.000 --> 10:45.600
crusade to clean up corruption. Throw out the Crooks and

10:45.600 --> 10:49.440
Cronies said General Eisenhower. Well, remember this film

10:49.440 --> 10:53.760
back in 1952. Who many politicians have sold their ideals of

10:53.760 --> 10:57.920
honesty down the Potomans? We must bring back integrity and

10:57.920 --> 11:02.080
thrift to Washington. This we are determined to do.

11:02.080 --> 11:07.200
Integrity and thrift. Under the Eisenhower Nixon administration,

11:07.200 --> 11:11.600
more heads of government agencies have been involved in corruption

11:11.600 --> 11:17.040
than under any administration since the Republican administration of General

11:17.040 --> 11:21.840
U.S. grant. Here are some of Eisenhower's friends.

11:21.840 --> 11:26.320
Friends he would like to forget, I'll wait you. This is Air Force

11:26.320 --> 11:30.960
Secretary Harold Talbot who used his office to try to pressure defense

11:30.960 --> 11:34.640
contractors and to using an engineering firm in which he was

11:34.640 --> 11:39.520
financially interested. When he left Washington, President Eisenhower

11:39.520 --> 11:44.320
praised him and actually gave him a medal. And this is a general services

11:44.320 --> 11:49.120
administrator, Ed Mansour, who tried to steer a big

11:49.120 --> 11:53.680
government contract to the right Republicans. And this is Peter

11:53.680 --> 11:58.560
Strobel, the public buildings administrator. Well, he tried to excuse his

11:58.560 --> 12:02.800
misconduct by saying he used his improper influence only

12:02.800 --> 12:07.840
quote during my lunch hour. But these were not the real big time

12:07.840 --> 12:13.280
operators. Let me show you one of the most rotten deals

12:13.280 --> 12:17.120
one of the most rotten deals in all American history.

12:17.120 --> 12:23.200
The Nixon Yates deal. Here was an attempt by big business men

12:23.200 --> 12:28.160
in and out of government to milk an entire region of our nation.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.840
Here are some of the people involved. Here is a eight-off

12:31.840 --> 12:36.640
wind zel over here. Attorney General Bronnell's Department of Justice set of

12:36.640 --> 12:40.800
him. The role played by wind zel involved a conflict of

12:40.800 --> 12:45.760
interest, so contrary to public policy as to render the alleged

12:45.760 --> 12:50.080
agreement null and void. Well, this man here, this is

12:50.080 --> 12:54.880
wind zel's boss, George Woods, an investment banker who wanted to

12:54.880 --> 12:59.840
exploit public power for private profit. And this is budget

12:59.840 --> 13:04.080
director Joseph Dodge, who helped George Woods on the

13:04.080 --> 13:07.440
Dixon Yates deal, actually brought him into the government.

13:07.440 --> 13:11.360
And Dich has of course, since left the government.

13:11.360 --> 13:15.760
And this over here is Sherman Adams, executive assistant to the

13:15.760 --> 13:19.360
president who tried to hush up the whole matter.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.200
Employees of the budget bureau testified that they were war not to even

13:23.200 --> 13:28.080
mention Mr. Wind zel's name or his job to anyone.

13:28.080 --> 13:33.120
And this is Attorney General Herbert Bronnell. For a year and a half,

13:33.120 --> 13:37.440
everyone knew that Dixon Yates deal was crooked and smell bad.

13:37.440 --> 13:42.160
And for a year and a half, Bronnell did absolutely nothing about it.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.520
Finally, the only thing that forced him into action, what was when

13:45.520 --> 13:50.000
Dixon and Yates sued the United States government and the force Mr. Bronnell

13:50.000 --> 13:54.720
into court. Do you call this cleaning up corruption fast?

13:54.720 --> 13:59.040
If these men had succeeded in putting over the Dixon Yates deal,

13:59.040 --> 14:03.840
it would have cost you and your government over a hundred million dollars

14:03.840 --> 14:08.480
in excessive cost. It would ultimately cost consumers everywhere,

14:08.480 --> 14:14.160
untold millions and higher power costs. And it would have wrecked the Tennessee

14:14.160 --> 14:18.640
Valley Authority. Now the worst things about these scandals

14:18.640 --> 14:23.280
is that even today, the members of the Eisenhower and Nixon team really think

14:23.280 --> 14:29.040
that they did no wrong in these deals. These men have never understood

14:29.040 --> 14:34.720
a concept of integrity and government that Woodrow Wilson spelled out long ago.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.160
It is that when big businessmen come to the government,

14:38.160 --> 14:42.880
they must learn the difference between the public welfare and their own financial

14:42.880 --> 14:48.080
interests. They must have forced themselves from these narrow interests and never

14:48.080 --> 14:53.040
confuse them with a general welfare. The big businessman of the Eisenhower

14:53.040 --> 15:00.000
Nixon team have never learned this and the result is real corruption.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.840
Now I'd like to show you one of the most callous promises

15:05.840 --> 15:11.360
ever made to a group of voters. Remember this statement here,

15:11.360 --> 15:14.880
ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure the farmers all over the United States

15:14.880 --> 15:21.040
remember it. The Republican Party has pledged a sustaining of 90 percent

15:21.040 --> 15:25.920
parity price supports and it is pledged even more than that to helping the

15:25.920 --> 15:30.640
farmer obtain his full parity, 100 percent parity,

15:30.640 --> 15:36.880
with a guarantee in the price support of 90 percent. General Eisenhower said that

15:36.880 --> 15:43.760
when he was campaigning in 1952 on October 4th, 1952 to be exact

15:43.760 --> 15:48.560
at Brookings South Dakota and he's had substantial of the same thing for a movie

15:48.560 --> 15:56.960
camera at Case-on Minnesota. Let's watch. This is 1952.

15:56.960 --> 16:02.480
Convinces me that they would rather earn their fair share than to have it as a

16:02.480 --> 16:07.680
government handout and a fair share.

16:10.880 --> 16:17.200
A fair share is not merely 90 percent of parity. It's full parity.

16:17.200 --> 16:21.200
Well, how the farmers voted for Eisenhower and his promise

16:21.200 --> 16:26.080
carried a lot of these farm states and instead they got agricultural secretary

16:26.080 --> 16:31.360
Ezra Tath-Bimson who had not this slightest intention at all of

16:31.360 --> 16:36.640
continuing 90 percent price supports, let alone 100 percent supports.

16:36.640 --> 16:42.320
Sure enough, as soon as the Eisenhower Benson team took office,

16:42.320 --> 16:48.000
it lowered many price supports. You'll see here and it lowered them more than that.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.760
And then down came prices, barley down 36 percent, corn 25 percent,

16:53.760 --> 17:02.720
raw 47 percent, sorghum down 43 percent. And what happens when prices fall?

17:02.720 --> 17:07.440
Then the farmer overproduces to make up for it to try to support his family

17:07.440 --> 17:13.520
and huge, great surfaces result. But there are more promises to come.

17:13.520 --> 17:18.800
In his Case-on speech, candidate Eisenhower promised to support perishables

17:18.800 --> 17:25.040
like meat and things like that. In 1952 he said and I want to quote exactly what he

17:25.040 --> 17:30.080
said, we must find methods of protecting producers of perishables.

17:30.080 --> 17:37.040
Now let's look at this press conference. This is 1956.

17:37.040 --> 17:42.880
I would believe that to go in this whole perishable field and begin a business

17:42.880 --> 17:46.560
of price support for the dangerous I'd want to study it more before expressing

17:46.560 --> 17:50.960
myself back. Well thanks to that broken promise,

17:50.960 --> 17:55.200
beef and whole prices fell as much as 42 percent.

17:55.200 --> 18:01.600
The sum in substance of this is, forever dollar farmers netted in 1952.

18:01.600 --> 18:07.600
They net only 75 cents today. This hasn't done the consumer one bit of good either.

18:07.600 --> 18:13.040
Because while farm prices have gone down, many grocery prices have gone up.

18:13.120 --> 18:18.640
Now let me ask you, how would you like to have your income cut by 25 percent,

18:18.640 --> 18:22.240
especially right now with the cost of living so high?

18:22.240 --> 18:27.440
I'll tell you this, the farmers don't like it one bit and I don't blame them.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.840
That's why both the farmer and the consumer are swinging right over into the

18:31.840 --> 18:36.080
democratic column this fall. Now you may ask, what do we

18:36.080 --> 18:40.560
Democrats propose to do about it? Well in the first place we're going to

18:40.560 --> 18:46.080
restore 90 percent of parity price supports for basic commodities and

18:46.080 --> 18:50.640
extend supports to other storeable and perishable commodities and stop

18:50.640 --> 18:54.720
this dangers and disastrous fall and farm income.

18:54.720 --> 18:59.280
Then we're going to see that the so-called surpluses are used to feed needy

18:59.280 --> 19:05.360
and worthwhile people. We have long urged the food stamp plan which worked very

19:05.360 --> 19:12.640
good in 1939 and 1940 and expanded school lunch program and an international

19:12.640 --> 19:18.000
food reserve so that our products will get into the empty stomachs of people

19:18.000 --> 19:22.800
instead of storehouses. We must enact these measures.

19:22.800 --> 19:27.680
Just last year the Democrats in the Congress of the United States

19:27.680 --> 19:33.440
sponsored a bill that would support farm prices at 90 percent of parity.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.200
We got that bill passed over the opposition of the Republicans.

19:37.200 --> 19:41.920
That bill would have done nothing else except put into effect what General Eisenhower

19:41.920 --> 19:47.200
himself promised and you know what happened? President Eisenhower

19:47.200 --> 19:51.360
vetoed the bill. Here's the bill, here's his veto.

19:51.360 --> 19:57.840
He vetoed his own promise. That veto has cost the farmers three billion dollars

19:57.840 --> 20:02.880
and it hasn't helped the consumer either. The only thing 100 percent about General

20:02.880 --> 20:09.360
Eisenhower's promise to the farmers is that it was broken 100 percent.

20:09.360 --> 20:14.800
Farmers like so many more Americans are going to vote Democratic this fall

20:14.800 --> 20:19.680
and let me tell you this. Secretary Benson has spent more on his sliding

20:19.680 --> 20:26.480
scale and his farm and his farm program. He spent twice as much and three and a

20:26.480 --> 20:31.200
half years as the Democrats plant on price supports in the whole 20 years

20:31.280 --> 20:36.160
of their administration and yet he let prices go down. And for the more

20:36.160 --> 20:40.720
under Benson farm surpluses have more than or three times more than they

20:40.720 --> 20:46.560
were when he took over in 1952. Now I've only shown you a few of the exhibits

20:46.560 --> 20:54.080
and the Eisenhower gallery of broken promises. I could show you many many more.

20:54.080 --> 20:58.960
Let's rest us just consider the plight of the small business man for a minute.

20:58.960 --> 21:02.800
I've been talking I've been around this country talking with small business

21:02.800 --> 21:07.840
men and I've seen too many scenes like the one that I'll ask our camera man

21:07.840 --> 21:14.400
now to show us. Going out of business says this says the science. This picture was

21:14.400 --> 21:19.760
taken just last month. Small business men like this are being squeezed out

21:19.760 --> 21:25.680
by the big ones. The rate of small business failures increased by 46 percent

21:25.680 --> 21:32.720
since 1952. Small business profits are 52 percent down

21:32.720 --> 21:40.160
while big business profits are 52 percent up since the Eisenhower Nixon

21:40.160 --> 21:45.040
administration took office and small businesses are not getting their fair share

21:45.040 --> 21:49.920
of government contracts. In Washington today the big corporations are getting

21:49.920 --> 21:55.360
more and more. 68 percent of all government procurement went to the top

21:55.360 --> 22:00.080
100 large corporations and that's not fair for the small business man.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.120
The small business men are not getting the relief

22:03.120 --> 22:07.920
the need in the way of taxation or the credit that they need. Small businesses

22:07.920 --> 22:12.080
are getting are not getting protection against the on-rush of monopolistic

22:12.080 --> 22:16.160
big business. In the United States Senate I have to write an

22:16.160 --> 22:21.840
anti-merger bill just to protect small business. That was six years ago.

22:21.840 --> 22:26.000
Only one or perhaps two cases have been brought under this law by the Eisenhower

22:26.000 --> 22:29.760
administration. Like the farmers small business men are

22:29.760 --> 22:34.880
facing extinction too because the Eisenhower Nixon administration has a

22:34.880 --> 22:40.800
tight and I mean a really tight money policy. Money loans are hard to get

22:40.800 --> 22:44.560
and with Christmas coming on small business men must stop up with new

22:44.560 --> 22:49.600
inventories. At the bank they find the credit they need is harder to get

22:49.600 --> 22:54.560
and more expensive bigger interest rates than ever before.

22:54.560 --> 22:58.880
Well ladies and gentlemen what is the answer to these broken promises?

22:58.880 --> 23:05.440
Remember them and vote Democrat. Now there's a very good reason

23:05.440 --> 23:11.360
why the Eisenhower promises were broken. They were broken

23:11.360 --> 23:16.400
because they were made by a man inexperienced and public affairs to begin with.

23:16.400 --> 23:21.120
Then after he was elected President Eisenhower surrounded himself with retired

23:21.120 --> 23:27.200
millionaires and large corporation executives who had some plans of their own.

23:27.200 --> 23:32.240
These men thought of President Eisenhower as their frontman. He was to say the

23:32.240 --> 23:37.440
nice things and make the promises. The Republican old guard which had failed to

23:37.440 --> 23:41.760
elect one of its own men since Herbert Hoover would be protected.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.280
Just what are the plans of the men around Eisenhower?

23:45.280 --> 23:50.400
I think that I can show you with a simple illustration the President's cabinet.

23:50.400 --> 23:55.200
Let's just take a look at the members of this plush big business cabinet.

23:55.200 --> 24:00.880
Where do they come from? What do they do? There is George Humphrey Secretary of

24:00.880 --> 24:05.600
Treasury. He was formerly President of the Emma Hanna Company one of the

24:05.600 --> 24:10.960
industrial giants of the nation and director of many other companies.

24:10.960 --> 24:16.480
The French Secretary Charles Wilson was of course President of General Motors,

24:16.480 --> 24:21.120
the largest manufacturing concern in the world. It was only natural that he

24:21.120 --> 24:25.520
should feel that what's good for General Motors is good for the country.

24:25.520 --> 24:30.400
Fred Seaton here is Secretary of the Interior. He was President of three publishing

24:30.400 --> 24:34.560
companies and two broadcasting companies in Kansas and Nebraska.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.680
And this is Secretary of Commerce in Claire Weeks.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.320
Well you know a funny thing happened the other night when President

24:40.320 --> 24:44.720
Eisenhower praised Mr. Weeks on television. I guess it was Mr. Weeks he was

24:44.720 --> 24:49.040
talking about where he said there is a businessman in the Commerce Department of

24:49.040 --> 24:52.080
Air Successful One, smaller businessman,

24:52.080 --> 24:56.560
jeweler and that kind of thing. In the quotation,

24:56.560 --> 25:00.080
well some jeweler, Weeks of us chairman of the United

25:00.080 --> 25:03.120
Carf Fessner Corporation. He was a director of other

25:03.120 --> 25:07.200
multi-million dollar corporations from the Pullman Company to the Gillette

25:07.200 --> 25:11.440
Safety Razor Company. Incidentally this is the man small business

25:11.440 --> 25:16.160
men are supposed to look to for gardens. Heaven helped the small business man

25:16.160 --> 25:21.120
in a cabinet like this. And Marion P. Falson is Secretary of Health

25:21.120 --> 25:24.560
Education and Welfare. He was the treasure of the Eastman

25:24.560 --> 25:28.960
Kodak Company. Small wonder he opposed increased benefits for

25:28.960 --> 25:31.920
social security and for the age it in the last

25:31.920 --> 25:35.520
Congress. And Postmaster General Summerfield

25:35.520 --> 25:39.120
was one of the largest, if not the largest, automobile dealer in the state of

25:39.120 --> 25:43.760
Michigan. Even Secretary of State Dulles was a bank trustee and a senior

25:43.760 --> 25:46.720
member of one of the biggest Wall Street law firms.

25:46.720 --> 25:50.480
Navy Secretary Charles Thomas came to the cabinet after being

25:50.480 --> 25:55.360
director of such companies as Lockheed Aircraft. And therefore Secretary Quarrel

25:55.360 --> 25:59.440
was a high telephone official. There you have it, the Kedalak

26:00.400 --> 26:04.240
cabinet. Now I have nothing against the success of these men in business.

26:04.240 --> 26:08.240
They're not bad men. They are simply men with limited, very limited

26:08.240 --> 26:11.760
interest. But President Eisenhower says he represents

26:11.760 --> 26:16.080
all the American people. How can this administration do that?

26:16.080 --> 26:20.080
When nine out of twelve cabinet members are big, very big

26:20.080 --> 26:24.480
business men. I say this is class government. It doesn't represent

26:24.480 --> 26:28.960
Joe Smith. These men along with the Republicans in Congress

26:28.960 --> 26:33.760
have given us the highest cost of living and the highest interest rates

26:33.760 --> 26:37.040
and the highest percentage of small business failures

26:37.040 --> 26:40.080
in the history of this country for a long, long time.

26:40.080 --> 26:44.480
And no matter how you look at it, President Eisenhower is responsible.

26:44.480 --> 26:48.640
He is responsible for the promises he made in 1952

26:48.640 --> 26:53.680
and broke in 1956. He is responsible for the men around him.

26:53.680 --> 26:58.000
He appointed Ezra Tath Benson. He appointed the members of the National

26:58.000 --> 27:02.480
Labor Relations Board. He is actually proud of Richard Nixon.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.760
He is responsible for Wilson, Benson, and Dallas,

27:05.760 --> 27:11.120
for Humphrey, Adams, Pagrity, and Hall. About President Eisenhower's record that he

27:11.120 --> 27:15.120
didn't know his friends were breaking his promises,

27:15.120 --> 27:19.520
it reminds me of a cartoon by Herb Locke.

27:19.520 --> 27:24.080
This says they're trying to hold me responsible for my own

27:24.080 --> 27:29.280
administration. Well, we sure are Mr. President and the American people aren't.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.200
Yes, and you'll hear much from the Republicans in this campaign about how they

27:33.200 --> 27:37.440
are the party of the future. But we know who his future it is.

27:37.440 --> 27:41.840
And it's not Mr. Eisenhower's. It's Mr. Nixon's future.

27:41.840 --> 27:46.560
It is with Mr. Nixon that the Republican politicians will make their alliances

27:46.560 --> 27:53.760
and men their fences. Not with an elderly president who cannot run for re-election again.

27:54.240 --> 27:59.120
Do you want Richard Nixon in charge of the destiny of the American people?

27:59.120 --> 28:04.160
I don't think the American people want this kind of Republican leadership any longer.

28:04.160 --> 28:08.000
They want a new leadership for a new America.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.320
They want a new America with prosperity for all of our people,

28:12.320 --> 28:18.160
with equal opportunity for all. Adelaide Stevenson stands for that new America.

28:18.160 --> 28:22.240
And he speaks for the hopes and aspirations of all of our people.

28:22.240 --> 28:26.480
He is a man who means what he says and says what he means.

28:26.480 --> 28:30.080
And I'm proud to be his running mate. Think it over.

28:30.080 --> 28:34.880
Think it over, friends. And I'm hopeful that you will vote for us on election day.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.800
We offer you liberal, progressive government.

28:38.800 --> 28:44.160
We offer you a new leadership for a new and greater America.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.680
Thank you.

28:45.680 --> 28:57.280
Senator Kefawba would like to thank the many millions of you who today help to make dollars for Democrats Day a success.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.440
Every dollar collected will go to work immediately.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.040
Every dollar will help bring the true issues of the campaign before the public.

29:03.040 --> 29:06.560
Every dollar collected will help broadcast the Democratic message throughout the land.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.200
Those of you who have not yet shared in dollars for Democrats Day may still do so.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.520
Send your contributions directly to dollars for Democrats,

29:16.400 --> 29:22.400
Washington 6, DC. That's dollars for Democrats, Washington 6, DC.

29:29.360 --> 29:33.040
The preceding program has been presented by the Stevenson Kefawba campaign committee.

29:33.040 --> 29:44.000
Stay tuned for defunct theater on ABC television network.
