00:00.000 --> 00:26.360
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first in the CBS television series, Presidential

00:26.360 --> 00:32.040
Timber, appearing on this platform tonight, a candidate for the Democratic nomination

00:32.040 --> 00:38.200
for President, Senator Estes Kefover of Tennessee.

00:44.520 --> 00:52.680
But first, at first, the campaign song sung by Miss Trudy Adams, the Senator from Tennessee.

00:52.680 --> 01:01.960
There's a man that country is calling to preserve democracy.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.760
He's the man whose distance is lead us.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.560
He's the Senator from Tennessee.

01:07.560 --> 01:13.400
Estes Kefover's our selection for the US presidency.

01:13.400 --> 01:19.160
So let's give our approval to the Senator from Tennessee.

01:19.160 --> 01:24.920
All the Democrats in the nation is the one to nominate.

01:24.920 --> 01:28.280
Because he's won the most admiration.

01:28.280 --> 01:33.640
He's a man who really is great, where the Koon skinned Kef has a symbol.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.680
He's made friends with you and me.

01:36.680 --> 01:42.360
So let's give a lease on the White House to the Senator from Tennessee.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.560
Here's the Senator from Tennessee.

01:49.160 --> 02:00.520
Now I'd like you to meet the moderator of this series, the celebrated CBS television reporter, Robert Proud.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.520
Bob?

02:04.520 --> 02:05.720
Our greetings, greetings.

02:05.720 --> 02:10.440
Good evening and welcome to Presidential Timber, the television open house,

02:10.440 --> 02:15.720
which invites you all to meet the candidates in the method which the candidates themselves choose.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.720
And Presidential Timber welcomes as our first guest in this new series,

02:20.360 --> 02:23.480
the first declared candidate for the Democratic nomination,

02:23.480 --> 02:27.560
the victor and the primaries of New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Nebraska,

02:27.560 --> 02:31.960
the Democratic Senator from Tennessee, Senator Estes Kefover.

02:31.960 --> 02:45.640
On the platform with the Senator, his charming wife,

02:45.640 --> 02:57.640
Mrs. Estes Kefover and his father, Mr. RC Kefover.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.400
Senator Kefover went to Washington more than 13 years ago.

03:01.400 --> 03:06.120
It was back in 1939 that he first came to Washington as a representative from Tennessee,

03:06.120 --> 03:09.640
that is. And we reporters began to take him very seriously, indeed.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.800
We took a lot of serious notice when he started talking about reorganizing the government,

03:13.800 --> 03:18.520
streamlining Congress, bringing the old body up to date and making it easier, you know,

03:18.520 --> 03:23.400
for the legislative branch and the executive branch of the government to work together a little bit

03:23.400 --> 03:27.960
instead of fighting together a little bit. The Kuhnskin cap didn't enter the picture until somewhat

03:27.960 --> 03:34.120
later. In 1948, Representative Kefover went back to Tennessee to run for Senator against the

03:34.120 --> 03:39.560
powerful forces of boss Krump in Tennessee, in a campaign which began with practically everyone

03:39.560 --> 03:46.440
saying Estes Kefover just doesn't have a chance. When Representative Kefover invaded boss Krump's

03:46.440 --> 03:51.240
home grounds in Memphis, Krump published a full-page advertisement in every newspaper in the

03:51.240 --> 03:57.880
state of Tennessee saying Estes Kefover assumes the role of a pet coon. The answer came at a rally

03:57.880 --> 04:03.000
in Memphis when Representative Kefover put on a Kuhnskin cap and announced, proudly,

04:03.800 --> 04:09.960
I may have rings on my tail, but I do not have a ring through my nose and I am not boss Krump's pet

04:09.960 --> 04:21.080
coon. He won the election, of course. Now, in Washington, Senator Kefover is served on the Judiciary

04:21.080 --> 04:25.320
Committee on the Senate Armed Services Watchdog Committee, but the committee assigned what

04:25.320 --> 04:29.720
that brought his face and his voice into the American home just about everywhere was the

04:29.720 --> 04:36.280
chairmanship of the Senate Crime Investigating Committee. And now here, a recorded on film is one

04:36.280 --> 04:44.360
of the many dramatic moments of that crime committee hearing. I tell you, would you say whether or not

04:44.360 --> 04:51.960
you are familiar with the testimony given yesterday, I met the fanfist McLaughlin. I refused the answer

04:52.600 --> 04:56.520
to the question when there are probably times comes I would have plenty to say.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.160
Well, the chairman directs you to answer the question, Mr. Ristell.

05:02.120 --> 05:07.000
At this particular moment, I will not. What do you refuse to follow the direction of the chair?

05:07.000 --> 05:12.280
Absolutely. The chair directs you to answer the question and to answer such other questions as

05:12.280 --> 05:15.160
it will be asked this afternoon. I still refuse.

05:16.120 --> 05:24.440
And I think it's only fair to tell you that under those circumstances, I've just

05:24.440 --> 05:34.840
consulted with Senator Tulby, we will have to ask for your arrest by the United States Senate to

05:35.720 --> 05:41.720
bring you in to testify and we'll also have to ask for a contempt for seating against you.

05:42.040 --> 05:50.840
I want to tell you that right now, Mr. Woolf and Mr. Stello, what we expect to do. We don't expect to

05:54.280 --> 05:58.840
have a witness who appears here in very good physical condition,

06:00.200 --> 06:04.680
asking for an indefinite postponement for some time when the committee will be out of operation,

06:04.680 --> 06:07.720
when he's quite apparent that he's able to at least testify some.

06:07.880 --> 06:15.560
We'll co-operate with you if this voice gets badly, bad, we'll co-operate with you, but

06:16.840 --> 06:21.720
to have anybody tempted to fire the committee and the manner that Mr. Stello is trying to do,

06:22.920 --> 06:27.000
will you, as ever, resource in our command to see that he's brought to contempt and that he's

06:27.000 --> 06:34.120
arrested by the United States Senate. That's understood? I'm quite sure that we can understand that.

06:34.120 --> 06:39.640
You are in the situation, by the way. Yeah. How has the witness been served as subpoena?

06:39.640 --> 06:43.800
Yes. And you remain under subpoena, subject to further order of the committee.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.840
I'll be calling George White.

06:52.600 --> 06:57.400
Here in New York, right now, tonight, a jury is deliberating the case of Frank Castello,

06:57.400 --> 07:01.640
charged with contempt of the United States Senate as a result of the hearing we just saw.

07:02.440 --> 07:07.000
Our story moves to January of this year in Washington, D.C. when Senator Keyfauvers stood up

07:07.000 --> 07:13.960
at a microphone and made this announcement. I am a candidate for the Democratic nomination for

07:13.960 --> 07:15.560
President of the United States.

07:22.600 --> 07:29.400
Not a candidate for any other office. I'm going to work hard, very hard to win.

07:30.360 --> 07:37.240
And I am in until the finish. I regarded as the right of the American people to have as

07:37.240 --> 07:43.480
wide a choice as possible in selecting their leaders. There is a place and a great need

07:44.360 --> 07:47.160
for new blood and new ideas in both parties.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.760
Senator Keyfauvers was in the race and he meant to run a real race, but not everyone realized

07:52.760 --> 07:58.200
just how serious he was until he began that tour, traveling up and down the state of New Hampshire

07:58.200 --> 08:00.840
before the primary election three and a half weeks ago.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.480
Senator, how is the campaign going?

08:03.480 --> 08:08.120
Well, Mr. Gilbert, I think we are picking up strength all the time. I'm beginning to be very much

08:08.120 --> 08:13.480
encouraged about the outlook up here. We have traveled over the state pretty well in the last

08:13.480 --> 08:18.440
few days. And of course, we have some more days to go. The people have certainly been courteous.

08:18.440 --> 08:23.320
They've given us the hearing. They're interested very much in the problems of today.

08:24.120 --> 08:30.360
I find a great response to the ideas and issues that we have presented.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.760
So, particularly, it's encouraging me to see the young people, young men and women who are

08:36.760 --> 08:43.080
taking part in the active interest in our campaign. We haven't been a great campaign organization,

08:44.040 --> 08:47.880
but I always enjoy getting out and just talking with the people, as you know.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.080
And I find that they've been very receptive.

08:53.400 --> 08:58.920
Hi, boys, how are you all?

08:58.920 --> 09:01.960
What am I going to do? Sign this?

09:01.960 --> 09:05.080
Aren't these fine-looking boys and girls?

09:05.080 --> 09:07.720
I bet they're all Democrats, too.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.560
I can tell he's a Democrat.

09:11.560 --> 09:16.520
This is a Wisconsin coup, you're convicted to take a lot.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:17.720
To take it on.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.800
The original coup in town in Tennessee, the tail of just a part,

09:22.760 --> 09:23.720
and it doesn't come on.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.240
Well, we've seen just a little bit of that rugged tour.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.440
There a new hamster.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.320
And I'm sure the question has often come to all of us.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.560
What's it like to be a traveling candidate?

09:35.560 --> 09:38.040
And also, what's it like to be a traveling candidate's wife?

09:38.040 --> 09:41.720
And I'd like to ask Mrs. Kefoffer to step up and discuss it with us for a little bit.

09:41.720 --> 09:42.600
Mrs. Kefoffer, would you?

09:45.720 --> 09:46.680
That must be us.

09:46.680 --> 09:51.960
That must be pretty rugged, isn't it?

09:51.960 --> 09:53.080
Traveling around like that?

09:53.080 --> 09:53.720
Tell us about it.

09:53.720 --> 09:57.400
What are the problems of being a candidate's wife on an arduous trip like that?

09:58.360 --> 09:59.720
Well, there are plenty of problems.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.200
As you know, we travel pretty quickly.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.760
So you can imagine the sort of thing that happens to you.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.360
And you're going at that speed.

10:06.360 --> 10:11.160
Try to go to as many towns each day and see as many people as it's possible to see.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.440
It's the kind of vacation, isn't it?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.960
Maybe you're idea of a vacation.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.000
Lots of sleep and taking it easy, no?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.360
No, we find the days are very long and the nights are very short.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.240
You may catch up with you or you have troubles with that and all that stuff.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.520
Oh, we have the usual troubles.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.040
That are laundry problems, too.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.880
It might not be interested in that.

10:31.880 --> 10:32.680
Oh, I certainly am.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.880
Tell us about the laundry problem.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.520
Well, there are never any shorts when we need them.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.360
And we never know exactly where they are.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.480
Knowing my husband's pretty big man, you know?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.760
He needs a size 17 and 36 sleeve.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.120
It's awful.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.000
And the only thing we can find in the stores around seem to be

10:49.720 --> 10:52.680
small of a shirt and he's got a gulps and we do it like this,

10:52.680 --> 10:53.560
the button's pop.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.800
It's kind of bad.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.000
And it's always my fault.

10:58.840 --> 10:59.640
How about the children?

10:59.640 --> 11:01.560
They're too small to go along, aren't they?

11:01.560 --> 11:02.840
Oh, goodness yes.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.040
They couldn't keep up the speed and they just be a lot more trouble.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.560
They're pretty small anyway.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.200
They like to them.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.560
You tell the graph come on.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.960
Well, when we get in and time at night, we call them up.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.560
We don't get home on weekends.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.280
We always call them on Sundays and have a good chat with them.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.880
They're eager to talk to you.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.720
Recognize your voice and all that.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.360
Well, they're not half as eager as we are.

11:22.360 --> 11:26.040
Last Sunday I called and so thrilled to hear their voices.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.880
And they said, hurry up, mommy.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.000
We want to go to the zoo.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.760
Can't you talk to somebody else?

11:31.880 --> 11:34.360
Glad to see you when you get home at last, I bet.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.080
Well, the big ones were today, but it practically broke my heart.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.720
The baby didn't recognize me.

11:39.720 --> 11:40.120
Really?

11:41.080 --> 11:43.080
How long did it take before the baby was born?

11:43.080 --> 11:46.200
Well, I took all my hat and kind of rumbled up my hair and hope for the best.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.720
She still didn't recognize me.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.720
I see you're carrying a copy of Senator Kefover's book.

11:51.720 --> 11:56.200
A long tell me, is it worse being the wife of a traveling candidate than the wife of an author writing a book?

11:56.200 --> 11:56.840
Which is worse?

11:57.560 --> 12:00.280
Well, when he was writing this book, I thought that was the worst.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.200
Now I think I changed my mind a little bit.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.600
What kind of reception do you get?

12:04.600 --> 12:09.000
Everybody knows Senator Kefover now when you go out to small towns out in the country, don't they?

12:09.880 --> 12:12.920
Well, wherever television has been, they seem to know him pretty well.

12:12.920 --> 12:17.560
Particularly when I find that women always, they must have watched television a lot more than the man that,

12:17.560 --> 12:19.560
because they always seem to recognize him.

12:20.760 --> 12:21.800
I see the true man.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.800
You know, a lot of people want to know just how you pronounce your name, Mrs. Kefover.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.480
Would you go under that a little bit?

12:30.280 --> 12:33.880
Well, love, listen, and as to his father, he's 81 year old father's over here,

12:33.880 --> 12:35.560
and I think he could tell you a lot more about that.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.520
Well, fine, bring him up.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.120
I'm just asking for Sweden to come along.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.160
You can call him.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.720
Delighted to see you, sir.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.720
Tell us a little bit about how you pronounce this name now.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.720
Well, we call it Kefover.

12:53.720 --> 12:54.680
Kefover.

12:55.480 --> 13:00.520
Most any kind of pronunciation down south up north, I think they call it Kefover.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.080
As a matter of fact, we originated up here about

13:05.480 --> 13:11.800
Baltimore, my greatest south, after the Revolutionary War.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.880
Much southern people don't seem to have very much trouble with it.

13:17.080 --> 13:24.360
It seems to me like the Aggies in the Northern people ought to be pretty well used to the name.

13:24.360 --> 13:31.000
By now, there's been a pubs house enough, I think, and see it in print.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.400
They get acquainted with it, I guess.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.600
They spell it right off the road.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.760
Yeah, they spell it, it's a rule right now.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.600
Right about now.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.280
Now, did your son get interested in politics at a very early age,

13:42.280 --> 13:42.760
was to keep on going?

13:42.760 --> 13:45.960
Well, yes, he was always interested in things of that kind.

13:46.680 --> 13:51.320
He was always interested in any activities around the town,

13:51.320 --> 13:56.040
especially around the courthouse and trials and things of that kind.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.160
From Infancyway, he's always said that he was going to be a lawyer,

14:01.800 --> 14:04.360
and I think he's followed it up pretty well.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.720
Unless he's quitting the law business now, I just don't know.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.000
I'd like to have a look inside this photographic album,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.200
if you wouldn't mind, would you open it?

14:22.200 --> 14:22.840
Let's take a look.

14:22.840 --> 14:23.800
I'd like to see that.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.160
Oh, now tell us about this picture.

14:25.160 --> 14:30.200
Well, there's a picture there, a whole younger people over a family.

14:31.160 --> 14:35.800
My son and his lovely wife and his four children there, and these two dogs.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.920
That's what's the name of the dog's name?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.920
The Heidi and Barney.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.720
Oh, the dog.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.520
I see.

14:42.520 --> 14:49.640
Oh, there's a latest model of a rubber-tired cart

14:50.360 --> 14:54.920
with a Chetland pony, my wife and three children or two boys,

14:54.920 --> 14:56.280
and my oldest daughter.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.160
You look good in that.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.640
Yeah, I'm proud of that.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.400
Turn out, you know what?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.320
I thought that was the last word to a day.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.120
Oh, wait a minute.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.000
Wait a minute.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.840
And then when we came on, you know,

15:07.560 --> 15:09.560
after I got over the bus, it was good to eat.

15:09.560 --> 15:14.920
Why, we had put pretty good to a rather bulk this modern limousine.

15:14.920 --> 15:15.880
Oh, you see that?

15:16.600 --> 15:20.040
That was one of the Ford 19 and 809

15:21.640 --> 15:23.000
products, you know.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.280
Going all the fast, then.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.280
And we were going very fast then.

15:26.280 --> 15:29.240
We've 20 miles an hour of schedule and wife death, never.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.800
And also the mules and horses and might near all the people

15:33.800 --> 15:34.840
that we'd meet in the road.

15:35.960 --> 15:41.000
We went through quite a siege with that cart.

15:41.000 --> 15:41.800
I bet you did.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.480
I didn't think it'd go to the easy.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.240
It would be another man in rural county.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.280
He would begin a fool by one, but they seemed like it did.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.480
Yes, a few of them did that.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.680
Two of them did.

15:50.680 --> 15:51.640
I'll tell us about that.

15:51.640 --> 15:55.560
That's the madam and two boys.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.520
And this man's in my oldest daughter.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.320
This is Mr. Estor right here.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.080
He is starting out there on his lull.

16:07.000 --> 16:07.800
The degree.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.160
Well, the family's going up now, no?

16:09.160 --> 16:10.360
Yes, they're going up here.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.760
There's the boy and the two daughters.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.200
That's true.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.640
That's just wasn't in the Senate, was it?

16:15.640 --> 16:19.080
No, no, that little while before we got into the even the house.

16:19.080 --> 16:19.720
Oh, yes.

16:19.720 --> 16:23.960
Yeah, here he is out in there.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.800
It looks like in a hay-feeler picking grass or something.

16:27.880 --> 16:32.040
But evidently, that must be referring to his football leaves

16:32.040 --> 16:35.720
in which they call him a larns side down at the University of Tennessee.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.920
Yes, it was a story around that he was in the Old America.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.720
Well, I know.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.440
I'll just have to let him tell that.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.400
Yeah?

16:43.400 --> 16:45.160
If you're going to talk about my football,

16:46.120 --> 16:47.480
how many of you being in Old America now,

16:47.480 --> 16:49.320
I think I'd better get up and explain because...

16:49.320 --> 16:50.600
Yeah, I'll be fine.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.280
I'd like to have him cranked.

16:54.280 --> 16:54.920
Go right ahead.

16:58.360 --> 17:03.400
Well, Bob, the truth about that is that back in the 20s,

17:03.400 --> 17:05.240
when I attended the University of Tennessee,

17:05.240 --> 17:06.600
I did go out for football.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.240
And after a very strenious effort,

17:09.960 --> 17:11.320
I made the second team.

17:11.320 --> 17:14.040
They are always what is known as a bench warmer.

17:15.080 --> 17:18.440
When we had some easy game, I'd get to play in the last quarter.

17:19.400 --> 17:23.800
But as time went on in 1936, I ran for the State Senate,

17:23.800 --> 17:26.440
and I found that much to my surprise,

17:26.440 --> 17:29.800
that my campaign managers had picked me off the bench,

17:29.800 --> 17:32.440
and it put me on the first team as one of the best tackles

17:32.440 --> 17:34.680
the University of Tennessee had ever produced.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.480
Then in 1938, I ran for the House of Representatives,

17:39.480 --> 17:41.960
and I found that in that campaign,

17:41.960 --> 17:46.360
that my political managers had not only put me on the first team,

17:46.360 --> 17:49.480
but I had made the old Southern Conference team during that time.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.920
Then in 1948, our political platform had worked so well

17:54.920 --> 17:59.640
that I found that my political manager not only had me on the first team

17:59.640 --> 18:01.640
and an old Southern tackle,

18:01.640 --> 18:04.680
but during that campaign, I made the Walter Camps.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.880
First, all American is one of the best tackles I've ever had been.

18:09.320 --> 18:12.520
So that's the story of my football experience.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.960
Bob, am I supposed to make a talk now or what then?

18:17.960 --> 18:19.560
Yes, this is the time. You go right ahead.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.480
We'd like to hear what you have to say.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.280
I think you have something to say in addition to football, don't you, Senator?

18:25.160 --> 18:27.800
Yes, I would like Bob to say a few words.

18:27.800 --> 18:32.200
And I want to talk a little bit tonight about democracy.

18:33.080 --> 18:39.000
I think the cure for our yields is more democracy and not less democracy in this country.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.400
As ours is the government all far and by the people,

18:43.400 --> 18:46.200
it must function in terms of the people's understanding.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.920
There is no problem beyond the understanding of the people if they have the facts.

18:51.880 --> 18:56.840
It is therefore the duty of the government to tell the people frequently, conscientiously and

18:56.840 --> 19:00.040
clearly the facts on all questions of the day.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.800
Because I believe this and I believe it sincerely,

19:04.520 --> 19:09.960
I'm here tonight to tell you very briefly how I stand on some of the issues facing the American people.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.200
The greatest question of our time is of course peace.

19:15.240 --> 19:20.120
To achieve peace, we must be the vital leaders of the democratic nations of the world.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.080
And we cannot do this by talk alone.

19:23.960 --> 19:27.000
We must do it by building a firm democracy at home.

19:28.040 --> 19:33.320
Everything that I have done in my 14 years in the Congress has been designed to strengthen

19:33.960 --> 19:37.640
and vitalize democracy, both at home and in the world.

19:38.760 --> 19:43.400
I sincerely believe we can achieve peace if we keep our wits about us,

19:43.960 --> 19:48.840
if we do not give way to hysteria, and if we work together with goodwill.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.720
Anyone who undermines that goodwill by setting neighbor against neighbor,

19:53.720 --> 19:58.840
by innuendo, by vague charges, is an enemy of democracy.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.280
He is against everything that America stands for.

20:02.280 --> 20:06.200
Well, a lot of people have said this and have complained about it.

20:06.200 --> 20:10.520
As a member of the United States Senate, I have tried to do something about it.

20:10.520 --> 20:13.320
I have sponsored two resolutions.

20:13.320 --> 20:17.960
One of them is to set up a code of conduct for congressional committees.

20:18.920 --> 20:25.400
The other is to give any person the right to answer back if he is attacked on the floor of Congress,

20:25.400 --> 20:26.840
the right of self-defense.

20:27.960 --> 20:32.200
Democracy cannot function without an informed, intelligent citizen.

20:33.160 --> 20:37.800
In a democracy, it is the minds of all of the people that set the policies.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.640
At least that's the way it should be.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.840
A lot of people have said this too, but I've been trying to do something about it.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.280
As a member of both the House and later the Senate,

20:49.240 --> 20:54.360
I have sponsored a bill to establish a report and question period on the floor of Congress.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.920
During this time, the heads of the executive agencies would appear,

20:59.800 --> 21:02.440
explain their policies, what they have been doing,

21:03.240 --> 21:06.600
and members of Congress would have an opportunity of questioning them.

21:07.560 --> 21:12.920
This would establish better lia's on an understanding as a result of face-to-face discussions

21:12.920 --> 21:15.400
between Cabinet members and members of Congress.

21:16.680 --> 21:22.040
I also have proposed that these sessions should be covered by television, by radio, and by the press,

21:23.000 --> 21:29.080
so that the entire nation can look at and listen in at what we in government are doing.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.080
This would serve to keep the people more fully informed.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.000
Of course, it goes without saying that if we are going to have

21:37.800 --> 21:40.760
all the people participating in the decisions of government,

21:41.400 --> 21:43.160
we must have an educated people.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.280
This too, I have tried to do something about.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.800
I've tried to do it through federal aid for education,

21:50.520 --> 21:55.000
having sponsored bills for this purpose both in the House of Representatives

21:55.000 --> 21:56.040
and later in the Senate.

21:57.160 --> 22:01.080
If democracy is going to function, it must be a clean democracy.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.720
All of you know what was done by the Senate Crime Investigating Committee.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.720
The Crime Committee explores the corruption that existed.

22:10.520 --> 22:14.280
We also showed the social causes which produce corruption.

22:15.240 --> 22:19.080
We found them in the lack of opportunity for a good home life,

22:19.880 --> 22:23.640
the lack of an education, and the lack of economic security.

22:24.440 --> 22:28.120
We found them in the lack of recreational facilities for our children.

22:29.160 --> 22:33.240
Throughout my years in Congress, both in the House and in the United States Senate

22:33.240 --> 22:35.560
before the Crime Committee ever came into being,

22:36.520 --> 22:39.880
I supported legislation to sweep aside the slums

22:40.680 --> 22:42.520
and to replace them with homes,

22:43.240 --> 22:45.000
clean, and with life,

22:45.640 --> 22:49.880
and air and space surrounding them where children could play.

22:50.760 --> 22:57.000
I have always supported the great legislation to establish and to extend social security.

22:58.440 --> 23:01.160
As a member of Congress for the past 14 years,

23:01.960 --> 23:04.920
I've tried to do something about efficiency in government.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.120
I have sponsored reorganization plans.

23:09.080 --> 23:14.600
I have tried to arouse the people of the country to the need of these congressional reforms

23:15.560 --> 23:18.120
with my book, 20th Century Congress.

23:19.240 --> 23:23.640
A vital democracy must be conducted efficiently and economically.

23:24.840 --> 23:30.200
We are going to achieve great economies until we do something and settle this problem of peace.

23:31.160 --> 23:35.960
Because almost two-thirds of our federal budget goes to the greed of war.

23:36.920 --> 23:42.840
But even now, we can achieve some economies by cutting out waste in our military budget.

23:43.640 --> 23:47.640
And as a member of the so-called Senate Armed Services Watchdog Committee,

23:48.120 --> 23:50.200
I've been trying to do just that.

23:51.400 --> 23:57.000
The people's elected representatives should continue to exercise direct and full control

23:57.720 --> 24:00.600
over the expenditures of our federal establishments.

24:01.240 --> 24:06.600
To this end, I am supporting a proposal to give Congress adequate tools,

24:07.160 --> 24:09.400
adequate controls to deal with the budget.

24:10.280 --> 24:14.840
As budgets are now made, they are bound to contain much padding and much water.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.680
I would squeeze out all the water and get down to bedrock.

24:19.960 --> 24:25.240
All Americans can take pride and comfort in the economic and social gains that we have made during

24:25.400 --> 24:28.840
the last 20 years under democratic administrations.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.320
These have made us stronger.

24:31.960 --> 24:36.280
But we have a long way to go before we achieve the standards of education,

24:37.000 --> 24:41.320
health, housing, social security, resource development,

24:41.880 --> 24:47.480
and equality of opportunity to which the people of this most productive country in the world

24:48.040 --> 24:49.240
are surely entitled.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.280
And here I'm talking about all of the people,

24:52.840 --> 24:57.080
women and men, the poor and the rich, city folks and farmers.

24:57.800 --> 25:01.720
And as my friend Nathan Strauss has said in his little, good little book,

25:02.440 --> 25:05.480
the descendants of those who crossed on slave ships,

25:06.280 --> 25:09.800
as well as the areas of those who came over on the Mayflower.

25:10.760 --> 25:15.560
The task before us is formidable, but there is every reason for hope.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.040
This country has never failed.

25:18.840 --> 25:23.640
We must rekindle our faith in ourselves and our free and democratic way of life.

25:24.760 --> 25:30.120
We need a new dedication to the liberal and progressive principles upon which this nation was founded.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.720
We need new zeal for honor and for virtue.

25:34.680 --> 25:41.080
All of us need more of the enthusiasm, the imagination and the idealism of America in its youth.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.240
America has emerged from isolation and grown great.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.000
They accepted and respected leader of the free world

25:49.720 --> 25:51.880
under the leadership of the Democratic Party.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.680
And we cannot turn back the clocks.

25:55.640 --> 26:00.600
It is my firm belief that we shall go farmer to higher goals under the Democratic Party.

26:01.480 --> 26:07.080
The Democratic Party is endeavoring earnestly to vindicate the high purposes and the noble

26:07.080 --> 26:14.280
principles of our constitution, liberty and opportunity and equality for all.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.680
That is what I stand for.

26:18.280 --> 26:22.840
That is what I have the hope of the honor of leading our party to victory

26:23.560 --> 26:25.960
in the pursuit of these goals this year.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.280
I hope that you will support me.

26:29.080 --> 26:33.160
And now ladies and gentlemen are there any questions that any of you wish to ask.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.880
You have a question, sir?

26:47.880 --> 26:48.680
Yes.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.560
Are your name please?

26:49.560 --> 26:50.760
Joseph McCleen.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.040
And your occupation, Mr. McCleen.

26:52.040 --> 26:52.600
Attorney.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.560
Now what's your question?

26:53.560 --> 26:58.600
Senator of vital interest to me in this county campaign is a civil rights issue.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.680
Just how do you stand on civil rights?

27:00.680 --> 27:06.520
Mr. McLean, all of my life I wanted to better relationships between people of all racist classes and creeds.

27:07.400 --> 27:13.240
I don't want anybody's opportunity in the United States penalized or limited because of their race color or

27:13.240 --> 27:15.880
creed or where their ancestors came from.

27:16.840 --> 27:20.760
I fought against the poll tax bill when I first came to the House.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.200
I want us to have fair employment practices.

27:25.160 --> 27:29.880
My personal conviction is that we will get more on a voluntary educational

27:30.520 --> 27:33.400
for a swaisy basis than we will by legislative five.

27:33.960 --> 27:39.480
But that is a matter I think for the Democratic National Committee and for the states to decide

27:39.560 --> 27:41.720
the National Committee has for the Democratic Party.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.960
But in any event I do not believe as a matter of principle in the filibuster.

27:46.680 --> 27:50.680
I want the issue determined on its merits in the floor of the House.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.440
And I'm going to support the position of the Democratic Party in that matter.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.600
One more question.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.560
Do you have a question, sir?

28:01.560 --> 28:02.360
Yes, I do.

28:02.360 --> 28:02.600
I'm John Adam.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.400
Decemone.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.440
And your other relations.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.960
Senator, like most veterans, I'm interested in peace.

28:08.920 --> 28:15.080
Would you meet Stalin anywhere in the world or except Washington in the interest of security?

28:15.080 --> 28:19.640
Well, sir, I think if there is a reasonable hope for working out a piece,

28:19.640 --> 28:23.960
a settlement of the difficulty with the communists so that we can have peace,

28:24.600 --> 28:27.480
I don't think anybody ought to stand on their honor.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.840
I mean, on their dignity, I think we ought to do everything possible.

28:31.640 --> 28:35.880
But we don't want to have a, I wouldn't want to have a conference with Stalin or anybody else

28:35.880 --> 28:39.240
if we're just going to lead us into another trap or a bad situation.

28:40.120 --> 28:44.120
I think if after this condition were surveyed through the United Nations,

28:44.120 --> 28:49.560
that there were reasonable guarantees that anything agreed upon would be carried out.

28:50.120 --> 28:53.080
But then of course, we ought to have any conferences that we could have.

28:53.800 --> 28:59.080
But I think that the iron curtain is going to have to come down before we're going to get very far in that direction.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.280
And I'll look over and say you probably want to talk about the iron curtain.

29:02.280 --> 29:06.680
Senator, it's time to ring down the curtain on this first edition of Presidential Timber in 1952 series.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.440
See you all the same time next week. Good night.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.040
This is the first and the CDS television series,

29:18.040 --> 29:21.320
Presidential Pimper, a nice guest for Senator Estes Keephoff,

29:21.320 --> 29:24.040
our candidate for the Democratic nomination for president.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.080
Next week Robert Krop will have his guest, Governor Earl Warren of California,

29:29.080 --> 29:31.800
candidate for the Republican nomination for president.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.960
This is the CBS television network.
