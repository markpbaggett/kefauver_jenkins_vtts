00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the gentleman sitting with me here, Senator John Carroll, who is

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
in the color of the month.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Mr. Carroll and I served together for many years and the council representatives now return

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
together in the Senate.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Senator Carroll was the first member of the Interior Committee.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
And as a member of that committee, he is sitting where, joining in, the discussions of the

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
chairman of the committee, which I am sure, in consideration of the rapid-passed number

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
of decisions right off, especially private utilities, such as Senator Carroll.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Senator Carroll is the real expert on this stuff, and I'm going to ask him generally,

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
though he thinks about it as a different information on this very important and effective

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
matter.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
On the center of the key form, well, of course, I do not profess to be an expert, but I indeed

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
privilege to have been called in to serve with you and to watch the distinguished senator

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
from Tennessee work on these witnesses.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I mean, he works on them.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
He draws information out of them.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
They try to hide it for them, and he is an expert in his field drawing information out

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
of these experts.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Then a privilege for me to be associated with you in this focus.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, thank you, John.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
The rapid-passed right off is supposed to be an incentive to industry to build something

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
for a sense of localization purpose, which they would not otherwise build.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
But we find that they are being granted these right off whether they need them or not,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
whether they are permanent improvements, whether they are even only an offer.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
That's the purpose.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
Senator Carroll, I believe Mr. Secretary Optree said that this is cost of the federal government

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
and $3.5 billion of the state's budget rate.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
$3.5 billion out of the treasury of the United States government?

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, of course, we had to stop the gander against the EVA.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
You had to decide that it's a scam that the health canyon was being built

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
without cost of the federal government.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
What has developed in connection with health canyon is the best deal you've ever been.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
I think if the people of Tennessee could really understand what has been happening,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
they would be in revenge.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
I think if I may, in a very brief period of time that we have here,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
if I may sketch this.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Not long ago, the Idaho Power Company went before the federal power commission

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
to obtain a license to build from debt.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Great Colibor, national debt.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
They won that price.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
It was a very valuable benefit it was given to us.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
We think that there was political manipulation in the granting of that license,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
now what is the situation to take?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Not worth standing in the receipt of that great benefit.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
They are now given the great tax rainfall of about $65 million.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Again, we contend that there's political manipulation.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And I want to say to you, Senator, that's the key forer that have not been for you,

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
that Senator Burd and other senators would have been misled

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
as to the importance of what has been going on.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
For example, the Secretary of Interior Secretary Xi, rejected this proposal.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
He recommended against this proposal,

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
but only Senator Xi forward was able to get his finger on the seat letter,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
because we were led to believe that Xi can had approved.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
And I commend you, Senator Xi, for the fine work that you've done.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, John, Senator Xi forward to pass on these power matters,

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
but he rejected it, but he has his rejections with overrule

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
and they granted him an article of Taracan's service as an outstanding.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
But I think it ought to be pointed out also, didn't they,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
article of Taracan for people's claims and states that it's not one cost of federal government,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
one time and one time?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
It's exactly what they said before the federal power commission.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
If you just punish this crisis, it will not cost the people of the United States

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
one thing, actually it's going to cost us millions of dollars before we're too late.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Otherwise, they get the right office, that's what it's about.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It's about 50 years old, maybe.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, Senator Carol, this whole thing revolved around matters

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
whether they were rather the rat-effects right office, essentially, but not.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And hasn't the federal issue that they've been stranding them,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
even though it's nothing to do much as they're doing,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
anyway, still much, anyway.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
No question about that.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Well, I certainly do thank you, Senator Carol,

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
and I sometimes feel kind of saddened with the rest of the discussion

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
as well as these little tellers.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
That's all for now, and thanks for that.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee,

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
progress was made on the TBA Self-Financing Bill again this week.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
In the House, the Public Works Committee reported the bill

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
sponsored by Representative Tucker Davis, Tennessee,

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
and supported by all of our Tennessee Valley Congress.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
The bill now goes before the rules, Committee,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
and I'm optimistic that this committee will give the TBA bill

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
its they on the floor of the House.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
As you know, the Senate's public works committee has already reported

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
about two weeks ago the TBA Self-Financing Bill

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
with some necessary compromise.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
And Senator Lyndon Johnson of Texas, the leader of the majority in the Senate,

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
included this bill in his list of examples of emergency legislation

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
that had to be passed in this session.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
And he hopes the Senate will consider it right after the civil rights bill,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
which is occupying all of the time the Senate has proposed on.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Under these conditions, I am again hopeful that we can enact a fair

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
and equitable means of financing the TBA facilities

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
before this session of Congress adjourned.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I need not tell you how important it is to do that.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
You know, or you know that during the last four years,

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
we have had no appropriations for any new power and capacity

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
like steam plants or hydroelectric facilities for the TBA.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And just before coming into the studio,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
I talked to Congressman Joe Evans of the Appropriations Committee,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
and he said that no money for this purpose was included in the

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Appropriation Bill for next year.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, this week the Senate, after voting,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
to take off the civil rights bill,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
continued searching the bait and analysis of this measure.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
The Senate is proceeding on the same high level

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
that I spoke of last week on this program.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I think that the bait has been extremely good,

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
and has brought the light areas for clarification and change, or necessary.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
One of these areas is the necessity of guaranteeing trial,

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
by jury and contempt cases, arising under this bill.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
This has been a not illegal problem in connection with this legislation.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And this week after studying the matter of great deal,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I presented an amendment which I believe offers success solution

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
that's been intended yet.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
My amendment makes the distinction between civil and criminal contempt actions.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
The distinction actually is the purpose of the judge,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
inciting a defendant for contempt.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
What is his purpose?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
If he is trying to put into effect,

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
if his decrees is on decrees of his court,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
if so, then that action is civil and nature.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Is he trying to punish an offender for plotting his decrees?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
If so, his action is criminal and nature.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Everyone agrees, I believe, that this trick judge

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
should have the authority to enforce his own decrees.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
In doing so, a violator may be fined,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
or it may be incarcerated,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
but he's a violator who holds the key, so to speak, in his own hands.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
As soon as he complies, he is released,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
and he's purged of all contempt.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
On the other hand, if the judge says that you have violated my order,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
and I'm going to punish or put you in jail

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
if we find that you have violated it,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
for some specified time,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
then the purpose of the judge is punitive and nature,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
and the defendant is certainly entitled

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
to a right to a trial by a jury of his views.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I think we've fought too long to the right

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
to a jury trial to give it up now.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
And the second amendment that I filed

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
was the commission itself.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Under President Eisenhower's bill,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
it is a presidential commission,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
filled by appointment of the President

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
and reporting to the President.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
And yet, all of the duties of the commission,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
however, are legislated in nature.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
But my amendment would make this a legislative commission,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
for the vice President and Speaker of the House

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
each naming one member, and the majority,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
and minority leaders of the Senate,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
and House each naming one, or a total of six.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
This issue, this general issue of civil rights,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
has been a national political football too long.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I think it should be seven.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I do not think of either of these proposals

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
that I've spoken of as cover-man.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
I present them because I believe they are right.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
If we keep in mind what we are trying to do,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
that is to assure every person a right to vote,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and try to work out a bill which will do that,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
without giving away some of our other rights,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
such as that of a filed by jury.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And I think we will have performed a good

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
and legitimate purpose.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Our own purpose will be to try to arrive

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
at an equitable settlement of this issue.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
It has remained too long as a political football,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
and has been too long a divisive issue among our people.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
That's all for now, until next week,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
this time. Goodbye and thank you.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
friends of Tennessee,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
during this week hearings began in the Senate

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
on the proposal to grant the Tennessee Valley authority

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
a means of financing its own necessary expansion.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
For our region of the country,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
there is no more important piece of legislation

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
pending in this context than this TVA self-financing bill.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
It is a must for this session.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
There are two basic bills being considered

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
by the Senate Public Works Subcommittee.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
One is the so-called Curb Bill,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
sponsored by Senator Robert S. Curve,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Oklahoma, the Subcommittee Chairman.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Senators Eastland, Senators,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Hill, Sparksman, and Gore,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and Senator Gore is the member of the Subcommittee.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And I have joined the Senator Curve

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
in the sponsorship of this bill.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
The other is the Bill sponsored by Senator John Sherman Cooper

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
of Kentucky.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
It seems obvious to me,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
from the questions asked by the committee members,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
on the day that Senator Hill's Sparksman Cooper

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
and I testified before the Public Works Subcommittee

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
this past week,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
that there will be several issues which we must face both

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
in the Valley and in the nation,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
in connection with working out this legislation.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
First, perhaps, is the matter of area limitation.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
The cup of bill has a rather well-defined area limitation.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
That territory being served at a TVA

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
as a February of this year,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
including its exchange of electricity agreements.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Senator Cooper explains that under his bill,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
it would take an act of Congress

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
to make any extension of TVA service.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Under the bill which we sponsored,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
there is no limitation other than that

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
defined in the basic TVA act,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
which is the economical transmission distance

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
from the hydroelectric dam.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
We prefer not to be any more specific in that.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
TVA's long history shows that it is not a radar

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
of surrounding territory.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
This problem is to get enough power

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
to serve its own region,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
not try to expand into adjacent region.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
But the near fact that it is not prohibited

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
from serving cooperatives or the municipalities

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
across the road,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
is what has made the yardstick work so well

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
and effectively during the past year.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
If you will look at a map,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
you see that the amount of rates

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
extending around a TVA territory,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
are higher, the further away you have got from the TVA.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
First, by these companies,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
have low rates and sell more electricity

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
and then make more money

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
than the private power companies

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
that great distance from the TVA.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Of course, the tendency itself is not effective

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
because it is all in the TVA area.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
But out there, there will be a change

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
in this picture for surrounding states.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
If we lay down a hard and fast boundary,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
another issue will be the extent of treasury control.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Under our bill, the TVA board is definitely in control

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
and it may consult with the treasury

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
regarding the issuance of bonds.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Under the Cooper bill,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
it must consult with the second care of the treasury

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
and the treasury has the right to halt the issuance of bonds

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
for not more than 90 days.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Finally, there is the amount of bonds issued

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
and their repayment.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Senator Cooper would limit the issuance to $750 million

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
without further congressional authorization.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
We would not face a figure limitation in the bill

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
because since these are revenue bonds,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
the amount with the effectively limited

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
of what the system can absorb.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And as for repayment, of course,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
all of these bonds are going to have to be repaid by interest,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
with interest.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
But we think it's a mistake to require the amortization

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
of paying back of the original investment within 40 years

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
and to require payment of interest also,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
which is what the Cooper bill can do.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
This would, of course, make the electric rates higher in the valley

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
and it would tend to do away with the TVA yardstick,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
which we don't want done.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
It would be overly burdensome on the system.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And if a far heavier financial burden

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
and any private utility system is required to bear it,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
generally speaking, I thought the numbers of the public

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
work subcommittee, even those who are not considered particularly friendly

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
to the TVA, showed a rather reasonable attitude

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
in trying to work out in good faith

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
to give us the privilege of financing our own necessary power expansion.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm hopeful for a reasonable bill out of the committee.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Much, of course, depends on just how antagonistic the budget bureau

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
and the administration proved to be.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Basic to all, and the big decision to be decided here,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
is whether we are willing to trust the TVA board

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
located in the region and working with the people

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
to operate the TVA, or whether we will allow

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Washington's and the Rockles' efforts its way into the driver's seat.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Thank you and good-bye until next week.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very remarkable world we're living in today.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
It was recently announced that an Earth satellite

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
will be launched in Florida this fall or early next winter

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
as a part of our nation's participation

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
in the International Geophysical Year.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
This object is an exact model of the sphere as it will be launched

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
by a three-stage rocket near the East Coast of Florida.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
It is expected to attain an altitude of 300 miles above the Earth's surface

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
after being launched into its orbit

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
at a 35-degree inclination to the equator.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
This sphere, when it enters orbit, will resemble a very faint star.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
It will be visible to the naked eye, but only briefly in the twilight hour.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
Inside this globe or sphere is a complete radio transmitter

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
capable of sending a wealth of scientific data

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
back to scientists who will receive and translate it.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
One of the important projects in connection with this

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
is to determine the exact shape of the Earth.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
This 20-inch sphere, which weighs 21 and a half pounds,

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
will be traveling at the rate of 18,000 miles per hour

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
and will go around the Earth once every hour and a half.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
You will be hearing a whole lot about this project in the months to come,

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
so I'm glad to have the opportunity of showing you exact models

16:07.000 --> 16:15.000
or exact spheres, which will be a part of this performance and demonstration.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee,

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
these parchment papers are a facsimile of the Constitution.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Just as it was written by the Committee on Style in the Constitutional Convention,

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
in Article 2, Section 1 of this document are these words,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
filling vacancy in the office of the President,

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
in case of a removal of the President from office or of his death,

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the Set Office,

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
the same shall devolve on the Vice President.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Around this phrase, and what it says and what it does not say,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
will revolve a new and fascinating constitutional debate.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
As chairman of the Constitutional Revision Subcommittee,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
I shall have to play a role in this study.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Therefore, I should like to discuss it with you today.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
You will note that these words leave some highly important questions on answer.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
In the case of the death or resignation of the President, there is no question.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
But who is to determine inability to discharge the powers and duties of office?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
What if the inability is only temporary?

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
How can the presidential powers be surrendered temporarily and then re-assume?

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
These questions have been extremely pertinent three times in the history of our nation.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
This is a picture of James Garfield, the 20th President of the United States.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
A similar phrase assassin shot President Garfield on July 21, 1881.

17:56.000 --> 18:03.000
He laid desperately ill much of the time in coma until his death in September on September 19 of that year.

18:03.000 --> 18:10.000
During Garfield's illness, the public business was neglected and our foreign relations took a turn for the works.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
But the nation safe then behind its ocean struttle fruit.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
At one time, the cabinet decided the thing to do would be to make vice president author,

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
acting president. But they decided against this because they feared that after Garfield's hope for recovery,

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
there would be no way for him to legally re-assume the office.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
Here now is a picture of Woodrow Wilson, the 27th President of the United States.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
In the late summer of 1919, President Wilson already warned down by the battle for the League of Nations,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
decided to take his issues with the people.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
Gradually, he set out on a punishing nationwide speaking tool.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
In the early morning hours of September 26, his body less strong than his will broke down.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
He suffered a paralyzing stroke. Wilson eventually recovered, but for months,

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
he laid two ills to perform any duties. He did not meet part with his cabinet for eight months.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
While he lay helpless the Senate through the actions of the famous little band of willful men,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
he killed the United States entry into the League of Nations.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
We can only speculate that if there had been a method of carrying on the executive duties of the government,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
the League might have been ratified.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
We can only speculate that with the United States in the League of Nations,

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
it might have been strong enough to avert World War II.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
All of us remember vividly the last time that this problem arose

19:37.000 --> 19:43.000
when President Eisenhower was stricken with a heart attack and lay helpless for several weeks.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
We are all grateful as the prayers of the people of the nation were answered,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
and he recovered to resume his duties.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
And we are glad that he has taken the lead in frankly facing this very important problem.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Several suggestions have been made for solving this problem.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
One is that the cabinet should be empowered to make these determinations.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
This has been criticized on the grounds that they are interested parties.

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
They all owe their appointment to the President and might not continue in office under a new president.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
Another is that the Supreme Court are a combination of the cabinet and the chief judge make these determinations.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
This too has been criticized on the ground that it involved the judiciary,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
a separate branch of government where it should not be involved.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
It has been suggested that Congress, which has the impeachment power,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
should also have this power.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Perhaps by a two-thirds vote should Congress prepare the test and disable,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
and then by a majority vote should he recover,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
declaring him able to resume his power.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It is a vitally important question,

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
one on which the fate of this nation could someday turn.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Now, this is a picture of signing of the Constitution.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
These men didn't leave many questions unanswered.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
It may be up to us to supply the answer to one of these questions that they did leave unanswered.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
I hope that you too will be given giving this your thought,

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
and that you will let me know what you think about the various proposals that have been made.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Thank you, and goodbye until next week.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee,

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
I try on these programs to bring before you and to have as our guest some of the leading people in the nation

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
and in the United States Senate from time to time,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
and also to try to keep our programs on a nonpartisan basis,

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
bringing in some democratic senators and leaders,

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
and also some of our outstanding Republican leaders.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
On the program last week, we had this thing with Senator from Alabama,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Senator Spartman, who gave us some news.

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
And today we have one of the great and outstanding men in the United States Senate,

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
who is highly respected, whether you agree with him or not, his word is always his bond,

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
and he is highly thought of by not only Republican senators,

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
but by democratic senators as well.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
I don't think that I need to call our friends name.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
You've all seen him on television.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
I find outstanding men, but in case any of you do not know who our guest is,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
the senator will give no one a telephone you,

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
the leader of the Republicans in the United States Senate.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
We certainly are glad to have you on this program bill.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Well, I'm certainly glad to be on the program with you, Estus, and do,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
meet with our very fine people of Tennessee.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
I've had the privilege of being in your state on a number of occasions

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
and hope to get back again before too long.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
I know you have, and we always welcome you, and we want you there.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
Now, of course, the logical question to ask Senator Novan would be,

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
Senator Novan is not running for re-election to the United States Senate in 1958.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
He is retiring from the Senate.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
I'm not going to let you say what your future plans are.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
I know you wouldn't tell me anyway, but I do want you to know, ladies and gentlemen,

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
that you'll probably be seeing and hearing about Senator Novan in half places in public life

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
for many, many years to come.

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
But now, Senator Novan, one of the most important matters we have in Tennessee

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
and in the Tennessee Valley is trying to have a satisfactory self-financing program

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
whereby by the TVA, you can get sufficient money to continue its operations

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
and to build necessary steam plants or hydroelectric facilities to serve people of the valley.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
I remember when you first came to the Senate on your own,

23:47.000 --> 23:54.000
you went down and saw the TVA and came back, and you've always spoken well of the TVA.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
What is your feeling about a program at this time and about TVA?

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
Senator, I have been, of course, very favorably impressed with the developments that took place

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
in the Greek Tennessee Valley area.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
I've always gone on the belief that what benefits one section of our country benefits

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
in the entire nation, I certainly want to see adequate financing provided

24:19.000 --> 24:27.000
so that the growth and development of the Greek Valley of the Tennessee and the service area there

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
may move ahead, then that they will have adequate power resources to take care of the growing economy.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Now, just what the details should properly be, I'm not prepared to say at this time,

24:38.000 --> 24:46.000
but certainly nothing you should pull back the growth and development of the economy of your great area.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Well, I was a very encouraging word, and I know that you mean everywhere you say it, Bill,

24:50.000 --> 25:01.000
and we do appreciate your help in labeling us to try to get some system whereby we can continue to have the TVA as a great agency.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
I wish we could go on here for a long time, but you're a member of the Foreign Relations Committee

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
and very interested in foreign affairs.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
The situation in the Middle East is troublesome to all of us.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Do you have any late news or ideas you can tell us about it?

25:16.000 --> 25:25.000
Of course, the developments in the last few days brought news that the American Six Fleet was moving from France

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
over into the adjacent waters to the mid-eens.

25:29.000 --> 25:39.000
Currently, have been efforts on the part of the Egyptian radios and some of the communist-dominated propaganda agencies

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
to stir up trouble in Jordan.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
It appears to be very serious at the present time.

25:45.000 --> 25:52.000
We hope that it will not lead, however, to any outbreak of hostilities in that part of the world.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
Bill, on behalf of the viewers of this station, I want to thank you very much for being on the program with me.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
We will be looking forward to your down-end development here in the state because we know that you are our friend and we are friends of yours.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I'm very happy to have been here with you.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Thank you very much.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
.
