00:30.000 --> 00:43.240
Senator Kefawber, Chairman of the Committee, prefaces the New Israel Camera Report with

00:43.240 --> 00:45.560
an outline of the Investigation's aim.

00:45.560 --> 00:52.200
The aims of the special committee of the United States Senate to investigate organized crime,

00:52.200 --> 00:58.160
which is composed of Senator O'Connor of Maryland, Hunter Wyoming, Toby of New Hampshire,

00:58.160 --> 01:03.460
and the WILE of Wisconsin and myself are that we have been hearing for a long time that

01:03.460 --> 01:09.160
they are well organized and well financed groups of racketeers and gangsters operating

01:09.160 --> 01:16.200
in the United States across state lines as a centric or as a group of centric.

01:16.200 --> 01:21.240
The aims of our committee are to find out if this is true, whether the facilities of interstate

01:21.240 --> 01:28.560
commerce are being used by racketeers on a nationwide basis and violation of state laws,

01:28.560 --> 01:35.040
how they do it, the means that they accomplish their purposes, and we are also interested

01:35.040 --> 01:41.200
in finding out the connection between crime and politics, that is what protection these

01:41.200 --> 01:45.560
organized gangsters have in their operations.

01:45.560 --> 01:50.520
Of course, the ultimate and the fundamental aim of our committee as in any investigating

01:50.520 --> 01:57.920
committee is to get the picture in order to recommend federal legislation to the Senate

01:57.920 --> 02:00.840
and to the United States Congress.

02:00.840 --> 02:08.000
An incidental byproduct or aim of our committee is to turn the spotlight of publicity and

02:08.000 --> 02:13.760
public information on these operators so that the local people will become aroused and

02:13.760 --> 02:16.800
do something about it themselves.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.600
Sitting in New York's federal building for one of its final hearings, the committee

02:20.600 --> 02:25.680
became a dramatic tribunal showing a democracy about the business of cleaning house, even

02:25.680 --> 02:31.120
though the shocking conditions it uncovered were made at the expense of the nation's pride.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.000
Before coming to New York, it had conducted inquiries in many other communities, but it

02:35.000 --> 02:39.440
wasn't until it started crying into big town corruption that it became the nation's number

02:39.440 --> 02:41.000
one sensation.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.320
George Martin Levy, executive of a harness racing track, was an early witness, testifying

02:46.320 --> 02:52.320
about a deal he made with Frank Costello to have bookmakers removed from the track.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.840
Costello was to follow him as a witness.

02:54.840 --> 03:01.760
If you were not to say they must have died, you must have disbelieved Frank Costello

03:01.760 --> 03:06.920
and he said he had no association with bookmakers and didn't know that Mr. Howard, I made the

03:06.920 --> 03:10.360
statement that he had the reputation of being influential with gamblers.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.000
I still say the same thing.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.480
That statement was definitely true.

03:13.480 --> 03:17.000
It's a jar of opinion that he would come to want to work gambling.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.600
Well, that's a very hard thing, Dan, because I don't know.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.840
I only know basically if the newspaper reports the right where he must have influence with

03:24.840 --> 03:25.840
it.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.280
If they're not accurate, you're asking me for the operation of a metal condition.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.040
Well, here's the man you knew very well.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.640
You're close friend, is that not right?

03:34.640 --> 03:36.120
You're not a close friend, Dan.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.440
Well, you're golfing companions?

03:37.440 --> 03:38.920
Yes, on money occasions.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.520
And the man, both two very often.

03:41.520 --> 03:45.920
Well, on the golf courses and a few other times in between, yes.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.840
And how did you think Costello was going to do the job?

03:48.840 --> 03:50.160
Wasn't what I thought.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.480
It's how he thought.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.040
You don't reach up in the air for somebody else, there's a confidence in them, do you?

03:55.040 --> 03:57.760
Listen, Senator, who wasn't what I thought?

03:57.760 --> 03:59.520
I didn't think they were there to begin with.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.680
It's what the commission of thought.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.280
You thought so to the extent of $60,000 of your own money.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.280
I did nothing of the kind.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.120
You put $60,000 in, didn't you?

04:07.120 --> 04:08.840
I've explained time and time again.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.840
Why I paid $60,000 down.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.720
I'll leave it to any family at first.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.440
Well, I respect your remarks.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.360
When you're going to be the health reasons over there, why?

04:16.360 --> 04:18.520
I like to know what you think it was done for then.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.880
And I'd like to have the opportunity to perform.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.280
I'd love to have the opportunity to make about the whole thing.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.520
I think any family at first needs to.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.440
I'd like to have it.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.800
I'd really like to have you express your idea of what you think it was for,

04:29.800 --> 04:31.640
and give me an opportunity to reply.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.120
That's what I will for you, get through.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.840
I'd be very happy.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.600
A jailer blingingly allowed this witness to appear.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.040
He is Frank Erickson, who's serving a two-year sentence

04:41.040 --> 04:44.200
after pleading guilty to a 60-count gambling conspiracy

04:44.200 --> 04:46.040
information charge.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.320
Before his jailing, the 54-year-old bookmaker

04:48.320 --> 04:50.600
admitted to handling a multi-million-dollar yearly

04:50.600 --> 04:53.040
gross in unlawful betting.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.920
This is his second appearance before the committee,

04:54.920 --> 04:56.400
and he attributes his present plight

04:56.400 --> 04:58.360
to his earlier testimony before it.

04:58.360 --> 05:01.120
So now flanked by his lawyer, Harold Corbin,

05:01.120 --> 05:03.760
he stands on his constitutional rights

05:03.760 --> 05:06.280
and refuses to answer questions put to him

05:06.280 --> 05:10.120
by the committee's effective chief counsel, Rudolf Halley.

05:16.120 --> 05:16.960
What is your business?

05:24.320 --> 05:25.520
We can't hear you, Mr. Harold.

05:28.440 --> 05:32.000
My business, I'm no business, I'm in jail.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.720
What was your business prior to being convicted?

05:36.720 --> 05:39.000
I was a high judge on the crack on the grounds

05:39.000 --> 05:41.040
of my company.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.360
Were you a bookmaker?

05:42.360 --> 05:43.440
I refused.

05:43.440 --> 05:47.600
Fuse the insonic grounds of my tenement promenade.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.080
The Erickson will update any legitimate occupation,

05:51.080 --> 05:54.160
which you ever thought that the paid it.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.200
I refused the insonic grounds of my tenement promenade.

05:58.200 --> 06:01.720
If it's not a fact that the colonial in,

06:01.720 --> 06:06.720
by the gambling operation, I refused the insonic grounds of my tenement.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.480
Why you have recommended these questions, Mr. Erickson?

06:11.480 --> 06:13.560
There you have chair orders, you'd answer the question.

06:13.560 --> 06:17.640
I refused the insonic grounds of my tenement promenade.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.160
Mr. Erickson, the senator to Keith Harbor.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.880
Castello, speak to you about keeping the bookies away

06:22.880 --> 06:27.240
from Roosevelt Raceway.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.680
I don't recall.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.800
Did Erick talk with you about the bookie problem out there?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.280
I don't recall.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.520
What would you remember if he had?

06:35.520 --> 06:38.280
I don't remember.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.400
As I said, the senator told me,

06:40.400 --> 06:43.160
it's under the testimony of the witness,

06:43.160 --> 06:48.040
99.5% of which consisted in saying our abuse to answer

06:48.040 --> 06:51.080
on the ground of my tenement promenade.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.880
I looked out on the Hudson River and the beauty

06:52.880 --> 06:57.680
out this side and thought of America and New York.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.320
And all the liberties under the Constitution.

07:00.320 --> 07:05.280
I just thought, Frank Erickson, when he walks out of this courtroom today,

07:05.280 --> 07:09.920
goes to his home, or goes back to his temporary abiding place,

07:09.920 --> 07:11.720
ought to sing it to David in his heart and say,

07:11.720 --> 07:15.640
thank God this hearing is being held in Soviet Russia.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.040
I do.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.200
I do.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.200
Well, you don't want to change your mind

07:26.200 --> 07:29.200
and really tell us some information,

07:29.200 --> 07:32.200
which would be very useful to you to even Mr. Erickson.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.200
I have no idea.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.200
There are a lot of things you could tell us about,

07:36.200 --> 07:38.200
which would be a very interesting thing.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.200
I'm sure I had nothing.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.200
Senator O'Connor.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.200
Jackson, what I said previously was not said

07:43.200 --> 07:46.200
by way of any threat or intimidation,

07:46.200 --> 07:49.200
or to force you to testify it was, however,

07:49.200 --> 07:55.200
and is, in endeavor to give you the opportunity

07:55.200 --> 07:58.200
to state what you know regarding others,

07:58.200 --> 08:01.200
if not about yourself, and about matters

08:01.200 --> 08:03.200
which will not tend to incriminate you,

08:03.200 --> 08:06.200
but which you unquestionably know about others.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.200
And again, I repeat that by refusing to do so,

08:09.200 --> 08:13.200
you are not only giving a direct and then outrageous

08:13.200 --> 08:15.200
to front to the United States Senate,

08:15.200 --> 08:18.200
but you are attempting to nullify all of this committee

08:18.200 --> 08:20.200
as I'm taken to do, and for that reason, I think,

08:20.200 --> 08:23.200
unquestionably, if you persist in your attitude,

08:23.200 --> 08:26.200
you are guilty of contempt in the United States Senate.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.200
I have no reply, Mr. Senator.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.200
All right, that's all, Mr. Erickson.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.200
Where are you leaving?

08:37.200 --> 08:40.200
And Cought, Erickson, has started back to the New York City

08:40.200 --> 08:43.200
Riker Island Penitentiary, where he's serving his time.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.200
One of the few prominent lawbreakers

08:45.200 --> 08:48.200
to be convicted and jailed, and as such,

08:48.200 --> 08:51.200
a rare bird in underworld circles.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.200
Joe Adonis makes a dapper appearance

08:53.200 --> 08:55.200
as he proceeds to the crime investigation,

08:55.200 --> 08:58.200
named by the committee as the head of a crime syndicate

08:58.200 --> 09:00.200
and is using racketeering methods

09:00.200 --> 09:02.200
to invade legitimate business.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.200
He is advised by the same council

09:04.200 --> 09:07.200
that represented Erickson, Mr. Corbin.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.200
Adonis, whose real name is Dotto,

09:09.200 --> 09:12.200
takes the witness chair with a prepared statement

09:12.200 --> 09:15.200
which he has permitted to read.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.200
Since my previous appearance,

09:19.200 --> 09:23.200
the press has carried a release by this committee,

09:23.200 --> 09:26.200
alleging that I am a member of a crime syndicate

09:26.200 --> 09:31.200
operating throughout the East and Achim and Conjunction with

09:31.200 --> 09:34.200
another crime syndicate in Chicago.

09:34.200 --> 09:39.200
The release also asserted that one Luciano sits in Italy

09:39.200 --> 09:43.200
as arbitrator of all disputes among various crime syndicates.

09:43.200 --> 09:48.200
It is further said that I am a member of an organization

09:48.200 --> 09:51.200
known as the Mafia, which controls crime

09:51.200 --> 09:56.200
on an interstate and national basis.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.200
After reading his statement,

09:58.200 --> 10:00.200
Adonis left the hearing, saying he did not want to talk

10:00.200 --> 10:02.200
any further at this time.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.200
He refused to answer questions on constitutional grounds,

10:05.200 --> 10:08.200
although he faces contempt charges for his stand.

10:08.200 --> 10:13.200
Frank Costello was another witness to answer the committee

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
of Sapina in New York.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.200
Describe in Senator Keefhover's report as a partner

10:17.200 --> 10:21.200
with Joe Adonis in one of the two widespread crime syndicates

10:21.200 --> 10:23.200
operating in the United States.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.200
The Italian-born Costello told reporters

10:25.200 --> 10:28.200
the charge was purely fictional.

10:28.200 --> 10:31.200
You are playing, Testello.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.200
Yes, sir.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.200
No, you sound like swear.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.200
The testimony is given to this committee.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.200
I'll be the truth, the whole truth is nothing but the truth

10:38.200 --> 10:39.200
of how you got it.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.200
Yes, sir.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.200
The committee has evidently delved deeply into Costello's past

10:46.200 --> 10:50.200
to become well acquainted with his record when there is a record.

10:50.200 --> 10:56.200
So he has asked about a brush with the law that happened in 1915.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.200
I was convicted for Mr. Pino.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.200
Way convicted for possession of a revolve.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.200
That's right, yes sir.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.200
March 12, 19 to 10.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.200
Yes.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
Is that right?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.200
Yes.

11:08.200 --> 11:12.200
And on that occasion, did you use the name Frank Tobario?

11:12.200 --> 11:13.200
Yes.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
I imagine I did that.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.200
No man, whether it's Frank Costello or Charles Tobio,

11:18.200 --> 11:21.200
Mr. Wolf, he's the God, man of the devil,

11:21.200 --> 11:23.200
as long as the only and none say it's the truth.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
And we're here to get into facts.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.200
And so was I with the examination.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.200
And these facts about how to ask him to confirm,

11:29.200 --> 11:32.200
and I said, if these are the facts,

11:32.200 --> 11:34.200
dividends to me and benefits to me,

11:34.200 --> 11:36.200
the man is in this country illegally,

11:36.200 --> 11:39.200
and he committed a crime in falsifying the records.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.200
That is all.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.200
Then with the threat of deportation proceedings hanging over his head,

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200
Costello has asked how much he is worth.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.200
He refuses to tell.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.200
What is your net worth?

11:53.200 --> 11:58.200
I refuse to answer in my intent to culminate me.

11:59.200 --> 12:03.200
Do you have $100,000 in cash and that's strong, Bob?

12:03.200 --> 12:05.200
I said I would not know.

12:05.200 --> 12:11.200
You know, the chair feels it's necessary to advise the witness

12:11.200 --> 12:15.200
that any state body makes is being made under oath,

12:15.200 --> 12:18.200
and subjects him to a charge of perjury.

12:18.200 --> 12:23.200
And the committee does not feel that the witness is at this juncture,

12:23.200 --> 12:26.200
and without passing on other testimony at this time,

12:27.200 --> 12:30.200
answering the questions truthfully.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.200
And rather than just going to go on,

12:33.200 --> 12:37.200
the chair feels it is advisable to admonish the witness

12:37.200 --> 12:39.200
who has, of course, the benefit of his counsel

12:39.200 --> 12:45.200
to be extremely careful in this response.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.200
Mr. Chairman, why not adopt the policy?

12:47.200 --> 12:50.200
We adopt it about under a New Jersey policeman out there,

12:50.200 --> 12:53.200
sending one of our good men up to his house and his presence,

12:54.200 --> 12:57.200
opening the box and counting the money in to get a concertification of it,

12:57.200 --> 13:00.200
get out of brass tax here.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.200
It played ducks and ducks enough for this lot of stuff.

13:03.200 --> 13:09.200
You now have an opportunity to make any explanation you desire in regard to it.

13:10.200 --> 13:17.200
Well, I wouldn't know exactly, but I might have 40 or 60, 75,000 in there I wouldn't know it.

13:17.200 --> 13:22.200
In other words, is the committee to understand that to the best of your knowledge,

13:22.200 --> 13:30.200
the amount of case that you have in the box is approximately 40 or 50,000 dollars?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.200
All right.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.200
Another day, the committee heard an illness plea on Castello's behalf

13:37.200 --> 13:41.200
and was asked for a postponement of his questioning on the grounds that his mental faculties

13:41.200 --> 13:44.200
have been dulled by his condition.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.200
George Wolf Castello's lawyer spoke for his client.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.200
He asks that this examination be postponed to such time

13:51.200 --> 13:55.200
when he is physically and mentally able to continue

13:55.200 --> 14:02.200
and in surroundings and under psychinstances where he can testify properly and defend himself.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.200
All right.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.200
I have a low condition, just a five.

14:08.200 --> 14:15.200
You heard my statement through Mr. Wolf and I stand by it and the low condition will I testify?

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
From here?

14:16.200 --> 14:18.200
And until I am well enough.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.200
Are you refused to testify, Father?

14:21.200 --> 14:22.200
Absolutely.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.200
You ask questions, Mr. Hallean. We'll see.

14:29.200 --> 14:34.200
I said the same at the chairman that for a sick man, Mr. Castello

14:34.200 --> 14:38.200
was a very astute witness in my opinion the last two days

14:38.200 --> 14:41.200
and a very difficult witness to cross the dam.

14:41.200 --> 14:45.200
Senator, I want to figure out my health voice.

14:45.200 --> 14:50.200
I'm only here as a witness and I want to protect myself.

14:50.200 --> 14:57.200
When I testify, I want to testify truthfully and I can't my mind don't function.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.200
Well, your mind seems to be functioning pretty well.

15:01.200 --> 15:06.200
You seem to be able to understand things pretty well, Mr. Castello.

15:06.200 --> 15:10.200
I'm not going ahead in that, but all right, it's happening.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.200
I'm going to proceed, Mr. Hallean.

15:17.200 --> 15:24.200
Mr. Castello, did you hear the testimony of Mr. Francis McLaughlin yet today?

15:24.200 --> 15:26.200
No, the defense of it.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.200
Mr. Hallean, all due respect for the sound which I have,

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
an awful lot of respect for.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.200
I'm not going to answer another question.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.200
You just because I'm not under arrest and I'm going to walk out.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.200
Now, I should explain to you exactly what the legal situation is.

15:42.200 --> 15:52.200
You are under the painter and if, as I assume, the chairman instructs you to remain and answer questions,

15:52.200 --> 15:58.200
you will thereby become guilty of contempt of the Senate committee.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.200
And just a minute, Mr. Wolf. Just a minute, Mr. Castello.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.200
We don't mean that.

16:03.200 --> 16:10.200
Will you as ever resource in our command to see that he's brought to contempt and that he's arrested by the United States Senate?

16:10.200 --> 16:18.200
The warning that he could be cited for contempt did not, however, deter Castello, and he left the hearing accompanied by his counsel.

16:18.200 --> 16:23.200
He could now be subject to apprehension because the committee warned him when he first started to walk out

16:23.200 --> 16:29.200
that it had the legal right to recommend the United States Senate that a warrant of arrest be issued.

16:29.200 --> 16:33.200
Pointing out that in cases like this, it was not powerless to act.

16:41.200 --> 16:54.200
The warnings were well-pundered. For on a later day, Castello reappeared before the investigators.

16:54.200 --> 17:04.200
Do you have any safe deposit boxes, anywhere other than the box in your home?

17:05.200 --> 17:06.200
No.

17:07.200 --> 17:16.200
Do you have any places where you keep cash money, any place, than the one box you have described in your home?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.200
No.

17:21.200 --> 17:26.200
Do you have any one who holds cash money for you?

17:28.200 --> 17:30.200
That holds cash money for me?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.200
No.

17:38.200 --> 17:45.200
But you refuse to ask whether or not you have any cash money. Other than those you have described.

17:48.200 --> 17:54.200
Well, I might have some other cash money, but I'm not, I haven't got no box.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.200
Where do you have it?

17:57.200 --> 17:59.200
Well, I refuse to disclose that.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.200
No, Mr. Pointell.

18:01.200 --> 18:07.200
Well, Mr. Pistello, we'll have to ask, direct you to answer that question.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.200
Well, I'll have to consult my counselor and that question.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.200
All right, you can see it.

18:13.200 --> 18:22.200
No, I just point out it was counsel. When we were here in February together in executive session, the closing of the hearing, I asked Mr. Castello, what is his net worth?

18:23.200 --> 18:33.200
And you interpolated with him and taught together back there and you agreed, gave your word, that you would have that statement of assets and liabilities and net worth further in the few days.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.200
That's over six weeks ago. It hasn't come.

18:36.200 --> 18:43.200
Here's a witness before the United States Senate subcommittee. We're examining about his life and his past and assets and liabilities.

18:43.200 --> 18:48.200
Every time we get to the point of knowing where he's worth, what his net worth is, we're shunted aside.

18:48.200 --> 18:53.200
Now, you're a lawyer. I'll tell you anything I know. It might reflect and it might not.

18:53.200 --> 18:59.200
But the world would think well as it came through that way. It can't think well of a man that covers up every time.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.200
And that's these things.

19:00.200 --> 19:06.200
I disagree with the other Senate's attorney. I don't think he's seeking to cover up at every occasion.

19:06.200 --> 19:10.200
Anybody, any sum of money, an excess of $1,000.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.200
Yes.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.200
What if the total amount of your indebtedness?

19:14.200 --> 19:17.200
$30,000.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.200
And to whom do you all that?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.200
Mr. Erickson.

19:21.200 --> 19:25.200
And that is the $30,000 we talked about some time ago.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.200
That's right.

19:27.200 --> 19:32.200
Why did you have trouble indebted it? Mr. Hot-duller?

19:32.200 --> 19:35.200
Why did the client answer that question?

19:35.200 --> 19:38.200
Well, you were directed to answer that question, too.

19:38.200 --> 19:42.200
I still decline. I go into my net weight.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.200
I have to have objective prior.

19:46.200 --> 19:51.200
Why did you decide to take out naturalization papers in this country?

19:56.200 --> 19:59.200
I want to be an American citizen.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.200
And why did you want to be an American citizen?

20:05.200 --> 20:08.200
Well, I, of course, I love this country.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.200
During these years since you have been here,

20:11.200 --> 20:15.200
have you prized the privilege of being a citizen of the United States?

20:18.200 --> 20:20.200
I believe I have.

20:20.200 --> 20:24.200
Do you appreciate the rights that are yours as an American citizen?

20:25.200 --> 20:27.200
I do.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.200
Has this country come up to your anticipation?

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
Has it?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
Yes.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.200
In the years which you have elapsed and became a citizen,

20:39.200 --> 20:42.200
you have fed pretty well in material things, have you not?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.200
I have.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.200
Yes.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.200
Whole money and so forth, friend.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.200
Yes.

20:47.200 --> 20:52.200
When you signed or had someone signed your naturalization papers,

20:52.200 --> 20:57.200
what did you promise to do as a citizen of the United States?

20:58.200 --> 21:00.200
Well, I promised obey.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.200
May I say obey what?

21:02.200 --> 21:04.200
The Constitution and the laws.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.200
That's right.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.200
All right.

21:06.200 --> 21:10.200
Have you always upheld the Constitution and the laws of your state and nation?

21:16.200 --> 21:18.200
I believe I have.

21:18.200 --> 21:22.200
Have you ever offered your services to any war effort of this country?

21:27.200 --> 21:28.200
No.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.200
Baring in mind all that you have gained and received in wealth,

21:33.200 --> 21:36.200
what have you ever done to your country as a good citizen?

21:38.200 --> 21:42.200
Well, I don't know what you claim, what you mean by that.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.200
Well, you're looking back over the years.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.200
Now, at that time when you became a citizen,

21:46.200 --> 21:49.200
I'm in outstanding 20 odd years after that.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
You must have in your mind something you've done

21:51.200 --> 21:54.200
that you can speak up to your credit as an American citizen.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.200
If so, what are they?

21:56.200 --> 21:58.200
Paid my tax.

22:03.200 --> 22:07.200
You were a bootlegger in 1922,

22:07.200 --> 22:12.200
later bringing liquor in and an orange and a habit brought in from Ringelund County.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.200
Is that correct?

22:13.200 --> 22:14.200
No, it's incorrect.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.200
On your testimony before us, I think the record was substantiated.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.200
But if you did bring liquor in and were a bootlegger,

22:20.200 --> 22:24.200
then you were against the laws and the Constitution, are you not?

22:24.200 --> 22:29.200
You've thought of the Constitution and the value of the laws.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.200
If that evidence is correct, then I speak of.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.200
Is that right?

22:32.200 --> 22:33.200
If the evidence is correct.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.200
But I haven't.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.200
Didn't you bring liquor in and a causative body in from Canada?

22:37.200 --> 22:38.200
An elude to it is your liquor?

22:38.200 --> 22:42.200
One of the gatherings and didn't you sell it to people in this country?

22:42.200 --> 22:45.200
I bought liquor and sold it, but I didn't directly...

22:45.200 --> 22:49.200
When you did that, you brought the laws and thought of the Constitution, did you not?

22:49.200 --> 22:51.200
Why don't you call it that, yes?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.200
You call it that?

22:52.200 --> 22:53.200
Yes.

22:53.200 --> 23:03.200
You realize with me and all good citizens that there can be no qualified allegiance to the Constitution of the United States?

23:03.200 --> 23:05.200
Well, I wasn't the only one.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.200
I didn't ask you that.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.200
You're the only man I'm questioning now, sir.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.200
You're the one man I'm questioning now.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.200
And I'm asking Frank Costello if that is a truth yet.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.200
Yes, sir.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.200
Yes, all right.

23:15.200 --> 23:26.200
Mrs. Virginia Hill Hauser makes her way through exploding flashlights to become a national figure as a witness in the crime probe.

23:26.200 --> 23:33.200
The Alabama-born ex-Waitress and the admitted former girlfriend of the slain California raccoteer Ben Buggsy Segal,

23:33.200 --> 23:37.200
Mrs. Hauser is a stylishly clad figure as she takes the oath.

23:37.200 --> 23:44.200
Unlike the preceding mails on the stand, she proves a valuable witness, with ready answers to all the counsel's questions about her life,

23:44.200 --> 23:47.200
her indomits, and her associations.

23:47.200 --> 23:53.200
Mr. Tao, the right-hand picture in there.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.200
All right.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.200
Now, let's just don't flash any more bobs for it.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.200
Those are the male men in the men in the hateful way.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.200
All right.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.200
Let's don't flash any more bobs.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.200
It's a skivly young lady of chance.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.200
All right.

24:04.200 --> 24:10.200
I'll play the most witness as a Pat Defectious Taken and they stopped as soon as he started testifying.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.200
And what I did.

24:13.200 --> 24:19.200
Well, I'm sure that they don't intend to upset you, so let's try to just go ahead with the testimony.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.200
What is your full name?

24:21.200 --> 24:23.200
Virginia Hill, Hauser.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.200
Sorry, your own way.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.200
Well, I worked a while.

24:28.200 --> 24:36.200
The men I was around gave me things were not gangsters or raccoteers or whatever you call these other people.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.200
The only time I ever got anything from them was going out and having fun.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.200
It made me a few presents.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.200
But I happened to go with other sellers.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.200
And years I've been going to Mexico.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.200
I went with sellers down there.

24:48.200 --> 24:55.200
And like a lot of girls, they've given me things and bought me everything I want.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.200
And when I was with Ben, he paid for everything.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.200
By Ben, you mean Ben Seagull.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.200
Yes.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.200
And he gave me some money, too.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.200
He bought me a house in Florida.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.200
And then I used to bed horses.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.200
They asked me how much I don't know.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.200
I figured whatever was close.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.200
I don't know if it's right or it's wrong.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.200
I paid in some tax on that.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.200
That money I used to save it.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.200
When I'm supposed to be out giving these parties, it was always that I was going with.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.200
They paid for things that I did.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.200
I didn't pay for it.

25:26.200 --> 25:29.200
If I was paying for it, I wouldn't have gone in the first place.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.200
After all, I didn't have to give my own parties.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.200
I don't think.

25:32.200 --> 25:40.200
Did you ever get any money from any other person whom we might fall against, or other than Seagull?

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
No.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.200
Did you ever get any money from a cocktail?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.200
No.

25:50.200 --> 25:54.200
And did you ever get any money from my own ski?

25:54.200 --> 25:57.200
I never got money from any of those fellows.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.200
None of those fellows.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.200
None of these that I've been reading about.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.200
And none of that I knew they never gave me anything.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.200
None of the shitties.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.200
No.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.200
I don't even speak to them.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.200
I mean, I met that Charlie once or twice.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.200
I don't even talk to him.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.200
You don't like him?

26:11.200 --> 26:12.200
No.

26:14.200 --> 26:29.200
Now, I have a note that you once told an agent for the internal revenue that you were on occasion asked to carry cash

26:30.200 --> 26:31.200
between Chicago and New York.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.200
That is not true.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.200
And if they told that, they told life.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.200
The only cash I've ever carried is what belonged to me.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.200
And I've never carried anything for anybody.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.200
And if anyone said that, that's a big lie.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.200
And I don't care who said it.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.200
If anybody said yes, that is what that is.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.200
Yes, because the only cash I ever carried was my own.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.200
And I never carried anything for anybody.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.200
You cash or anything else?

26:51.200 --> 26:52.200
You never carried anything.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.200
No, I didn't.

26:54.200 --> 26:58.200
Regarding the unsolved murder of Siegel, she's no help to the committee.

26:58.200 --> 27:03.200
A Siegel was having trouble with any of his gang's spread.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.200
I never heard any time that he was having any trouble.

27:06.200 --> 27:09.200
And I never, all I know that he was worried about that hotel.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.200
And I hate the place.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.200
And I told him why didn't you leave it?

27:12.200 --> 27:15.200
And get away from it because it was making him a nervous wreck.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.200
You are leaving with completely a personal matter.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.200
Yes, it was.

27:20.200 --> 27:25.200
Do you have any theory about what happened to it?

27:25.200 --> 27:26.200
Who it was headed in for him?

27:26.200 --> 27:27.200
I don't want to mention it.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.200
With the chief father, if I knew anything about it, believe me,

27:30.200 --> 27:32.200
I'd be the first one to tell.

27:32.200 --> 27:36.200
A foreign investigator is a glimpse at the method of dope peddlers.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.200
She relates.

27:37.200 --> 27:42.200
Once I would come up with a lot of agency, which I didn't know what was.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.200
I didn't know what I asked.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
And what was that?

27:44.200 --> 27:45.200
And he told me it was Harry and Cocaine.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.200
I told him to get out of my house.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.200
And he says, well, don't I know people.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.200
I said, they'd break my neck if I even mentioned such a thing.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.200
And then I had people used to come and say, don't you want some?

27:56.200 --> 28:00.200
I had an awful time getting rid of people down there that offered it to me.

28:00.200 --> 28:04.200
Did somebody want to try to get you to help sell it?

28:04.200 --> 28:05.200
And you refused?

28:05.200 --> 28:06.200
Yes.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.200
And who was that?

28:10.200 --> 28:13.200
It was an ex-brother-in-law of mine.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.200
And then we have his name?

28:16.200 --> 28:18.200
His name was Validez.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.200
I was Gonzales.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.200
I don't know what his first name is.

28:21.200 --> 28:25.200
But at first, you know you've never had anything to do with it.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.200
I have never.

28:26.200 --> 28:30.200
And the only time I ever come and contact, I even heard about it,

28:30.200 --> 28:34.200
was then when I asked somebody, what gives you the idea that I want any of that stuff?

28:34.200 --> 28:35.200
They said, well, the papers.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.200
I said, well, you better not read the papers.

28:37.200 --> 28:42.200
I threatened to break one's neck if they even come around me anymore with that stuff or even mentioned it.

28:43.200 --> 28:49.200
Complications of finance are given an airing by the witness when she's asked about her income.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.200
Maybe $15 to $20,000.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.200
Well, you'd spent about 30 of your own.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.200
Well, yes, but I just bought a house.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.200
I'd say, how much did you spend for the house?

28:59.200 --> 29:02.200
Well, I paid $16,000 down.

29:02.200 --> 29:08.200
And how much money have you spent in addition for the money you spent on the house?

29:08.200 --> 29:11.200
Well, you mean,

29:11.200 --> 29:13.200
now since I got that house.

29:13.200 --> 29:18.200
The last year, you spent this $11,000 in Sun Valley.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.200
Oh, that, I didn't even spend.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.200
And then since then, without having that.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.200
Since then, we go after that.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.200
Well, since I got married.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.200
How much did you spend after that?

29:26.200 --> 29:29.200
Well, maybe $15,000 or $20,000.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.200
I don't know.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.200
Maybe $20,000.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.200
Maybe.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.200
And it could be more though, could it not?

29:34.200 --> 29:37.200
I don't think it could be any more because I haven't been going anyplace.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.200
I only had a baby and that didn't cost too much.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.200
Well, I suppose that would be fine.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.200
And that wasn't by a hard bar.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.200
I wasn't going anyplace.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.200
I rented a place by 1800 for the season.

29:52.200 --> 29:57.200
So please say what you think you earn in a rough, round figure without giving details.

29:57.200 --> 30:01.200
And don't think to have the trouble of accounting to Uncle Sam the way the rest of us do.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.200
Well, then he'll have to take care of that, won't he?

30:04.200 --> 30:05.200
Uncle Sam?

30:05.200 --> 30:06.200
Yeah.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.200
Well, maybe he will, perhaps he could.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.200
Well, that's fine.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.200
Sure.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.200
I don't blame him.

30:10.200 --> 30:22.200
Now, then getting back to 46, we have wages on various sporting events, $23,870, as you're

30:22.200 --> 30:23.200
in common.

30:23.200 --> 30:26.200
That's also signed by Mr. Ross.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.200
Well, it's all the same thing.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.200
It's all when I've given Mr. Sam a few months.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
That's what I've given him.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.200
It's all the same.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.200
I don't know.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.200
And that's what he told me.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.200
And that's what I guess I told Mr. Ross or he told him.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.200
I don't know who told him.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.200
I don't remember anything about those things.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.200
I don't.

30:41.200 --> 30:48.200
I was wondering if it was a coincidence that in 45, you again just happened to win $16,000

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
on sporting event.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.200
Well, maybe I won more.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.200
Maybe I won less.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.200
That's what I said.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.200
I don't know.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.200
And the testimony reveals she's no two-buck better.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.200
I used to get tips from people.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.200
How do you do that?

31:00.200 --> 31:02.200
We'd be interested in that.

31:02.200 --> 31:05.200
Well, I used to know some people.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.200
When they would get good tips, they would give them to me.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.200
Some were bookmakers.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200
Some were around the tracks.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.200
I don't know.

31:12.200 --> 31:17.200
But they used to give me the horses all the time and tell me.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.200
And sometimes Mr. Epstein used to make the bets for me.

31:21.200 --> 31:32.200
Apparently every year you're able to win the rather substantial amounts of money from $15,000 to $30,000.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.200
That's right.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.200
How much would your bet on horses?

31:36.200 --> 31:43.200
Sometimes I'd bet hundreds, 200, 500, depending on the horse.

31:43.200 --> 31:48.200
And how good your tip was also?

31:48.200 --> 31:50.200
You're still bet the horse rate?

31:50.200 --> 31:51.200
I've the only thing I've...

31:51.200 --> 31:53.200
Now, I don't bet anything.

31:53.200 --> 31:58.200
Now I'm afraid I'll win and then they'll say I made more money than I did.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.200
You mean you just don't want to win anymore?

32:02.200 --> 32:04.200
I don't want anymore.

32:04.200 --> 32:12.200
The 35-year-old witness, now the wife of a skiing instructor, has recently become a mother at low cost according to her own testimony.

32:12.200 --> 32:19.200
And in all probability is one of the most unusual witnesses ever questioned by a senatorial committee.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.200
You
