00:00.000 --> 00:09.880
I will strive in the future as I have in the past to advance the forward-looking, aggressive

00:09.880 --> 00:16.760
traditions of the Democratic Party, which have characterized the administrations of President

00:16.760 --> 00:21.120
Roosevelt and Truman.

00:21.120 --> 00:30.420
We must continue to seek solutions to great social problems in human terms, something

00:30.420 --> 00:34.420
which the Republicans have signally failed to do.

00:34.420 --> 00:39.860
Senator, do you believe you can beat President Eisenhower, should he run?

00:39.860 --> 00:47.500
I do not know that I do not have the personal charm or popularity of our distinguished president.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.380
I do hope that he will soon be restored to fully to his health so that he will be in

00:52.380 --> 00:54.660
a position to run.

00:54.660 --> 01:01.300
But I feel that the strength of the Democratic Party is such that even with his great popularity

01:01.300 --> 01:06.740
at the Democratic Party and that I could win in the election in November.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.300
I am very glad to be here.

02:31.300 --> 02:39.740
I think the Congress ought to consider whether that identity of action is a violation of

02:39.740 --> 02:43.300
the antitrust laws and other antitrust laws need to be amended.

02:43.300 --> 02:50.900
Of course, as to preventing increases or rolling back this increase about the only thing that

02:50.900 --> 02:56.540
can be done now is a strong plea on the part of the President to both industry and labor,

02:57.540 --> 03:03.540
try to work out some method in the general good of our economy so that this price can be rolled back.

03:03.540 --> 03:11.540
If that isn't done, we are going to have demands for price and wage controls, other kinds of laws

03:11.540 --> 03:16.540
that require the giving of notice before a price increases made and things of that kind.

03:16.540 --> 03:23.540
I hope we do not have to get to price and wage controls, but I do want to say that the economy

03:23.540 --> 03:31.540
cannot stand this spiraling of prices every year with its resilient hardship upon the consumers

03:31.540 --> 03:35.540
and the purchasers of the United States.
