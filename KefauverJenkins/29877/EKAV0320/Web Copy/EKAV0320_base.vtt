00:00.000 --> 00:21.160
This is your senator, Estes Keifoffer, who is one of the busiest legislators in Washington.

00:21.160 --> 00:25.360
He has constantly engaged in legislative activity which benefits the people of the great state

00:25.360 --> 00:28.320
of Tennessee, as well as all Americans.

00:28.320 --> 00:32.040
Despite his busy schedule, Senator Keifoffer looks forward to being with his wife and children

00:32.040 --> 00:37.400
in the evening when he have an opportunity to discuss their normal family activities.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.200
Senator Keifoffer has received wide acclaim for his work in the crime investigations and

00:41.200 --> 00:44.920
to trust hearings and the present investigations into the drug industry.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.360
He is also vitally concerned with matters of great local interests such as TBA, the

00:49.360 --> 00:54.000
Reclamation Projects, Farm Legislation, the high cost of living and numerous other problems

00:54.000 --> 00:56.040
that affect your everyday life.

00:56.040 --> 01:02.600
Senator Keifoffer has served in Congress in 1939 and has been in the Senate for 12 years.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.240
As your personal representative and friend, the senator would like to meet you.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.880
So let's join the family in their Washington home.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.880
Senator Keifoffer.

01:11.880 --> 01:18.040
My friends, I certainly would like to be with you and personal on this occasion.

01:18.040 --> 01:22.160
But of course I have a lot of places to be in Tennessee.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.240
I do hope that during the summer I can have an opportunity of visiting with you personally

01:26.240 --> 01:30.800
and talking with as many of you as possible.

01:30.800 --> 01:37.480
But on this occasion I do want you to meet again my family, my wife Nancy, whom all of

01:37.480 --> 01:39.280
you know.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.240
And Nancy, you want to say something to the...

01:42.240 --> 01:44.880
Yes, I'm glad to be with you too.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.840
I actually want to get down to Tennessee as much as I can this summer and be with you

01:48.840 --> 01:51.760
in the next few months.

01:51.760 --> 01:57.840
And then our oldest daughter cannot be with us on this occasion because she's struggling

01:57.840 --> 02:01.480
hard to try to get by her freshman year at Vanderbilt.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.280
But Nancy, I think you got a picture of Linda.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.360
You didn't see that when it just came in the mail the other day.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.840
Well, I'm anxious to see it and I know that Linda will be with us this summer a great

02:11.840 --> 02:12.840
deal too.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.760
And here's my great big boy David.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.760
David Estes, Keifoffer.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.880
David, how are you getting along?

02:18.880 --> 02:24.160
At school we just had a fair and I want to cat it.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.160
Oh, school, that's fair.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.440
Well, I'll be able to get it.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.440
That made two cats.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.000
We had what you do with that little bit of kitten.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.480
Well, I had to give it away.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.960
Because we already had two dogs in one cat.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.200
You mean you drew a number in one little kitten?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.200
Yes.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.320
I used a cute little kitten I saw him but I saw to agree with you that one around the

02:44.320 --> 02:48.320
house may be enough.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.840
And Diane, this is our daughter Diane.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.320
She's now 12 years old and she goes to school.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.880
What are you going to do this summer Diane?

02:55.880 --> 03:02.160
Well, I'm planning to go down to Tennessee after camp and help my sister around the house.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.080
Want to help Linda run our little house on lookout mountain?

03:05.080 --> 03:10.000
Well, I hope that we just got our house finished this last summer.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.560
We hope that as many of you as possible may come and visit us sometime when we're there.

03:15.560 --> 03:20.880
Well, I believe you have a big job of feeding the dogs in the cat most of the time, don't

03:20.880 --> 03:21.880
you?

03:21.880 --> 03:22.880
Diane.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.880
I'm supposed to.

03:23.880 --> 03:24.880
I'm supposed to, but...

03:24.880 --> 03:28.160
Well, Gail, how are you getting along, sweetie?

03:28.160 --> 03:31.400
Gail is nine years old.

03:31.400 --> 03:35.920
And are you going to come down and travel around with her sometime this summer?

03:35.920 --> 03:38.120
Yeah, well, I got to get a camp first.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.120
Uh-huh.

03:39.120 --> 03:44.080
And then I remember four years ago you went several places with Nancy and me when we were

03:44.080 --> 03:47.680
in our campaign and what you do in there when you went around.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.320
They're going your buttons.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.960
Put buttons on people.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.680
I remember you put a button on, you tried to give a fellow a button, he wouldn't take

03:55.680 --> 03:57.000
one and what you do then.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.880
But I don't think it's good.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.360
Well, that's a...

04:02.360 --> 04:06.920
You were so little and you had to reach up and put it on the back of his coat, but I guess

04:06.920 --> 04:09.560
this time you can do it a whole lot better.

04:09.560 --> 04:13.520
Well, uh, David, what are you going to do when you got through?

04:13.520 --> 04:17.680
First, where are you going to go to college if you pass your grades and everything?

04:17.680 --> 04:23.920
Well, I'd like to go to the University of Tennessee because I believe that that has one

04:23.920 --> 04:26.840
of the best education for agriculture.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.840
You mean you're...

04:27.840 --> 04:29.160
You're going to help to be a farmer.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.320
You're going to be a farmer?

04:30.320 --> 04:33.320
Uh, down at Madisonville, maybe one of these days.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.400
Well, I bet you'll be a good farmer because you like to...

04:36.800 --> 04:40.720
You're always willing to mow the yard, which I don't do very often.

04:40.720 --> 04:47.680
And then, uh, um, Diane, you're like your mother, uh, you're somewhat of an artist.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
What is it?

04:48.680 --> 04:49.680
What is it that you like to draw?

04:49.680 --> 04:52.680
Well, I like to paint horses and...

04:52.680 --> 04:54.680
What's about that?

04:54.680 --> 04:59.680
Well, I guess we've been talking a whole lot about how Diane paints horses and...

04:59.680 --> 05:05.160
And then we did mention that you went down to the studio with Mummy once in a while and

05:05.160 --> 05:07.960
we might have proud of something that happened about your paintings other day.

05:07.960 --> 05:08.960
What was that?

05:08.960 --> 05:12.760
Well, I thought two of my paintings and I got two dollars.

05:12.760 --> 05:13.760
Oh, you did.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.560
Oh, yeah, that was wonderful.

05:15.560 --> 05:19.360
I don't think a little girl ever has been so excited just when somebody paid her $10

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
for a painting.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
That's...

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
$10 for a two-painting.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
$10 for two-painting, yeah, that's right.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
$5 feet.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.360
She loves to paint.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.360
Like, he owes a model, didn't she?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.360
No.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.360
You just like to paint?

05:30.360 --> 05:33.360
No, she just paints like that.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.360
Well, we have always have two good dogs and then...

05:38.360 --> 05:40.360
Diane, you want to tell us about...

05:40.360 --> 05:41.360
Tell the...

05:41.360 --> 05:44.360
Our friends about our present dogs?

05:44.360 --> 05:47.360
Well, one's of...

05:47.360 --> 05:50.360
Cocker Spaniel and his name's JoJo.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.360
We've had JoJo a long time.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
He's a pretty dog.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.360
Then what's the new one?

05:54.360 --> 05:56.360
It's an Irish setter.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.360
And her name's Amber.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.360
Well, they're certain they're their fine dogs.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.360
I think maybe they were in the picture here a little while ago.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.360
I know that every morning, when the mailman comes,

06:08.360 --> 06:11.360
you have a great big stack of mail for you.

06:11.360 --> 06:16.360
Down in the office, we got lots of mail from the people in Tennessee.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.360
You got a lot of mail.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.360
What do the...

06:20.360 --> 06:22.360
What kind of mail do you get?

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
And how do you answer it?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.360
Well, I get...

06:24.360 --> 06:28.360
I get a lot of mail from the women in tent throughout the state.

06:28.360 --> 06:34.360
And I think their problems just about the same as ours are here.

06:34.360 --> 06:38.360
I keep up quite a correspondence, as you know.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.360
And...

06:41.360 --> 06:47.360
Discussed our mutual problems about children and our food and everything else.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.360
I know a lot of them write you about education and about...

06:50.360 --> 06:53.360
How cost of living or about...

06:53.360 --> 06:55.360
In fact, they might be going to come to Washington.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.360
Of course, you know we have many visitors from the state.

06:59.360 --> 07:04.360
And we are constantly seeing people from Tennessee just last week

07:04.360 --> 07:09.360
we had over 20 women at the Democratic Convention here.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.360
So that's a grand way to keep in touch with what's going on at home.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.360
I think the good people we are visiting,

07:16.360 --> 07:20.360
whether people that particularly the women might be interested in a...

07:20.360 --> 07:23.360
Typical day of yours in Washington, Nancy.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.360
What you do and what you have to do and what your activities are.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.360
Well, of course, once a week the Senate late is meet.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.360
And that's a busy and amusing day.

07:34.360 --> 07:39.360
We get into uniform and go down to one of the rooms in the Senate.

07:39.360 --> 07:45.360
And roll bandages and prepare squares and everything for the Red Cross.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.360
And do a lot of talking too, Nancy.

07:47.360 --> 07:51.360
We do a lot of gossiping and exchange news about our various sections of the country.

07:51.360 --> 07:56.360
And we take our lunch in a little paper bag and we get cup of coffee and it's very informal.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.360
David, you're going to go out and campaign somewhere this summer?

07:59.360 --> 08:00.360
Yes, I hope to.

08:00.360 --> 08:01.360
And uh...

08:01.360 --> 08:06.360
Well, you know a lot of boys in Tennessee because you've been over to High Lake County.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.360
I think you're one of the oldest campers over there, aren't you?

08:09.360 --> 08:11.360
Yes, sir.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.360
And uh...

08:13.360 --> 08:19.360
What are you and Linda going to do when you got down to the house in Tennessee, Diane?

08:19.360 --> 08:22.360
Well, I guess mostly clean it up.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.360
And more the grass?

08:24.360 --> 08:25.360
Yeah.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.360
Well, Linda's big enough to more the grass, isn't she?

08:30.360 --> 08:32.360
Well, uh...

08:32.360 --> 08:34.360
We're plenty to do.

08:34.360 --> 08:42.360
I know that Nancy has about the same problem that most all mothers do in connection with education.

08:42.360 --> 08:46.360
I have to be aware of a great deal down at the office.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.360
Um...

08:48.360 --> 08:56.360
Nancy has the job of taking the kids around to the girls' scouts and to the brownies and to the boys' scouts.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.360
It's the arithmetic homework.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.360
I wish you'd stay home, boy.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.360
To help with that.

09:03.360 --> 09:09.360
When I'm helping Gayle with her arithmetic, you see, David and Diane are a jump ahead, so I come out pretty easily.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.360
And then when I have to help David, it's sometimes over my head.

09:13.360 --> 09:18.360
I remember you sent me a book on a 4-H club.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.360
You can have the reading, it seems.

09:21.360 --> 09:27.360
Yeah, well, I'm glad David wants to be a farmer because, um...

09:27.360 --> 09:32.360
We need more farmers, but they were having a many hard time as you know, David, but you'll be a good one, won't you?

09:32.360 --> 09:37.360
I don't know whether you ever actually be one, but he's never wanted to be anything else.

09:37.360 --> 09:42.360
Well, I always wanted to be a lawyer. I didn't know I'd ever be a politician, but I...

09:42.360 --> 09:44.360
You never can tell.

09:44.360 --> 09:51.360
Well, ladies and gentlemen, certainly has been good to visit with you on this occasion, and...

09:51.360 --> 09:58.360
I wish that our daughter, Linda, could be with us as well as David and Diane and Gayle,

09:58.360 --> 10:05.360
but we'll all be around this summer and try to see as many of you as possible.

10:05.360 --> 10:11.360
Now that you have had a visit with my family, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing some of the more pressing domestic issues,

10:11.360 --> 10:17.360
facing our state and our nation, and letting you know where I stand on them.

10:17.360 --> 10:22.360
Over the long haul, one of the most serious unsolved problems is high prices.

10:22.360 --> 10:29.360
We have been in an inflationary spiral for years, and prices have been going up almost constantly.

10:29.360 --> 10:35.360
If there is one group which does not need to be reminded of this fact, it is the Housewives.

10:35.360 --> 10:39.360
It is no consolation to them to be told that inflation has been slowed down.

10:40.360 --> 10:46.360
Prices still end up almost every month, and the net result over the years is indeed shocking.

10:46.360 --> 10:53.360
The causes of our inflationary spiral are very complex, and I won't try to oversimplify the problem.

10:53.360 --> 10:58.360
But one of the major causes is what the economist called administered prices.

10:58.360 --> 11:02.360
We layman normally think of them as collusive prices.

11:02.360 --> 11:08.360
What it amounts to is that a particular industry may be monopolized by a few huge companies,

11:08.360 --> 11:14.360
which then rigged the prices to eliminate competition and to assure extra-have profits.

11:14.360 --> 11:21.360
Such practices could not be more contrary to the basic concepts underlying our free enterprise system.

11:21.360 --> 11:25.360
I have held a number of hearings on monopolies in some of our industries,

11:25.360 --> 11:28.360
where competition has been almost completely eliminated.

11:28.360 --> 11:33.360
The steel industry and the electrical industry are excellent examples.

11:34.360 --> 11:40.360
More recently we held a long series of hearings to show why the cost of drugs to the drug is so excessive,

11:40.360 --> 11:45.360
and why the profits in the drug manufacturing industry are equally excessive.

11:45.360 --> 11:56.360
And I shall continue to press for legislation which will restore competition to those many industries which are now almost completely monopolized by a few huge firms.

11:57.360 --> 12:03.360
And I think that fiscal irresponsibility is also something against which we must always be on guard,

12:03.360 --> 12:06.360
because it has something to do with inflation too.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.360
The Congress can and does make substantial savings.

12:09.360 --> 12:14.360
We made cuts in the proposed budget at places where we felt that it could be done,

12:14.360 --> 12:19.360
commensurate with the national security and the general welfare of the country.

12:19.360 --> 12:23.360
For many years I was a member of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate,

12:23.360 --> 12:33.360
and we were able to eliminate to make many savings by eliminating many of the overlapping activities in our military reorganization bill.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.360
Activities and waste which has been so common in the Pentagon.

12:38.360 --> 12:43.360
Another problem which is crucial and complex is the farm situation.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.360
This problem gets worse and worse each year.

12:47.360 --> 12:54.360
One of the favorite indoor sports throughout the country these days seems to be a game called Beat Ezra Tath Benson,

12:54.360 --> 12:59.360
and he seems to be fair game for Democrats and Republicans alike.

12:59.360 --> 13:04.360
Well I think Mr. Benson has made a bad mess out of the farm situation,

13:04.360 --> 13:07.360
but whipping him will not solve the problems.

13:07.360 --> 13:12.360
There are many people who do not really understand how bad things are with the average farmer.

13:12.360 --> 13:22.360
There are few non-farmers for example, know that since 1951 the price of corn per bushel has dropped from 166 to 105 per bushel.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.360
And this is a 37% decrease.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.360
All that cut and see is down 43%.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.360
All that beef cattle are down 22%.

13:31.360 --> 13:37.360
All that millions of people have been leaving the farms and going into the already crowded cities.

13:37.360 --> 13:46.360
I could go on and on, but more figures would only underline the conclusion that the farmers are really in very bad straits.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.360
And this is particularly true of the small family farmer.

13:49.360 --> 13:56.360
Well I've spent a good part of my 22 years in Congress fighting for the survival of the small farmer.

13:56.360 --> 14:06.360
And we must find ways to protect the income of the small family size farmer and also find a way to assure that all farmers get their fair share of the farm dollar.

14:07.360 --> 14:11.360
At the same time we must protect the taxpayer and the consumer.

14:11.360 --> 14:17.360
I do not pretend that this will be easy, but I do contend that it can be done.

14:17.360 --> 14:23.360
One thing that I have urged is the establishment of a department of consumers and the federal government.

14:23.360 --> 14:31.360
We have departments of agriculture, commerce and of labor, but we have no department to look after the interest of the consumers.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.360
And every American is a consumer.

14:34.360 --> 14:39.360
And a department to look after are interest as consumers is long overdue.

14:39.360 --> 14:49.360
In my estimation, the third most serious domestic problem in the country today is that of providing first rate public schools to all of our children.

14:50.360 --> 15:02.360
Despite a massive effort on the part of states and local communities in building schools since World War II, there is still a shortage of 140,000 classrooms throughout the country.

15:02.360 --> 15:06.360
There is also a shortage of 195,000 teachers.

15:06.360 --> 15:11.360
Everyone knows the old adage about a picture being worth a thousand words.

15:12.360 --> 15:21.360
Here is a recent cartoon by the famous Bill Maudlin, which appeared in the Harold Rebun and which proves this point very neatly.

15:21.360 --> 15:27.360
The cartoon says, I'm not playing hooky, I just fell out.

15:27.360 --> 15:33.360
These shortages do not result from any lack of foresight or initiative on the part of local authorities.

15:34.360 --> 15:44.360
There are dear rather to the fact that our population is expanding at an extremely high rate and the fact that our local tax resources are stretched almost to the breaking point.

15:44.360 --> 15:49.360
It is for this reason that I believe that federal aid for education is vital.

15:49.360 --> 15:53.360
This aid can be given without any danger of federal control.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.360
The legislation has specific prohibitions on this point.

15:57.360 --> 16:07.360
It can be given in such a way that states decide how much of the aid is to be spent for school construction and how much for supplementing teacher salaries.

16:07.360 --> 16:15.360
Federal aid would be a particular assistance to states like Tennessee whose average income is below the national average.

16:15.360 --> 16:22.360
For every dollar paid in federal taxes paid by Tennesseans, we would get back more than $2 in federal aid.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.360
These are good national programs too.

16:25.360 --> 16:30.360
I have here a chart which was recently published by the Tennessee Municipal Association.

16:30.360 --> 16:39.360
It says federal grants in aid return $2.22 to Tennessee for every $1 in federal taxes.

16:39.360 --> 16:44.360
It is a tremendous bargain for state with only two-thirds US average.

16:44.360 --> 16:49.360
Well, let's take for example here. Here is water pollution control.

16:49.360 --> 16:58.360
The total spent in Tennessee is $4.52 million and Tennesseans paid for this program in taxes $1.9 million.

16:58.360 --> 17:06.360
Let's take a hospital construction which means so much to especially smaller cities of Tennessee.

17:06.360 --> 17:15.360
The total received in Tennessee was $47.2 million and Tennesseans for this program paid $16.4 million.

17:15.360 --> 17:20.360
And then others are on down the line as you will see.

17:20.360 --> 17:25.360
As I said before, the average is more than $2 in aid for every dollar in taxes.

17:25.360 --> 17:32.360
This is obviously a great bargain for Tennessee but it's also beneficial to the rest of the country.

17:32.360 --> 17:38.360
As the economic health of the country depends on the economic health of all of its sections.

17:38.360 --> 17:43.360
Well, I've heard a number of people argue that federal aid to education is vital.

17:43.360 --> 17:47.360
If we were to keep up with the Russians, well this is true.

17:47.360 --> 17:52.360
But I think that all American children are entitled to a first-rate education,

17:52.360 --> 17:56.360
even if a serious external threat did not exist.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.360
We are about far the richest nation in the world.

17:59.360 --> 18:06.360
We can certainly afford not only a decent education for our children but an excellent education.

18:06.360 --> 18:13.360
Well, this chart when you saw it a minute ago, you would notice that there is no mention of several very important programs.

18:13.360 --> 18:19.360
One of these is federal aid to depressed areas of which there are many in Tennessee.

18:19.360 --> 18:24.360
The Congress passed a bill to assist these blighted areas in their redevelopment.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.360
But this was unfortunately vetoed.

18:27.360 --> 18:34.360
And you also saw a few minutes ago no mention of a program for medical or hospital care for our agent,

18:34.360 --> 18:36.360
our senior citizens.

18:36.360 --> 18:45.360
We all know that this is a much needed program, since a great proportion of our older people have greatly increased medical and hospital expenses,

18:45.360 --> 18:47.360
when they are least able to pay for them.

18:47.360 --> 18:57.360
It is my hope and expectation that some adequate program that will give them some substantial relief may be enacted in the very near future.

18:57.360 --> 19:02.360
There are also a number of going concerns which are particularly interest to Tennessee,

19:02.360 --> 19:06.360
and which are the subject of constant sniping in Washington.

19:06.360 --> 19:13.360
A good example is the Tennessee Valley Authority, which is done more to revitalize the economy of Tennessee

19:13.360 --> 19:17.360
than anything else in the last hundred years, well in our history for that matter.

19:17.360 --> 19:24.360
There are constant attempts by the public power interest, either to chop it apart or at least to tie its hands.

19:25.360 --> 19:31.360
There are others who would destroy or limit the R.E.A. program, which is so vital to rural Tennessee.

19:31.360 --> 19:37.360
I am quite certain that all of the attempts to destroy these worthwhile projects will ultimately fail.

19:37.360 --> 19:45.360
But in a literal sense, there must be a constant vigilance in both the houses of Congress and among our people who are affected

19:45.360 --> 19:51.360
if they are to remain vital and effective for our continued use.

19:51.360 --> 20:01.360
Another subject which has occupied my time and attention to a great extent has been the national difficulty and problem of juvenile delinquency.

20:01.360 --> 20:08.360
As chairman of the Senate subcommittee dealing with this problem, we held hearings in various parts of the country.

20:08.360 --> 20:15.360
It was our object to enlist the cooperation of all government agencies, local, state, and federal,

20:15.360 --> 20:20.360
and to coordinate their efforts with those of the parents, schools, and the churches.

20:20.360 --> 20:24.360
In a sense we were engaged in an educational process.

20:24.360 --> 20:29.360
But in another sense we were engaged in a very important legislative process.

20:29.360 --> 20:37.360
We were able to get new to get new laws enacted to tighten up the traffic in the control and the control of narcotics.

20:37.360 --> 20:47.360
We are now working on legislation to strengthen the hands of the post office department and the Department of Justice in their battle against smut and obscenity.

20:47.360 --> 20:54.360
The Senate passed a bill for aid to the states and the training of personnel to combat juvenile delinquency.

20:54.360 --> 21:02.360
We also want to establish forestry camps, which we believe are superior to juvenile homes for many types of delinquents.

21:02.360 --> 21:12.360
Well as important as these domestic problems may be, I am sure that all of you are aware of the equal seriousness of our international situation.

21:12.360 --> 21:16.360
A permanent peace is something which we are yet to achieve.

21:16.360 --> 21:21.360
Meanwhile we must keep our country both militarily and economically strong.

21:21.360 --> 21:32.360
One of our greatest sources of strength is the unity of the Atlantic community, especially the cooperation which has been achieved within the NATO and the NATO nations.

21:32.360 --> 21:41.360
As long as the NATO countries stand together, war is unlikely because the communists know that we would win any war that they started.

21:42.360 --> 21:49.360
I have attended many meetings of the NATO parliamentarians who are the legislators from all of the NATO countries.

21:49.360 --> 22:02.360
I have worked for the establishment of the Atlantic Congress which was held last June, from which we hope to get a more closely net economic community in this part in this area of the world.

22:02.360 --> 22:10.360
Such a community could more fully share the cost of foreign aid, which we have supported almost alone for many years now.

22:10.360 --> 22:16.360
There are a number of other subjects which I should like to discuss with you, but I have already presumed upon your patience.

22:16.360 --> 22:21.360
Again let me say how sorry I am not to be with you in person on this occasion.

22:21.360 --> 22:26.360
And let me thank you very much for letting me visit with you on this film.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.360
you
