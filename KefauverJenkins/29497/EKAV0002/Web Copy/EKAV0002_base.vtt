00:00.000 --> 00:23.160
This is your senator, Estes Keifoffer, who is one of the busiest legislators in Washington.

00:23.160 --> 00:27.360
He has constantly engaged in legislative activity which benefits the people of the great state

00:27.360 --> 00:32.200
of Tennessee as well as all Americans. Despite his busy schedule, Senator Keifoffer

00:32.200 --> 00:36.240
looks forward to being with his wife and children in the evening when they have an opportunity

00:36.240 --> 00:41.080
to discuss their normal family activities. Senator Keifoffer has received why to claim

00:41.080 --> 00:45.240
for his work in the crime investigations and to trust hearings and the present investigations

00:45.240 --> 00:49.740
into the drug industry. He is also vitally concerned with matters of great local interests

00:49.740 --> 00:54.520
such as TBA, the Reclamation Projects Farm Legislation, the high cost of living and

00:54.520 --> 00:59.240
numerous other problems that affect your everyday life. Senator Keifoffer has served

00:59.240 --> 01:06.000
in Congress since 1939 and has been in the Senate for 12 years. As your personal representative

01:06.000 --> 01:11.440
and friend, the senator would like to meet you. So let's join the family in their Washington

01:11.440 --> 01:16.080
home. Senator Keifoffer.

01:16.080 --> 01:20.920
My friends, I certainly would like to be with you and personal on this occasion, but of

01:20.920 --> 01:25.980
course I have a lot of places to be in Tennessee. I do hope that during the summer I can have

01:25.980 --> 01:32.520
an opportunity of visiting with you personally and talking with as many of you as possible.

01:32.520 --> 01:39.460
But on this occasion I do want you to meet again my family, my wife Nancy whom all of

01:39.460 --> 01:44.240
you know and Nancy you want to say something to the...

01:44.240 --> 01:49.360
Yes, I'm glad to be with you too. I actually want to get down to Tennessee as much as I

01:49.360 --> 01:53.720
can the summer and be with you in the next few months.

01:53.720 --> 01:59.800
And then our oldest daughter cannot be with us on this occasion because she's struggling

01:59.800 --> 02:05.120
hard to try to get by her freshman year at Vanderbilt, but Nancy I think you got a picture

02:05.120 --> 02:07.640
of Linda. You didn't see that when it just came the

02:07.640 --> 02:13.200
mail the other day. Well I'm anxious to see it and I know that Linda will be with us this

02:13.200 --> 02:19.320
summer a great deal too. And here's my great big boy David. David Estes Keifoffer. David

02:19.320 --> 02:26.320
how are you getting along? Far from at school we just had a fair and I want to cat it.

02:26.320 --> 02:31.440
Oh school, that's fair. Well that may have to get out. That may have two cats we had.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.800
Why'd you do that little bit of kitten? Well I had to give it away because we already

02:35.800 --> 02:41.760
had two dogs in one cat. You mean you drew a number in one little kitten? Yes.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.280
I used a cute little kitten I saw him but I saw to agree with you that one around the

02:46.280 --> 02:54.280
house maybe enough. And Diane, this is our daughter Diane. She's not 12 years old and

02:54.280 --> 02:59.120
she goes to school. What are you going to do this summer Diane? Well I'm planning to go

02:59.120 --> 03:04.640
down to Tennessee after camp and help my sister around the house. Want to help Linda

03:04.640 --> 03:09.800
what her own little house on Lookout Mountain? Well I hope that we just got our house finished

03:09.800 --> 03:15.480
this last summer. We hope that as many of you as possible may come and visit us sometime

03:15.480 --> 03:22.120
when we were there. I believe you have a big job of feeding the dogs in the cat most

03:22.120 --> 03:28.440
of the time don't you Diane? Supposed to. Supposed to but and well Gail how are you getting

03:28.440 --> 03:36.480
along sweetie? Gail is nine years old and are you going to come down and travel around

03:36.480 --> 03:41.840
with us sometime this summer? Yeah well I got to camp first. And then I remember four

03:41.840 --> 03:47.680
years ago you went several places with Nancy and me when we were in our campaign and what

03:47.680 --> 03:53.880
you do in there when you went around. They're going your buttons. Put buttons on people.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.880
I remember you put a button on you try to give a fellow a button he wouldn't take one

03:57.880 --> 04:05.040
and what you do then. But I don't think it's good. Well that's a you were so little and

04:05.040 --> 04:09.480
you had to reach up and put it on the back of his coat but I guess this time you can do

04:09.480 --> 04:16.480
it a whole lot better. Well David what are you going to do when you got through? First

04:16.480 --> 04:20.320
where you're going to go to college if you pass your grades and everything? Well I'd like

04:20.320 --> 04:28.000
to go to the University of Tennessee because I believe that that has one of the best education

04:28.000 --> 04:34.360
for agriculture. You may hear. You're going to be a farmer? Down at Madisonville maybe

04:34.360 --> 04:39.440
one of these days. I bet you'll be a good farmer because you like to you're always willing

04:39.440 --> 04:48.600
to mow the yard which I don't do very often. And then Diane you're like your mother you're

04:48.600 --> 04:53.680
somewhat of an artist but what is it that you like to draw? Well I like to paint horses

04:53.680 --> 04:59.720
and that's about it. Well I guess we've been talking a whole lot about how Diane paints

04:59.720 --> 05:05.920
horses and then we did mention that you went down to the studio with mummy once in a while

05:05.920 --> 05:10.000
and we might have proud of something happened about your paintings though the day what

05:10.000 --> 05:17.600
was that? Well I saw two of my paintings and I got $2.00. Oh yeah that was wonderful.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.360
I don't think a little girl ever has been so excited is when somebody paid her $10 for

05:21.360 --> 05:25.840
a painting that's. $10 for two paintings. $10 for two paintings yeah that's for a half

05:25.840 --> 05:32.600
feet. She lost a paint. Like aeol's a model isn't she? You just like to paint? No she

05:32.600 --> 05:41.960
just paints like that. Well we have always have two good dogs and then Diane you want to

05:41.960 --> 05:51.280
tell us about telling our friends about our present dogs? Well one's of Cocker Spaniel

05:51.280 --> 05:55.720
and his name is Jo Jo. We've had Jo Jo a long time he's a pretty dog then what's the

05:55.720 --> 06:03.080
new one? It's the Irish setter and her name is Amber. They're certain they're fine dogs

06:03.080 --> 06:08.520
well I think maybe they were in the picture here a little while ago. I know that every morning

06:08.520 --> 06:14.800
when the mailman comes you a great big stack of mail for you and down in the office we

06:14.800 --> 06:23.040
got lots of mail from the people in Tennessee and you got a lot of mail what do they what

06:23.040 --> 06:29.040
kind of mail do you get and how do you answer it? Well I get I get a lot of mail from women

06:29.040 --> 06:35.240
intent throughout the state and I think their problems just about the same as ours are

06:35.240 --> 06:46.520
here I keep out quite a correspondence as you know and discuss our mutual problems of our

06:46.520 --> 06:51.240
children and our food and everything else. I know a lot of them right you about education and

06:51.240 --> 06:58.200
about how cost of living or about in fact they might be going to come to Washington. Of course

06:58.200 --> 07:04.760
you know we have many visitors from the state and we are constantly seeing people from Tennessee

07:04.760 --> 07:12.680
just last week we had over 20 women at the Democratic Convention here so that's a

07:12.680 --> 07:18.440
grand way to keep in touch with what's going on at home. I think the good people we are

07:18.440 --> 07:24.440
visiting whether people particularly the women might be interested in a typical day of yours in

07:24.440 --> 07:31.560
Washington Nancy what you do and what you have to do and what your activities are. Well of course

07:31.560 --> 07:38.680
once a week the Senate ladies meet and that's a busy and amusing day we get into uniform and go

07:38.680 --> 07:45.720
down to one of the rooms in the Senate and roll bandages and prepare squares and everything for

07:46.520 --> 07:52.040
the Red Cross. And do a lot of talking to us. We do a lot of gossiping exchange news about our

07:52.040 --> 07:56.600
various sections of the country and we take our lunch in a little paper bag and we got cup of coffee

07:56.680 --> 08:01.400
and it's very informal. David you're going to go out and campaign some of this this summer.

08:01.400 --> 08:07.160
Yes I hope to. And well you know a lot of boys in Tennessee because you've been over to

08:07.160 --> 08:11.320
highlight campus. I think you're one of the oldest campers over there aren't you.

08:11.320 --> 08:21.240
Yes sir. And what are you and Linda going to do when you got down to the house in Tennessee

08:21.240 --> 08:28.280
Diane. Well I guess mostly clean it up and. And all the grass and yeah well Linda's

08:28.280 --> 08:37.800
big enough to mold the grass isn't she. Well I mean we're planning to do just get ready for everybody.

08:37.800 --> 08:45.080
I know that Nancy has about the same problem that most all mothers doing connection with education

08:45.080 --> 08:53.720
I have to be aware a great deal and down at the office and Nancy has the job of taking the kids

08:53.720 --> 09:00.440
around to the girl scouts and to the brownies and to the boy scouts. It's the arithmetic homework.

09:01.240 --> 09:06.520
I wish you'd stay home more than that. To help with that. When I'm helping Gayle with her

09:06.520 --> 09:12.600
arithmetic see David and Diane are a jump ahead so I come out pretty easily. And then when I have

09:12.600 --> 09:19.320
to help David it's sometimes over my head. I remember you sent me a gave me a book on a 4-H

09:19.320 --> 09:26.840
club. Can I have been reading it since then. Yeah well I'm glad David is wants to be a farmer

09:26.840 --> 09:33.560
because we need more farmers but they've been having a many hard time as you know David but you'll

09:33.560 --> 09:37.640
be a good one won't you. I don't know whether you ever actually be one but he's never wanted to be

09:37.640 --> 09:42.440
anything else. Well I always want to be a lawyer I didn't know I'd ever be a politician

09:42.440 --> 09:48.200
whether you never can tell. Well ladies and gentlemen certainly has been good to

09:49.960 --> 09:57.480
visit with you on this occasion and I wish that our daughter Linda could be with us as well as

09:57.480 --> 10:04.440
David and Diane and Gayle and we'll all be around this summer and try to see as many of you as possible.

10:05.320 --> 10:12.120
Now that you have had a visit with my family I would like to spend a few minutes discussing some

10:12.120 --> 10:17.960
of the more pressing domestic issues facing our state and our nation and letting you know where I

10:17.960 --> 10:24.120
stand on them. Over the long haul one of the most serious unsolved problems is high prices.

10:24.840 --> 10:30.760
We have been in an inflationary spiral for years and prices have been going up almost constantly.

10:31.640 --> 10:36.600
If there is one group which does not need to be reminded of this fact it is the housewives.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.400
It is no consolation to them to be told that inflation has been slowed down.

10:42.200 --> 10:48.280
Prices still inch up almost every month and the net result over the years is indeed shocking.

10:49.160 --> 10:55.400
The causes of our inflationary spiral are very complex and I won't try to oversimplify the problem

10:56.120 --> 11:00.280
but one of the major causes is what the economist called administered prices.

11:00.840 --> 11:06.440
We layman normally think of them as collusive prices. What it amounts to is that a particular

11:06.440 --> 11:12.440
industry may be monopolized by a few huge companies which then rigged the prices to eliminate

11:12.440 --> 11:18.920
competition and to assure extra high profits. Such practices could not be more contrary to the

11:18.920 --> 11:25.480
basic concepts underlying our free enterprise system. I've held a number of hearings on monopolies

11:25.560 --> 11:30.280
in some of our industries where competition has been almost completely eliminated.

11:30.840 --> 11:35.240
The steel industry and the electrical industry are excellent examples.

11:35.880 --> 11:40.920
More recently we held a long series of hearings to show why the cost of drugs to the drug

11:40.920 --> 11:46.840
is so excessive and why the profits in the drug manufacturing industry are equally excessive.

11:47.480 --> 11:52.840
And I shall continue to press for legislation which will restore competition to those many

11:52.840 --> 11:58.040
industries which are now almost completely monopolized by a few huge firms.

11:58.760 --> 12:04.600
And I think that fiscal irresponsibility is also something against which we must always be on

12:04.600 --> 12:10.440
guard because it has something to do with inflation too. The Congress can and does make substantial

12:10.440 --> 12:16.440
savings. We made cuts in the proposed budget at places where we felt that it could be done,

12:16.440 --> 12:20.360
commensurate with the national security and the general welfare of the country.

12:21.240 --> 12:26.840
For many years I was a member of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and we were able

12:26.840 --> 12:33.720
to eliminate to make many savings by eliminating many of the overlapping activities in our military

12:33.720 --> 12:39.560
reorganization bill. Activities and waste which has been so common in the Pentagon.

12:40.600 --> 12:47.000
Another problem which is crucial in complex is the firm situation. This problem gets worse and

12:47.000 --> 12:53.320
worse each year. One of the favorite indoor sports throughout the country these days seems to be a

12:53.320 --> 13:00.120
game called Beat Ezra Tath Benson and he seems to be fair game for Democrats and Republicans alike.

13:00.840 --> 13:06.840
Well I think Mr. Benson has made a bad mess out of the firm situation but whipping him will not

13:06.840 --> 13:12.280
solve the problems. There are many people who do not really understand how bad things are with

13:12.280 --> 13:20.280
the average farmer. Very few non-farmers for example know that since 1951 the price of corn per

13:20.280 --> 13:28.360
bushel has dropped from 166 to 105 per bushel and this is a 37 percent decrease or the cut and see

13:28.360 --> 13:34.920
it is down 43 percent or the beef cattle are down 22 percent or the millions of people have been

13:35.560 --> 13:41.000
leaving the farms and going into the already crowded cities. I could go on and on

13:41.560 --> 13:47.160
but more figures would only underline the conclusion that the farmers are really in very bad

13:47.160 --> 13:53.480
streets and this is particularly true of the small family farmer. Well I've spent a good part of my

13:53.480 --> 13:59.800
22 years in Congress fighting for the survival of the small farmer and we must find ways to

13:59.800 --> 14:07.000
protect the income of the small family size farmer and also find a way to assure that all farmers

14:07.080 --> 14:12.600
get their fair share of the farm dollar. At the same time we must protect the taxpayer and the

14:12.600 --> 14:18.840
consumer. I do not pretend that this will be easy but I do contend that it can be done.

14:19.720 --> 14:24.920
One thing that I have urged is the establishment of a department of consumers and the federal government.

14:25.640 --> 14:31.560
We have departments of agriculture of commerce and of labor but we have no department to look after

14:31.640 --> 14:37.960
the interest of the consumers and every American is a consumer and a department to look after

14:37.960 --> 14:45.320
our interest as consumers is long overdue. In my estimation the third most serious domestic problem

14:45.320 --> 14:51.240
in the country today is that of providing first rate public schools to all of our children.

14:51.960 --> 14:57.480
Despite a massive effort on the part of states and local communities in building schools

14:57.480 --> 15:03.720
since World War II there is still a shortage of 140,000 classrooms throughout the country.

15:04.360 --> 15:11.720
There is also a shortage of 195,000 teachers. Everyone knows the old adage about a picture being

15:11.720 --> 15:18.520
worth a thousand words. Here is a recent cartoon by the famous Bill Maudlin which appeared in the

15:18.520 --> 15:26.440
Harold Rebun and which proves this point very neatly. The cartoon says, I'm not playing

15:26.440 --> 15:33.640
hooky, I just fell out. These shortages do not result from any lack of foresight or initiative

15:33.640 --> 15:38.520
on the part of local authorities. They are dear rather to the fact that our population is

15:38.520 --> 15:44.440
expanding at an extremely high rate and the fact that our local tax resources are stretched

15:44.440 --> 15:49.960
almost to the breaking point. It is for this reason that I believe that federal aid for education

15:50.360 --> 15:56.520
is vital. This aid can be given without any danger of federal control. The legislation has

15:56.520 --> 16:02.760
specific prohibitions on this point and it can be given in such a way that states decide

16:02.760 --> 16:07.720
how much of the aid is to be spent for school construction and how much for supplementing

16:07.720 --> 16:14.200
teacher salaries. Federal aid would be a particular assistance to states like Tennessee whose

16:14.200 --> 16:20.120
average income is below the national average. For every dollar paid in federal taxes paid by

16:20.120 --> 16:25.640
Tennessee and we would get back more than two dollars in federal aid and these are good national

16:25.640 --> 16:32.120
programs too. I have here a chart which was recently published by the Tennessee Municipal Association.

16:33.080 --> 16:39.320
It says federal grants in aid return two dollars and twenty two cents to Tennessee for every one

16:39.320 --> 16:46.680
dollar in federal taxes. It is a tremendous bargain for state with only two-thirds U.S. average.

16:46.680 --> 16:53.240
Well let's take for example here. Here is water pollution control. The total spent in Tennessee is

16:53.240 --> 17:03.000
4.52 million and Tennessee is paid for this program in Texas 1.9 million and let's take a hospital

17:03.000 --> 17:09.240
construction which means which means so much to especially smaller cities of Tennessee. The total

17:09.240 --> 17:18.360
received in Tennessee was 47.2 million and Tennessee ends for this program paid 16.4 million and then

17:18.360 --> 17:25.320
others are on down the land as you will see. As I said before the average is more than two dollars

17:25.320 --> 17:31.960
in aid for every dollar in taxes. This is obviously a great bargain for Tennessee but it's also

17:31.960 --> 17:38.200
beneficial to the rest of the country as the economic health of the country depends on the economic

17:38.200 --> 17:44.760
health of all of its sections. Well I've heard a number of people argue that federal aid to education

17:44.760 --> 17:51.240
is vital if we are to keep up with the Russians. Well this is true but I think that all American

17:51.240 --> 17:57.960
children are entitled to a first rate education even if the serious external threat did not exist.

17:58.520 --> 18:04.760
We are about far the richest nation in the world. We can certainly afford not only a decent education

18:04.760 --> 18:11.160
for our children but an excellent education. Well this chart when you saw it a minute ago you

18:11.160 --> 18:17.240
will notice that there is no mention of several very important programs. One of these is federal aid

18:17.240 --> 18:23.720
to depressed areas of which there are many in Tennessee. The Congress passed a bill to assist

18:23.960 --> 18:30.760
these blighted areas in their redevelopment but this was unfortunately vetoed and you also saw

18:30.760 --> 18:37.480
a few minutes ago no mention of a program for medical or hospital care for our agent, our senior

18:37.480 --> 18:43.480
citizens. We all know that this is a much needed program since a great proportion of our older people

18:43.480 --> 18:49.240
have greatly increased medical and hospital expenses when they are least able to pay for them.

18:49.960 --> 18:55.720
It is my hope and expectation that some adequate program that will give them some substantial

18:55.720 --> 19:02.760
relief may be enacted in the very near future. There are also a number of going concerns which are

19:02.760 --> 19:08.200
particularly interest to Tennessee and which are the subject of constant sniping in Washington.

19:08.840 --> 19:14.040
A good example is the Tennessee Valley Authority which is done more to revitalize the

19:14.040 --> 19:18.920
economy of Tennessee that anything else in the last hundred years well in our history for that

19:18.920 --> 19:25.320
matter. There are constant attempts by the public power interest either to chop it apart or at

19:25.320 --> 19:31.560
least to tie its hands. There are others who would destroy or limit the R.E.A. program which is so

19:31.560 --> 19:37.480
vital to rural Tennessee. I am quite certain that all of the attempts to destroy these worthwhile

19:37.480 --> 19:44.280
projects will ultimately fail but in a literal sense there must be a constant vigilance in both

19:44.280 --> 19:50.360
the houses of Congress and among our people who are affected if they are to remain vital and

19:50.360 --> 19:57.240
effective for our continued use. Another subject which has occupied my time and attention to a great

19:57.240 --> 20:04.440
extent has been the national difficulty and problem of juvenile delinquency. As chairman of the

20:04.440 --> 20:10.200
Senate subcommittee dealing with this problem we held hearings in various parts of the country.

20:10.840 --> 20:16.600
It was our object to enlist the cooperation of all government agencies, local, state, and federal

20:17.320 --> 20:23.400
and to coordinate their efforts with those of the parents, schools, and the churches. In a sense we

20:23.400 --> 20:29.640
were engaged in an educational process but in another sense we were engaged in a very important

20:29.720 --> 20:36.280
legislative process. We were able to get a new to get new laws enacted to tighten up the traffic

20:36.280 --> 20:42.600
in the control and the control of narcotics. We are now working on legislation to strengthen the

20:42.600 --> 20:48.440
hands of the post office department and the Department of Justice in their battle against smut and

20:48.440 --> 20:54.440
obscenity. The Senate passed a bill for aid to the states and the training of personnel to combat

20:54.600 --> 21:01.720
juvenile delinquency. We also want to establish forestry camps which we believe are superior to juvenile

21:01.720 --> 21:07.960
homes for many types of delinquents. Well as important as these domestic problems may be

21:08.680 --> 21:13.960
I am sure that all of you are aware of the equal seriousness of our international situation.

21:14.840 --> 21:20.600
A permanent peace is something which we are yet to achieve. Meanwhile we must keep our country

21:20.600 --> 21:27.160
both militarily and economically strong. One of our greatest sources of strength is the unity

21:27.160 --> 21:33.480
of the Atlantic community, especially the cooperation which has been achieved within the NATO

21:33.480 --> 21:40.440
and the NATO nations. As long as the NATO countries stand together, war is unlikely because the

21:40.440 --> 21:45.880
communists know that we would win any war that they started. I have attended many meetings of the

21:45.880 --> 21:52.600
NATO parliamentarians who are the legislators from all of the NATO countries. I have worked for

21:52.600 --> 21:58.920
the establishment of the Atlantic Congress which was held last June from which we hope to get a

21:58.920 --> 22:05.880
more closely knit economic community in this part in this area of the world. Such a community could

22:05.880 --> 22:11.640
more fully share the cost of foreign aid which we have supported almost alone for many years now.

22:12.440 --> 22:16.520
There are a number of other subjects which I should like to discuss with you but I have already

22:16.520 --> 22:22.440
presumed upon your patience. Again let me say how sorry I am not to be with you in person on this

22:22.440 --> 22:27.800
occasion and let me thank you very much for letting me visit with you on this film.
