WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
This is Senator Estes' key for them.

00:07.760 --> 00:12.160
I hope that you will all circle your calendar for May 10th.

00:12.160 --> 00:16.920
The occasion is the Percipes Memorial Dinner to be held that evening in the Maxwell House

00:16.920 --> 00:18.720
in Nashville.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.920
Sam Rayburn, the speaker of the House of Representatives who himself is a Tennessean,

00:23.920 --> 00:25.960
will be the honored guest.

00:25.960 --> 00:31.640
The dinner is for a very worthy cause, a new public school in Nashville.

00:31.640 --> 00:37.480
And it will honor the memory of a great and good man, a fine Tennessean, Percy Priest.

00:37.480 --> 00:42.120
Thank you very much.

00:42.120 --> 00:55.580
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I want to discuss with you today the builds

00:55.580 --> 00:59.600
approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and sponsored by Senator William General of

00:59.600 --> 01:03.540
Indiana and John Marshall Butler of Maryland.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.500
These bills result from disagreement with Supreme Court decisions.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.180
They seek to overturn the decisions in various ways by limiting the jurisdiction of the court

01:13.180 --> 01:17.420
or by broadly rewriting statutes which the court has interpreted.

01:17.420 --> 01:19.500
I think they are very dangerous legislation.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.900
I have hoarded against them and I shall oppose them on the floor of the Senate.

01:23.900 --> 01:28.040
I doubt it bears a person in the United States who agrees with every decision the Supreme

01:28.040 --> 01:29.040
Court makes.

01:29.040 --> 01:35.820
Certainly, the justices do not always agree, sometimes split as five to four even among them.

01:35.820 --> 01:38.860
And neither do I always agree with the majority.

01:38.860 --> 01:43.020
Nevertheless, we made a decision in this country a long, long time ago.

01:43.020 --> 01:47.860
And that decision was that we would have three coordinated branches of government, the

01:47.860 --> 01:52.900
executive, the legislative, and the judicial, each acting as a check on the other.

01:52.900 --> 01:58.020
And I will be no party to the destruction or seriously crippling of any of these three.

01:58.020 --> 02:02.500
I do not have time to discuss with you fully all the implications of these amendments.

02:02.500 --> 02:06.420
Why would Senators General and Butler sought to do with their amendments?

02:06.420 --> 02:12.740
Why is to undo 150 years of legislative and judicial history with a sweep of the pen and

02:12.740 --> 02:15.580
without even waiting for adequate hearings?

02:15.580 --> 02:21.180
The bill denies a pellet jurisdiction to the Supreme Court over any law, rule, or regulation

02:21.180 --> 02:25.340
pertaining to admission of persons to practice law within the state.

02:25.340 --> 02:30.300
This results from disagreement with a decision in which a person who was a former communist

02:30.300 --> 02:35.700
but who had their repented was denied admission to the bar in New Mexico.

02:35.700 --> 02:40.360
It is not whether that the man who secluded the motion to deny the admission and who may

02:40.360 --> 02:45.260
have disagreed with the decision expressed his opposition to this bill of the Judiciary

02:45.260 --> 02:50.500
Committee, the president of the American Bar Association opposed it.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.660
The southern there is certainly all to oppose it.

02:52.660 --> 02:58.540
The last time bar membership was denied was by reconstruction governments after the war

02:58.540 --> 03:03.300
between the states and the Supreme Court upheld their right to membership.

03:03.300 --> 03:07.100
And another thing you remember that the only time jurisdiction has been taken away from

03:07.100 --> 03:14.700
the Supreme Court was in some of the Reconstruction Acts which other Congress passed and President

03:14.700 --> 03:16.540
Johnson vetoed.

03:16.540 --> 03:21.000
But the Congress of the United States just a few months after gave the jurisdiction back

03:21.000 --> 03:23.060
to the Supreme Court.

03:23.060 --> 03:28.060
But the most serious thing is that it sets a precedent of limiting jurisdiction to the

03:28.060 --> 03:29.220
Court.

03:29.220 --> 03:33.700
Under this line of reasoning every time you don't like a decision, the thing to do is to take

03:33.700 --> 03:36.820
another bit of jurisdiction away from the Court.

03:36.820 --> 03:39.740
This is a kill the umpire technique.

03:39.740 --> 03:42.420
Only here you would be killing him by degrees.

03:42.420 --> 03:48.180
Starting with a decision that he couldn't call balls and strikes and moving by degrees

03:48.180 --> 03:50.700
and to bases and fouls.

03:50.700 --> 03:55.660
The bill would give the Congressional committees the final determination of what is not pertinent.

03:55.660 --> 04:00.340
I've been chairman of many investigating committees ranging from the crime committee

04:00.340 --> 04:03.980
into the more complex fields of monopoly legislation.

04:03.980 --> 04:08.580
A good committee doesn't have to violate the bill of rights in order to conduct a thorough

04:08.580 --> 04:10.260
investigation.

04:10.260 --> 04:14.260
And I want the courts to remain as referees over committees.

04:14.260 --> 04:23.340
Another section of the bill gives the states a right to say what shall be a subversive

04:23.340 --> 04:25.140
sedition against the United States.

04:25.140 --> 04:30.220
In other words, to give the states the right to enforce the laws of the United States.

04:30.220 --> 04:36.300
I think that state jurisdiction and federal jurisdiction ought to be kept separately.

04:36.300 --> 04:41.380
The last section of the bill attempts to undo the doctrine almost 50 years old that teaching

04:41.380 --> 04:47.580
or advocating the overthrow of the government must be accompanied by a clear and present danger.

04:47.580 --> 04:53.180
It broadens the base of such advocacy by saying in any way or by any means.

04:53.180 --> 04:56.780
This of course is aimed at the communists whom we all dislike.

04:56.780 --> 05:01.260
In my opinion, the best way to control them high is to keep them talking.

05:01.260 --> 05:05.940
And when you say in any way or by any means as the bill does, that could be by a letter

05:05.940 --> 05:08.980
of speech and editorial or a careless word.

05:08.980 --> 05:11.820
And it doesn't necessarily mean a communist word.

05:11.820 --> 05:17.260
It might be an editorial advice and defiance of the court's school decision.

05:17.260 --> 05:21.780
You see, when you begin to impinge on liberty a little bit, you sometimes find that you

05:21.780 --> 05:24.340
have stepped on it all together.

05:24.340 --> 05:28.580
We've grown to be a great country by speaking and acting freely.

05:28.580 --> 05:32.740
A quick and easy way to become second-rate is to limit our basic freedoms of thought,

05:32.740 --> 05:35.940
of speech, of press, of religion, and of action.

05:35.940 --> 05:38.940
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

05:48.420 --> 05:54.460
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, one of the great problems and also quite an

05:54.460 --> 05:59.420
issue before the Congress, I suppose, one of the biggest issues we have before this

05:59.420 --> 06:05.340
Congress, because it is highly controversial, is the proposed reorganization of the defense

06:05.340 --> 06:10.140
department as recommended by President Eisenhower.

06:10.140 --> 06:14.900
And we have here to discuss the matter with us today and to answer some questions, General

06:14.900 --> 06:16.900
John Howe.

06:16.900 --> 06:22.060
General Howe is an old friend of mine of House of Representatives Bays and a Bays here

06:22.060 --> 06:23.060
in the Senate.

06:23.060 --> 06:25.460
He has lots of friends in Tennessee.

06:25.460 --> 06:31.300
And as a special assistant to Secretary of Defense, Michael Roy, he is taking the lead and

06:31.300 --> 06:35.380
presenting the administration's plan for the reorganization of the defense department.

06:35.380 --> 06:38.340
He certainly had led the heavy-widdest, General Howe.

06:38.340 --> 06:41.660
And what about this reorganization plan?

06:41.660 --> 06:43.660
What's the importance of?

06:43.660 --> 06:50.820
Senator, I considered a very real privilege to have the opportunity of appearing with you

06:50.820 --> 06:52.820
on this program.

06:52.820 --> 06:59.580
And I am delighted that it is an opportunity which is an indication of a long personal

06:59.580 --> 07:03.820
friendship which I have been privileged to enjoy for a good many years.

07:03.820 --> 07:08.500
Well, both as a member of the armed services committee and personally, it's been wonderful

07:08.500 --> 07:10.980
to work with you all of these years.

07:10.980 --> 07:11.980
Thank you, Senator.

07:11.980 --> 07:15.140
I don't think it's one of the highest privileges.

07:15.140 --> 07:22.460
As you are aware, the Department of Defense is the largest of the executive departments.

07:22.460 --> 07:28.740
It's, incidentally, General Howe, just how much are we spending on defense every year?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.500
What part of our tax dollar in Hamilton?

07:30.500 --> 07:36.540
In round numbers, our expenditures presently are running about $40 billion a year.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.780
That doesn't include mutual security.

07:38.780 --> 07:40.620
That does not include mutual security.

07:40.620 --> 07:47.100
That you include all items which could be properly charged to defense of the United States

07:47.100 --> 07:48.820
and of the free world.

07:48.820 --> 07:54.380
It runs nearly 80 cents out of every dollar paid by the people of the United States.

07:54.380 --> 07:57.620
You mean 80 cents of every tax dollars?

07:57.620 --> 08:00.060
The viewers and listeners don't really that.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.820
It isn't close to defense.

08:01.820 --> 08:05.940
But that's a better indication of understanding it because I never could understand just

08:05.940 --> 08:07.460
what $40 billion meant.

08:07.460 --> 08:11.300
It's too big a sum to the average individuals understand.

08:11.300 --> 08:17.180
Now that is an indication of why we feel that our organization must be such that it's

08:17.180 --> 08:25.980
not only is prepared to respond promptly, efficiently, to any enemy threat to our country or

08:25.980 --> 08:32.540
to the free world, but we also must be so organized that to guarantee to the people of the

08:32.540 --> 08:35.940
United States that we're not going to waste that money.

08:35.940 --> 08:41.740
That we're going to get the maximum amount of defense out of every dollar which they

08:41.740 --> 08:42.740
provide for us.

08:42.740 --> 08:50.700
But how come that waste issue is that we all know that the expenses, expenses, and bound

08:50.700 --> 08:55.740
to be wasteful, seems to me this reorganization would help us save us money.

08:55.740 --> 08:56.740
We certainly don't know.

08:56.740 --> 09:00.540
It is not a question of conscious waste, but it's a question of efficiency.

09:00.540 --> 09:08.640
It's efficiency of organization and of administration in order that we can respond with the maximum

09:08.640 --> 09:17.000
military efficiency which in turn through proper and efficient administration will actually

09:17.000 --> 09:19.860
result in a maximum of savings.

09:19.860 --> 09:26.440
Now I'm afraid Senator that I must say that the dollar savings will not be reflected

09:26.440 --> 09:32.320
in future budgets because as we go to new weapons they are fantastically expensive.

09:32.320 --> 09:38.380
But we hope that while there will be continued requirement for very large sums of money

09:38.380 --> 09:46.840
that we have to ask Congress to appropriate that we can through a better organization demonstrate

09:46.840 --> 09:53.940
a more effective use of that money both in administration and in actually producing

09:53.940 --> 09:55.280
defense for our country.

09:55.280 --> 10:00.080
Well, as I know how now in connection with the services the Air Force, the Navy, and the

10:00.080 --> 10:06.480
Army it doesn't abolish the separate services but attempts to fully unify them.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.480
Is that correct?

10:07.480 --> 10:08.480
I would say yes.

10:08.480 --> 10:17.460
What we are trying to do is to retain the very real assets which are inherent in the

10:17.460 --> 10:20.880
pride of service such as in the old Army units.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.920
I wish that we could discuss this program long time.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.720
I just want to say that I feel generally that there is a great deal of merit in the

10:28.720 --> 10:31.120
presence of the organization's program.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.880
I hope some program will be passed.

10:32.880 --> 10:47.960
Thank you very much General Howard and that's all friends until next week.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.640
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.840
Very shortly now the House of Representatives will consider the bill to extend the reciprocal

10:54.840 --> 10:56.520
trade agreements.

10:56.520 --> 11:01.120
This measure faces heavy opposition in the House and there's opposition also in the United

11:01.120 --> 11:02.760
States Senate.

11:02.760 --> 11:07.280
The House has just completed consideration and passage of the foreign aid bill and that

11:07.280 --> 11:10.640
legislation will soon be before the Senate also.

11:10.640 --> 11:15.720
I mention these two measures because they are of such overriding importance and the developing

11:15.720 --> 11:21.200
climate of opinion as a result of unfortunate incidents abroad will undoubtedly throw more

11:21.200 --> 11:23.480
hurdles into their paths.

11:23.480 --> 11:29.080
I am thinking of Vice President Nixon's unfortunate reception in Latin America of the burning

11:29.080 --> 11:35.200
of USI libraries in the Middle East and of the confused conditions in France.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.720
It is unfortunate that these things happen at any time but the worst thing we could do in

11:39.720 --> 11:44.680
retaliation would be to withdraw into our shell and ignore the interest of the people of

11:44.680 --> 11:47.800
Latin America or the rest of the world.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.880
I think no one will seriously challenge my belief that it is of critical importance that

11:51.880 --> 11:55.160
we retain strong allies throughout the world.

11:55.160 --> 12:00.680
We cannot adopt the policy of going at a loan in our struggle with international communism.

12:00.680 --> 12:05.360
It isn't easy to be a world leader but history has given us that position.

12:05.360 --> 12:11.200
Without allies we would exhaust ourselves in military preparedness and we would see the

12:11.200 --> 12:17.400
communist world expand by enveloping most of those nations who formerly stood with us.

12:17.400 --> 12:22.040
The Latin American nations have stood with us all the way through and France is the key

12:22.040 --> 12:27.160
stone to Western Europe without which we cannot contain communism.

12:27.160 --> 12:32.140
All of us I am sure it will be more easily concerning France with a fear showing by General

12:32.140 --> 12:38.200
Degas that he will not throw this unhappy country into a state of civil war.

12:38.200 --> 12:45.200
If the President of France will now take its vote of strength and strengthen its constitution

12:45.200 --> 12:51.800
and courageously tackle the problems of France then I believe that crises will be weathered

12:51.800 --> 12:56.160
and the nation will emerge stronger and more democratic than ever.

12:56.160 --> 13:01.120
What will happen if the generals in Algeria are not curved as anyone's guess?

13:01.120 --> 13:06.240
Latin America hasn't passed not only been one of our staunch supporters in every war but

13:06.240 --> 13:11.440
it has also been one of our best customers in times of peace and one of our best sources

13:11.440 --> 13:13.200
of products we need.

13:13.200 --> 13:19.920
The Trojum copper layered zinc, manganese, nickel, tungsten and such useful but less vital

13:19.920 --> 13:24.920
commodities as coffee and bananas all come from Latin America.

13:24.920 --> 13:29.680
In addition United States citizens have private investments in a book value around 8 billion

13:29.680 --> 13:32.160
dollars in Latin America.

13:32.160 --> 13:36.920
But a pure self interest therefore it is well for us to look beneath the surface of the

13:36.920 --> 13:42.080
riots and the troubles and determine what might be done to better our relations.

13:42.080 --> 13:47.000
They were once very good when our own Tennessee and Cordell Hall inaugurated the good neighbor

13:47.000 --> 13:52.920
policy and made a trip through South America where he was received with great good will.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.480
They continued good.

13:54.480 --> 13:59.440
Henry Wallace when he was vice president and more lately Dr. Milton Asenhauer the president's

13:59.440 --> 14:00.760
brother.

14:00.760 --> 14:04.880
He also record received on good will trips to Latin America.

14:04.880 --> 14:09.080
I'm glad that a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has begun to study

14:09.080 --> 14:14.600
to determine what brought about the deterioration in relations and what can be done about it.

14:14.600 --> 14:19.040
Whatever brought it about and I am certain that restricted trade, a lack of capital for

14:19.040 --> 14:24.400
development, the meddling of the communist, unfortunate relations we have had in the past

14:24.400 --> 14:28.240
with some South American dictators all played a part.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.640
I'm sure that the feet are crippling of the reciprocal trade bill and the foreign aid

14:32.640 --> 14:35.040
bill will not cure it.

14:35.040 --> 14:41.240
We must remember also that the lot of the leader of the world is not always a popular one.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.360
We remember when Britain ruled the waves and was the leader of the world.

14:45.360 --> 14:49.840
A popular pastime consisted in twisting the line's tail.

14:49.840 --> 14:55.840
Nevertheless, Britain had the respect of the world and it is for that which we must strive.

14:55.840 --> 15:00.080
And we will never attain that respect or retain our leadership.

15:00.080 --> 15:05.320
If our policies vacillate or if we blow hot and cold in such vital measures as reciprocal

15:05.320 --> 15:10.160
trade, we must expect and be prepared for the long pull.

15:10.160 --> 15:16.040
And we will as a result neither be over-related by temporary successes or overly discouraged

15:16.040 --> 15:18.000
by temporary setbacks.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.920
If we follow this kind of program, we will really be in a position to work for our peace

15:23.920 --> 15:25.920
and for dignity in the world.

15:25.920 --> 15:30.920
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

15:30.920 --> 15:44.320
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this has been a great week and as far as

15:44.320 --> 15:48.920
atomic energy use is concerned here in the United States.

15:48.920 --> 15:55.480
This week the shipping port atomic energy plant was put into operation putting electricity

15:55.480 --> 15:57.280
on the land.

15:57.280 --> 16:04.640
And this week the skip jack, the new atomic submarine was launched at New London Connecticut.

16:04.640 --> 16:11.240
These two things and they are submarine program and are a nuclear reactor electric program

16:11.240 --> 16:17.680
have been made possible by the unusual ability to driving force the determination of one

16:17.680 --> 16:20.480
naval officer in the United States.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.000
And that man is with us today.

16:22.000 --> 16:28.600
I am very happy to present to you listeners Admiral Hammond Rickover who is responsible

16:28.600 --> 16:36.040
for the atomic submarine and the main development that made the shipping port plant possible.

16:36.040 --> 16:41.600
Admiral is good to have you with us and we certainly would appreciate if you tell us something

16:41.600 --> 16:48.600
about the submarine atomic submarine program and then also the shipping port plant a little

16:48.600 --> 16:50.240
later on.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.800
I got my start in your home states another at Oak Ridge.

16:53.800 --> 17:00.600
The Navy sent me to Oak Ridge in 1946 together with a group of naval officers and civilians

17:00.600 --> 17:02.600
to study about atomic energy.

17:02.600 --> 17:10.000
And it was while we were there that we conceived the idea of the nuclear submarines and subsequently

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
the shipping port station.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.680
So we were very grateful to you for having such a fine state and since for being the birthplace

17:18.680 --> 17:19.680
of all of this.

17:19.680 --> 17:24.160
We are glad that these two great developments have their beginning and Tennessee under your

17:24.160 --> 17:26.400
direction Admiral Rickover.

17:26.400 --> 17:32.120
Now what was our first atomic submarine that you developed and was launched?

17:32.120 --> 17:34.760
The first submarine was the Nautilus.

17:34.760 --> 17:40.600
She was launched in 1954 and started operating shortly thereafter.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.080
She has now steamed more than 100,000 miles.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.840
Would you like to hear some of the records that you are asking?

17:46.840 --> 17:53.640
Yes, tell us about what the submarines have been accomplishing or the Nautilus.

17:53.640 --> 18:00.120
The Nautilus established the long distance record for a ship's things of marriage without

18:00.120 --> 18:04.440
surfacing last year and that was 5,000 and seven miles.

18:04.440 --> 18:10.880
Another very interesting and significant thing that she did was to stay under the ice for

18:10.880 --> 18:11.880
1,400 miles.

18:11.880 --> 18:17.320
She came within 180 miles of the North Pole and only gave up the venture because she

18:17.320 --> 18:21.480
had to engage in NATO exercises last year.

18:21.480 --> 18:26.600
How long did that mean the Nautilus was under the polar ice cap?

18:26.600 --> 18:32.120
She was under for five and a half days and waters that had never been traversed by any

18:32.120 --> 18:36.000
human being or by any vehicle made by human beings.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.120
But tell us about some of the accomplishments of the later atomic submarines.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.040
How many do we have now?

18:43.040 --> 18:50.080
We have a total of 23 either in operation or being constructed.

18:50.080 --> 18:55.240
Six of them including the Skipjack which you mentioned a moment ago have been launched.

18:55.240 --> 19:01.160
And the day before the Skipjack was launched, two of our submarines returned from another

19:01.160 --> 19:02.160
notable cruise.

19:02.160 --> 19:07.240
These were the sea wolf and the skate, the second and third of our submarines.

19:07.240 --> 19:13.520
I hear that when I'm going so fast you have to fast your seat belts in order to stay

19:13.520 --> 19:14.520
in it.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.760
Well I don't think it's quite that fast.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.120
I know you people from Tennessee are pretty fast but we're not quite as fast as that.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.200
Well anyway that's a good illustration of how fast we are getting with the comic

19:25.200 --> 19:26.200
submarine.

19:26.200 --> 19:32.000
Because these two submarines steam totally submerged for about 10,000 miles without surfacing

19:32.000 --> 19:34.880
and they were submerged for more than a month.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.680
Well I've ever come to the surface and this is a record which has never been eaten before.

19:38.680 --> 19:43.240
Well I'm on the Armed Services Committee and I know that all this has been possible because

19:43.240 --> 19:48.140
of the drive and the breaking through the red tape and the determination to get these

19:48.140 --> 19:50.600
jobs done by you Admiral Rickles.

19:50.600 --> 19:55.600
It's also due to the great help we get from understanding people such as you in Congress

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
and I would not be willing to be rolling efforts.

19:57.600 --> 20:02.880
Now tell us something about the shipping port plant we just have a few seconds left.

20:02.880 --> 20:08.440
In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission with a backing of Congress and the National Security

20:08.440 --> 20:13.000
Council decided to build a large scale central station power plant.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.480
The shipping port plant is that one.

20:15.480 --> 20:20.760
We built it in about the same time we designed it, developed it and built it in about the

20:20.760 --> 20:24.280
same time that it takes to build a conventional power plant.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.280
Well thank you very much Admiral Rick over.

20:26.280 --> 20:30.360
It's good to have you with us and we hope you'll come back to Tennessee again sometime

20:30.360 --> 20:31.360
soon.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.360
Thank you.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.360
Thank you.

20:33.360 --> 20:43.240
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

20:43.240 --> 20:49.800
One of the most important people in the federal government of the United States happens

20:49.800 --> 20:52.840
to have spent a great deal of time in Tennessee.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.760
He is the United States Commissioner of Education, Lawrence D'Earthick.

20:56.760 --> 21:02.480
For many years was the superintendent of education in the city of Chattanooga where he made

21:02.480 --> 21:04.480
a great record.

21:04.480 --> 21:08.320
He has many, many friends in Tennessee and I know his friends will be glad to see him

21:08.320 --> 21:10.320
on this program today.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.920
We are not proud of Commissioner D'Earthick.

21:12.920 --> 21:17.200
You're not only does things here but along with other educators you have been to the Soviet

21:17.200 --> 21:18.200
Union.

21:18.200 --> 21:22.600
So, study and to find out about their education system and I believe you came back before

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
yesterday, Laura.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.200
Yes, then back one day.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.640
Well, tell us about your trip and how long we're in the Soviet Union and what you find

21:29.640 --> 21:30.640
out about education.

21:30.640 --> 21:36.640
Well, Senator, first thank you for that gracious introduction and I'm glad to greet my friends

21:36.640 --> 21:39.520
in Tennessee on your program.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.160
We had a very intensive schedule.

21:43.800 --> 21:49.800
There were ten of us on this team outstanding the other nine at least were outstanding educators

21:49.800 --> 21:53.000
in the United States, the parties and their field.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.480
We were one of the first teams in the cultural exchange agreement signed between our two

21:59.480 --> 22:01.400
countries.

22:01.400 --> 22:08.040
We were therefore official guests of the Soviet Union and to be a guest of the Soviet Union

22:08.040 --> 22:13.600
is particularly significant because the doors are open and we were privileged to see anything

22:13.600 --> 22:20.680
we wanted to see and we traveled by a special airplane over many thousands of miles.

22:20.680 --> 22:28.240
Well, we went to after our studies in the Moscow area, we went to Kazan and the entire

22:28.240 --> 22:29.640
autonomous republic.

22:29.640 --> 22:35.760
We went over to Severed Lose in the Ural, the Pittsburgh of the Ural, and the Siberia

22:35.760 --> 22:42.240
and then we went down coast to our joining the Chinese border in Kazakistan and Almaha

22:42.240 --> 22:50.120
and then over to Taishkent, New Uzbekistan, alongside of Afghanistan and then over to Sochi

22:50.120 --> 22:51.760
on the Black Sea.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.440
Yes, I had a privilege of going there.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.920
That's the great bathing place.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.200
Yes, but we didn't have much bathing they put us to work.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.480
Well, Laurence, what were your outstanding impressions of these several weeks that you went

23:02.480 --> 23:03.800
all over the Soviet Union?

23:03.800 --> 23:13.000
Well, the outstanding impression of our team of 10 was almost frightening in the sense of

23:13.000 --> 23:18.600
our realization of the total commitment that that nation of 220 million people with their

23:18.600 --> 23:21.200
vast resources are making education.

23:21.200 --> 23:26.840
Well, what talk we saw them making is a real challenge to us here in the United States.

23:26.840 --> 23:36.680
Well, I should say it is that you see not only are there budgets for education adequate,

23:36.680 --> 23:43.280
they're building buildings very rapidly, their equipment is good, but every segment of Soviet

23:43.280 --> 23:46.320
society is tied in with the schools.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.480
That's the one-time thing they're putting emphasis on.

23:49.480 --> 23:53.840
They're betting on education to win the race for supremacists.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.600
And how about the teachers?

23:55.600 --> 23:59.840
When I remember when I was there three years ago I remember they were quite well-tieded.

23:59.840 --> 24:04.560
Yes, teachers are at the top of the scale.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.120
We did a lot of study on that.

24:06.120 --> 24:11.360
They're paid at the same as doctors, medical doctors and engineers.

24:11.360 --> 24:14.160
That is the secondary school teachers.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.000
The elementary teachers are slight nights below.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.200
The university teachers are at the top of the scale.

24:20.200 --> 24:23.040
But the high school teachers are paid as our doctors.

24:23.440 --> 24:29.880
Well, are they placing particular emphasis on science and technology or what about their

24:29.880 --> 24:30.880
general education?

24:30.880 --> 24:37.080
Well, they have a general education that of course emphasizes mathematics and science,

24:37.080 --> 24:40.720
but they also emphasize other fields too.

24:40.720 --> 24:48.160
And recently they're giving emphasis to really industrial education.

24:48.160 --> 24:53.000
Well, are they devoting more of their national budget to education than we are here?

24:53.000 --> 24:56.640
Well, it's very difficult to make that kind of comparison.

24:56.640 --> 25:02.080
I can say that the school people were never concerned and seemed surprised that our questions

25:02.080 --> 25:07.800
about budget, they have the money to pay these top salaries to provide the equipment.

25:07.800 --> 25:14.160
And on top of that industry and other agents are required to contribute.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.080
Well, Commissioner D'Earthick, I know that your friends and tennis players are glad to

25:17.080 --> 25:18.360
see you and to hear your report.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.160
I wish we had more time, but our time has run out.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.560
That's all until next week.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.560
Thank you very much.

25:30.960 --> 25:37.960
Friends, Senator Keith Ober of Tennessee, who was Democratic candidate firm of ice president

25:37.960 --> 25:44.440
of the United States in 1956, is so well known he needs no introduction anywhere in the United

25:44.440 --> 25:45.440
States.

25:45.440 --> 25:48.920
Senator, you and I served in the House of Representatives.

25:48.920 --> 25:53.120
I hope to be with you in the United States Senate, after next January.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.600
I welcome you today.

25:54.600 --> 25:59.440
Well, Steve Young, it certainly has a pleasure to be on this program with you.

25:59.440 --> 26:03.960
I remember so well when I first came to the House of Representatives back in 1940 and

26:03.960 --> 26:06.880
you were an experienced member.

26:06.880 --> 26:12.120
And then after your term then you resigned to go into the armed services of the United

26:12.120 --> 26:17.680
States and then you came back in 1948 and served on the Ways and Means Committee.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.160
I enjoyed the service with you in the House of Representatives.

26:21.160 --> 26:26.280
I think you did an outstanding job for the people of Ohio and the nation.

26:26.280 --> 26:32.240
Always when they, side of the plain people was up and they needed protection with a vote

26:32.240 --> 26:37.160
or needed someone to speak for them, you were always ready and willing to do so.

26:37.160 --> 26:41.520
So that I do hope you'll be with us here in the United States Senate.

26:41.520 --> 26:45.680
We have a lot of very important issues before the people of the United States and the Senate

26:45.680 --> 26:49.520
and your past experience and the House of Representatives.

26:49.520 --> 26:55.800
And I've kept up with your political and economic and social activity since that time will

26:55.800 --> 27:00.160
be of great benefit to the nation and certainly to our democratic cause.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.320
You and I almost invariably voted alike, Senator.

27:04.320 --> 27:09.760
May I ask you what do you consider some of the dominant issues in this campaign?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.680
Well, you talk about us voting alike.

27:12.680 --> 27:18.880
I know we always had the same general philosophy, but maybe you had not say too much about

27:18.880 --> 27:24.360
that, but I remember one thing that you're always in favor of keeping up the defenses of

27:24.360 --> 27:30.000
this nation, of keeping our nation strong and that you voted for appropriations for all

27:30.000 --> 27:36.440
of our armed services in order that we could have adequate strength to defend ourselves.

27:36.440 --> 27:42.400
I think the dominant issues in this campaign, Steve, is you so well know are that this administration

27:42.400 --> 27:46.080
came into power on two big ideas.

27:46.080 --> 27:50.640
First, they could run the business of the country better that they knew a lot about business.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.120
Well, they've failed in that.

27:53.120 --> 27:56.760
We've had more inflation every month by month and we've had the poor.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.760
We have unemployment.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.160
Our factories are not producing.

28:00.160 --> 28:05.440
We have a great deal of suffering and over 5 million people unemployed.

28:05.440 --> 28:11.520
The tight money policy has hurt the small business man, the farmer and people all up and

28:11.520 --> 28:13.200
down the line.

28:13.200 --> 28:19.680
So we need a democratic administration that will expand our economy, keep our people employed

28:19.680 --> 28:27.440
and see that we economically as well as other ways have full productivity.

28:27.440 --> 28:31.880
The Democratic Party has the leadership and the ability to do that and this administration

28:31.880 --> 28:33.960
has shown that it doesn't.

28:33.960 --> 28:41.640
The next second thing is that we supposed to be good in foreign policy, the Republican

28:41.640 --> 28:42.640
administration.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.400
Well, we've lost friends in the Middle East.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.880
We've lost them in South America.

28:46.880 --> 28:53.520
We've lost them in Asia and our North Atlantic Treaty organization has been calling apart

28:53.520 --> 28:56.360
and straining at the bits.

28:56.360 --> 29:02.480
So there isn't any reason why we can't be the leading nation in the world if we have

29:02.480 --> 29:07.440
an enlightened foreign policy that the Democratic Party will bring back.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.080
The two things the Republicans were elected on, they failed.

29:10.080 --> 29:15.040
I think the people know that and they are looking for Democrats like you to come to the United

29:15.040 --> 29:17.320
States Senate and help us get the job done.

29:17.320 --> 29:23.600
Well, of course, involuntary unemployment as you and I both know is a great moral wrong.

29:23.600 --> 29:31.680
And at the same time to have this ever spiraling upward cost of living, of flicking our people,

29:31.680 --> 29:32.680
that is the dominant issue.

29:32.680 --> 29:33.680
I agree with your senator.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.680
That is the dominant.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.680
And there's no reason.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.680
No reason why it should be that way.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.680
The tight money policy of this administration resulted in that.

29:41.680 --> 29:42.680
Good.

29:42.680 --> 29:43.680
We don't believe them.

29:43.680 --> 29:44.680
We have to be with you, old pal.

29:44.680 --> 29:48.680
Glad to see you.

29:48.680 --> 30:01.640
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, as chairman of the political

30:01.640 --> 30:08.080
committee of the NATO Parliamentarians conference, it has become necessary for me to attend a meeting

30:08.080 --> 30:16.600
in Europe this weekend to make plans for the Hague-type Congress of which all 17 NATO nations

30:16.600 --> 30:20.200
will attend and which will be held next year.

30:20.200 --> 30:24.600
I'm leaving Washington Thursday night for the meeting in Paris and will return Sunday

30:24.600 --> 30:25.600
night.

30:25.600 --> 30:29.800
At the meeting will be the president of the NATO Parliamentarians conference, Colonel

30:29.800 --> 30:35.040
Femmes of the Netherlands, Congressman Wayne Hayes of O'Hah, who is vice president

30:35.040 --> 30:40.160
of the conference, representatives of the parliament of all of the other NATO nations

30:40.160 --> 30:42.120
and myself.

30:42.120 --> 30:47.160
Also president will be representative citizens from all of the other NATO nations, distinguished

30:47.160 --> 30:49.840
people who are very much interested.

30:49.840 --> 30:53.440
As you know, NATO will be ten years old next year.

30:53.440 --> 30:58.320
During those ten years it has been the free works bulwark against communism.

30:58.320 --> 31:03.260
This partnership of free nations packs together the power that has made it possible to keep

31:03.260 --> 31:06.400
freedom alive and vibrant on this earth.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.960
Naturally we have not always agreed with all that our allies have done and they have not

31:10.960 --> 31:13.520
always agreed with what we have done.

31:13.520 --> 31:19.800
But together we have weathered many storms which otherwise might have sunk our nations individually.

31:19.800 --> 31:24.760
Next year we will be starting our second decade as a NATO alliance.

31:24.760 --> 31:30.040
At the meeting of the parliamentarians conference last November I sponsored a resolution which

31:30.040 --> 31:34.240
called for this Hig-type Congress in 1959.

31:34.240 --> 31:39.040
I felt that we ought to be planning our second decade and that in these plans we ought not

31:39.040 --> 31:44.120
limit ourselves entirely to the diplomats and representatives of the governments.

31:44.120 --> 31:48.760
We ought to tap the minds and imaginations of the people themselves.

31:48.760 --> 31:51.400
This resolution passed unanimously.

31:51.400 --> 31:57.040
This Congress will be held and the meeting this weekend is to make plans for it to decide

31:57.040 --> 32:03.480
where and when during 1959 it will be held and what will be done to Congress and so on.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.880
I am very excited about its prospects.

32:05.880 --> 32:09.840
There is nothing more important in this world than peace.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.360
Peace like everything else doesn't just happen.

32:13.360 --> 32:18.520
We have to work to bring it about and in the work we will have to tap all of our resources,

32:18.520 --> 32:21.840
all of our people who have contributions to make.

32:21.840 --> 32:27.040
We cannot let small things that divide us overcome the big things that unite us and the

32:27.040 --> 32:32.680
best way to prevent that is to freely discuss among ourselves both our differences and

32:32.680 --> 32:34.480
our aspirations.

32:34.480 --> 32:40.280
I shall tell you more of my observations of this very important meeting next week.

32:40.280 --> 32:45.120
Meanwhile I wanted to add on the domestic side that this past week in Congress has certainly

32:45.120 --> 32:47.080
been a very busy one.

32:47.080 --> 32:51.280
This is the season of the year when we began to see results of a lot of pains taking

32:51.280 --> 32:54.040
work that has gone earlier.

32:54.040 --> 32:58.160
I was pleased with some of the results obtained this last week.

32:58.160 --> 33:02.000
The Senate passed the appropriations bill for public works.

33:02.000 --> 33:08.320
I am happy to say that it included $75,000 to be used as planning money for flood control

33:08.320 --> 33:13.160
work in northwest Tennessee on the Forkett deer and the Obine Rivers where they have had

33:13.160 --> 33:16.680
so much rain and destruction for the last few years.

33:16.680 --> 33:20.040
This has been a very great problem for a number of years.

33:20.040 --> 33:25.040
And now that the local groups are organized it will be possible to get this appropriation

33:25.040 --> 33:30.120
and have the aid of the United States engineers in solving the very great drainage problem

33:30.120 --> 33:32.400
in that part of our state.

33:32.400 --> 33:37.880
Also there was $550,000 appropriation for continuation of the work on the Memphis

33:37.880 --> 33:39.000
Harvard.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
This will make possible the completion of the protection necessary on the Tennessee

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
River.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.160
So that this land, known generally as insulated bottoms, will be available for our industrial

33:49.160 --> 33:50.160
usage.

33:50.160 --> 33:56.400
Also in the bill it was $50,000 for planning work for the Melton Hill Dam to be built

33:56.400 --> 33:59.920
by the TVA on the Flint River near Oak Ridge.

33:59.920 --> 34:04.600
With this money and with the proceeds of the TVA self-financing bill which passed the Senate

34:04.600 --> 34:11.200
last year and which I hope will soon pass the House, TVA will be able to go forward with

34:11.200 --> 34:18.040
this new dam which will mean so much not only for power and navigation but also for recreation

34:18.040 --> 34:21.640
to the people around Oak Ridge and Clinton and Knoxville.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.400
It will be one of the best TVA dams.

34:24.400 --> 34:28.960
Also in the bill was money for the Barclay Dam or the Cheedham work on the Cheedham

34:28.960 --> 34:30.960
Dam and other work on the Cumberland River.
