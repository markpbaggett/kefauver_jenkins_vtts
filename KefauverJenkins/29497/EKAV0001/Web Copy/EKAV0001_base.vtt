WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.120
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we had a very historic occasion in the United

00:14.120 --> 00:19.920
States Senate this week when the two distinguished senators from the new state of Hawaii, the

00:19.920 --> 00:25.840
beautiful state of Hawaii, were introduced and sworn in as members of the United States

00:25.840 --> 00:31.520
Senate. And I'm very happy to have them here with me on this occasion to introduce them

00:31.520 --> 00:38.640
to the people of Tennessee. On my right first I will introduce Senator Haram Fong, who

00:38.640 --> 00:44.600
is the first person of Chinese descent who has ever been a member of the Congress. It's

00:44.600 --> 00:48.000
a great pleasure to have you on this program, Senator Fong.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.480
My pleasure, Senator Kifapa, to be here with you.

00:50.480 --> 00:58.440
Thank you. And we have a special interest in the Senator on my left, Orrin Long. He went

00:58.440 --> 01:05.280
to school at Johnson Bible College near Knoxville, Tennessee, and he came back as principal or

01:05.280 --> 01:13.040
superintendent of that college a sometime later. And he married a very lovely Tennessee

01:13.040 --> 01:18.200
girl, Mr. Geneva Rule. Sure he's good to have you, Orrin. Say something to the people

01:18.200 --> 01:22.120
of Europe. We consider you our third Senator, you know.

01:22.120 --> 01:30.080
Thank you, Esther. It's a great privilege to be here. Senator Long was the governor of

01:30.080 --> 01:39.480
Hawaii for time, and he is a member of the Democratic Party. When you're coming down to see us

01:39.480 --> 01:45.840
in Tennessee, Orrin, we expect to spend our vacation in Knoxville just as soon as the

01:45.840 --> 01:50.080
session adjourns. Well wonderful, I'll be right there. We have better place. I hope

01:50.080 --> 01:55.280
that you'll cool it off a little bit before we get there. Well it'll be cool in the

01:55.280 --> 02:01.080
mountains. That's right. And we'll go up to Goblinburg and Smoky Mountain National Park.

02:01.080 --> 02:07.960
Senator Fong, you graduated from Harvard Law School. You were a great lawyer, served

02:07.960 --> 02:14.600
in the Air Force in Italy as a major during the war. Air force in the second field.

02:14.600 --> 02:20.000
Yes. Have you been, have you ever been to Tennessee? Yes, I've passed with Tennessee

02:20.000 --> 02:26.560
approximately ten years ago on my way from New Orleans to Washington. On the train? Yes,

02:26.560 --> 02:31.320
on the train. Well we want you to stay longer this, I want you to come down and see the

02:31.320 --> 02:38.080
TVA and stay here for real visit sometime. Alex, how did, which one of you are the senior

02:38.080 --> 02:45.320
senator? How did you decide that? Well, send along, gave me the title. He flipped the

02:45.320 --> 02:52.200
coin and he yelled heads and tailed King. Is that right, Orrin? That's correct. Well

02:52.200 --> 02:58.160
and then we had a very unusual situation. You were just both elected as usual. It was

02:58.160 --> 03:03.960
a case of Alaska also as senators. Then you have, we had to go through a process of deciding

03:03.960 --> 03:09.280
which would be the, well you'd have a two year term, a four year term or a six year

03:09.280 --> 03:17.200
term. How was that decided? Send it along. That was decided by drawing. I, by a flip of

03:17.200 --> 03:24.680
the coin, I had the privilege of drawing first as between six years and a blank. I drew

03:24.680 --> 03:29.800
the blank. And so that's the long of the six years. I had no six years left on one

03:29.800 --> 03:38.680
year. So you have a six year term, Senator Fong, and then I had to draw as between the

03:38.680 --> 03:43.920
two year and a four year term. And luck was wet to me, I drew the four year term. Well,

03:43.920 --> 03:52.360
that's fine. So everybody's very happy about it. Well, Senator Fong is a Republican and

03:52.360 --> 03:58.560
Senator Long is a Democrat. Well, what's your impression about the United States Senate

03:58.560 --> 04:03.480
of the Fong? My impression that I've got a lot to learn. I'm going to keep up with it.

04:03.480 --> 04:08.080
I'm learning very, very slowly. Well, you go back to how long you win the Congress when

04:08.080 --> 04:11.920
the guests are well. If it ever gets over, I don't know when we get over. You think you

04:11.920 --> 04:15.840
can get over soon? A lot of no one's entered the lot. I don't know. I'm Fredrick's press

04:15.840 --> 04:21.240
and opinion. What's your impression? What are your plans for the future or? My outstanding

04:21.240 --> 04:28.040
impression is the Greek friendliness of the man and the one lady that makes up the membership

04:28.040 --> 04:35.040
of 98 or 98 constituents. Wonderful. I'm so cheated with him. That's very wonderful

04:35.040 --> 04:42.160
of you to say that. Well, I certainly appreciate you being on the program and happy to have

04:42.160 --> 04:46.680
introduced you to the people of my state. We'll look for you in Tennessee sometime.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.400
That's all until next week at this time. Thank you very much.

04:58.040 --> 05:15.800
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, as this broadcast is coming to you, the Senate

05:15.800 --> 05:21.020
Appropriations Committee, which I'm a member, is very busy considering a wide variety of

05:21.020 --> 05:25.480
projects which include many for Tennessee about six or seven subcommittees or meetings

05:25.480 --> 05:30.480
every day. The President's budget request included among other items the following.

05:30.480 --> 05:36.960
$153,000 for paving a portion of the Gatlinberg spur of the foothills Parkway and a lot of

05:36.960 --> 05:42.960
money for construction of the Parkway. $1,900,000 for the completion of the Gatlinberg

05:42.960 --> 05:50.560
bypass and about $730,000 for grading and improving work on a Natchez Trace Parkway in

05:50.560 --> 05:55.560
a little swan creek area. The budget also calls for the following flood control monies

05:55.560 --> 06:02.360
under the Mississippi River and tributaries. West Tennessee adraignage district $400,000.

06:02.360 --> 06:08.000
Wolf River channeled the version and flood controlled in Shelby County $500,000. And the Memphis

06:08.000 --> 06:14.480
Harbor Project $640,000. Last year, where the Congressman Everett taking the lead, we were

06:14.480 --> 06:18.920
successful for the first time in getting money to begin the work on the Oban and Forkadeer

06:18.920 --> 06:25.440
Rivers. This started channeled clearance and straightening to let the flood waters out into

06:25.440 --> 06:31.040
the Mississippi River. Much farmland and many sections of highway in the Dye's Berk area

06:31.040 --> 06:36.240
have suffered from these flood waters for many, many years. And please that the President

06:36.240 --> 06:42.440
has asked for another $400,000 to continue this important flood control work. And we will

06:42.440 --> 06:47.040
certainly push hard for it in the committee. The same is true of the Wolf River channeled

06:47.040 --> 06:51.000
the version work at Memphis. Cutting the new channel through the Mississippi, through

06:51.000 --> 06:55.120
to the Mississippi, will do much toward removing the unpleasant odors in the North Memphis

06:55.120 --> 07:01.520
and downtown area. It will also remove many acres of bottomlands in Shelby County from

07:01.520 --> 07:07.760
repeated flooding during high water stages. I might also mention here that the budget included

07:07.760 --> 07:13.320
$17 million for work on the bark bed dam. While this is being built in Kentucky, the benefit

07:13.320 --> 07:18.000
will spread through many sections of our state. At the northern portion where the impounded

07:18.000 --> 07:24.640
waters will back up and offer many miles of recreational shoreline and also transportation

07:24.640 --> 07:29.440
navigation. Now there has been no budget request for additional mileage and the interstate

07:29.440 --> 07:34.400
highway program to build a road from Nashville to Dye's Berk. But Governor Ellington has

07:34.400 --> 07:38.800
started, has stated that this is a much needed addition to the system and that he is working

07:38.800 --> 07:43.600
hard for it. And we will certainly exert every effort here to see that it is included in

07:43.600 --> 07:48.520
the system. It would provide a much needed link between the northern, northwestern portion

07:48.520 --> 07:54.440
of our state and the capital. It would also fill a yawning gap in our interstate system.

07:54.440 --> 07:59.400
The new section would be carried over the Mississippi River via bridge to connect to Missouri

07:59.400 --> 08:04.000
where the rest of the present plant interstate highway system. And while I'm on the subject

08:04.000 --> 08:08.480
of this interstate highway system, of course we want a good road from Memphis north to Chicago

08:08.480 --> 08:15.360
sometime. I've also learned from Bill Ferris, the Public Works Commissioner at Memphis,

08:15.360 --> 08:21.160
that the Bureau of Public Road is seeking to narrow the middle neutral strips in the Memphis

08:21.160 --> 08:28.280
and Shelby County marriage from 40 feet to 16 feet. I've already undertaken to put a stop

08:28.280 --> 08:34.600
to this. The 40 foot neutral strips are a sound investment. Future traffic loads will

08:34.600 --> 08:39.480
create the need for additional traffic lanes on these interstate sections. To have the

08:39.480 --> 08:44.840
40 foot strips now means that the new space will not have to be acquired at higher cost

08:44.840 --> 08:50.000
when the time for expansion comes many years hence. There are many other items on the appropriation

08:50.000 --> 08:56.640
docket now before us. I wish I could cover all of them in this brief time, but I cannot.

08:56.640 --> 09:03.400
I do want to mention the Cherokee National Forest, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and

09:03.400 --> 09:08.800
also the Fish Hatchery at Irvin, Tennessee. The budget only has far enough funds to maintain

09:08.800 --> 09:13.340
the present hatchery. I plan to offer an amendment which will provide for a complete

09:13.340 --> 09:18.920
overhaul of the Fish and Wildlife Service at Hatchery at Irvin. The additional amount I will

09:18.920 --> 09:24.760
seek would also provide for a biological program for the Smoky Mountain National Park. And

09:24.760 --> 09:29.640
that's it. And Mr. Worf said he would go along with this. All of these programs, whether

09:29.640 --> 09:34.520
they deal with keeping our national parks and forest and outdoor sports up to snuff,

09:34.520 --> 09:39.320
or whether they continue meeting needs of flood control and roads and highways are very

09:39.320 --> 09:44.840
important, not only to Tennesseans, but to our nation. And we will continue to see that

09:44.840 --> 09:48.360
they are properly provided for. Thank you very much until next week.

09:59.640 --> 10:06.320
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessean, today we are very honored in having with us

10:06.320 --> 10:12.720
an old friend of mine. They distinguished the senator from State of Pennsylvania, Senator

10:12.720 --> 10:18.560
Hugh Scott. Welcome to our program. And I know your friends in Tennessee will be glad

10:18.560 --> 10:24.600
to see you again, Hugh. Well, I'm delighted to be here as this. I appreciate the opportunity

10:24.600 --> 10:29.920
to talk to all your friends all over the state of Tennessee. Well, thank you. And for

10:29.920 --> 10:37.000
your information, friends, Senator Scott came to the House of Representatives in 1941,

10:37.000 --> 10:42.520
two years after I did. I had a nice office, which I moved out of about that time. I believe

10:42.520 --> 10:49.160
you mean? I got you right. I got my office. Then in 1948 and 1949, as you will remember,

10:50.040 --> 10:56.280
Congressman Scott at that time as the chairman of the Republican National Committee, succeeding

10:56.280 --> 11:07.040
our colleague and the Carolries of Tennessee. And then Senator Scott came to the Senate two

11:07.040 --> 11:14.520
years ago and is one of the leaders of the United States Senate. Friends of today, we

11:14.520 --> 11:19.840
want to talk for a little while about something that everybody is interested in. We all talk

11:19.840 --> 11:25.920
about juvenile delinquency and bad effects and bad influences upon children. One thing that

11:25.920 --> 11:33.520
we know about and everybody is trying to do something about is to stop the flow of indecent

11:33.520 --> 11:39.240
illicit, pornographic literature, which is being sent through the males and otherwise to the

11:39.240 --> 11:48.680
youth of our land trying to poison their minds. Senator Scott has introduced a resolution, which I'm

11:48.680 --> 11:55.480
co-sponsored, which I think is the most far-reaching effort to try to bring people together overall to

11:55.480 --> 12:00.320
do something about this problem that we have had in the Congress of the United States. Senator

12:00.320 --> 12:05.760
Scott, will you tell us about the resolution that you have filed? Well, as just the resolution

12:05.760 --> 12:11.840
authorizes and directs the president to call a conference to develop ways and means of controlling

12:11.840 --> 12:18.720
traffic in obscene literature and materials, it would have the president calling that conference

12:18.720 --> 12:27.200
a federal and state and local officials, representatives of city or civic organizations, persons

12:27.200 --> 12:33.960
who are primarily interested, it would call for the help of the office of the Post-Massage

12:33.960 --> 12:39.720
General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, advice from the Department of Justice,

12:39.720 --> 12:48.000
and would seek to attack this problem from every possible standpoint and come up with recommendations

12:48.000 --> 12:54.640
as to where legislation is needed. And I recall that in the first session of this Congress, you

12:54.640 --> 13:02.960
introduced Senate Bill 2562 and it was co-sponsored by a number of senators and that is one of the

13:02.960 --> 13:08.360
approaches which certainly has to be given serious consideration, which is the approach by criminal

13:08.360 --> 13:15.080
penalty and by increased penalties for the second and third offenses. And you certainly ought

13:15.080 --> 13:22.800
to be congratulated for having started the ball rolling over here. Now, in following up the

13:22.800 --> 13:28.600
impetus which you and your associates gave in this bill, it's my thought that we will also

13:28.600 --> 13:33.760
approach it from the standpoint of federal state cooperation, from the standpoint of education,

13:33.760 --> 13:44.480
of arousing and focusing public opinion, and from every other aspect which this study group could

13:44.480 --> 13:49.200
consider. Well, I want to say that as a former chairman and as a member of the juvenile

13:49.200 --> 13:55.400
delinquency subcommittee, we've been working on this problem and I think this is a, but it never

13:55.400 --> 13:59.760
has been brought together the local people, the state and the federal people and that's a

13:59.760 --> 14:06.560
your great effort. Incidentally, an internacy of the Federation, Federated Women's clubs have

14:06.560 --> 14:12.560
been doing a great job in civic organizations. But what is the outlook for this very plan?

14:12.560 --> 14:19.160
Well, I would, I have no reason to believe that there is any opposition. We are going to ask for

14:19.160 --> 14:24.760
hearings, the White House, I believe will take a favorable attitude to it and I'm very hopeful

14:24.760 --> 14:29.880
that something can be done. Well, I know the pushmaster general will because he certainly has been

14:29.880 --> 14:35.680
carrying on a great crusade and he's estimated this traffic to be $500 million a year which is

14:35.680 --> 14:39.480
terrible. Well, our time is up, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much, Senator Scott.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.480
Thank you very much, Senator. We'll see you again soon.

14:41.480 --> 14:58.360
Ladies and gentlemen, Friends of Tennessee, during the many years that I served on the Armed Services

14:58.360 --> 15:05.420
Committee, we had Dr. Ralph Lapp before us, one of our great noted nuclear physicists,

15:05.420 --> 15:11.180
a man who had much to do with the development of the A-Bomb who has written many books such as

15:11.180 --> 15:16.940
The Voice of the Lucky Dragon, new discoveries and I'm sure all of you are familiar with this

15:16.940 --> 15:21.180
imminent science. I've always wanted to have him on this program and we have him today.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.580
Certainly I'd like to welcome you here.

15:23.580 --> 15:33.020
Dr. Lapp, I have great knowledge and as much as anyone I know about missiles, atomic energy,

15:33.820 --> 15:39.580
whether we are following the right programs or not. So Ralph, tell us how we are getting along

15:39.580 --> 15:47.900
in connection with atomic energy and hydrogen energy, vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. What's happening

15:47.900 --> 15:55.980
in this race today? Well, then the race, which is the race for destruction almost, it's difficult

15:55.980 --> 16:02.460
to say one can ever really be ahead, but our present for defense policy is based upon a turn.

16:03.100 --> 16:07.100
Upon preventing the enemy from attacking us by the power to retaliate.

16:07.900 --> 16:12.220
And in that connection there's a great argument on Capitol Hill as to whether or not the United

16:12.220 --> 16:18.300
States actually has sufficient power. To my mind it is more a question of in the future two to three

16:18.300 --> 16:23.420
years from now, will the United States military forces be strong enough to deter the Russians?

16:23.420 --> 16:26.620
And I think that there are some very real doubts about this.

16:27.420 --> 16:31.420
Well, I've been interested in whether we are making the right decision in connection with having

16:31.420 --> 16:41.100
fixed bases for ICBMs and Atlas missiles or whether the Polaris, whether the A-submarine,

16:41.100 --> 16:48.780
atomic submarine with the Polaris missile offers us more defense and a better opportunity

16:48.780 --> 16:53.980
of retaliation in the event we were attacked. Well, I think that anything that is fixed in geography,

16:54.620 --> 17:00.700
that is especially on this continent is now vulnerable to attack. This wasn't originally the case

17:00.700 --> 17:04.860
because we didn't think these intercontinental ballistic missiles would be that accurate.

17:04.860 --> 17:10.060
Even if you harden the base nowadays and there are going to be 270 of these put in continental USA.

17:10.620 --> 17:17.420
And even if you harden these, the Russian missiles will be sufficiently accurate, 1962 and 1963

17:17.420 --> 17:22.060
when these bases are operational so that they can knock them out. And that means your deterrent will

17:22.060 --> 17:27.420
not be believable. It will not survive an enemy attack. Therefore, he may be able to get away

17:27.500 --> 17:34.060
with whatever he wants to. And how about the atomic submarine with the Polaris missile, which we

17:34.060 --> 17:39.660
all very much interested in? I think this is a very superior type of deterrent for one reason that

17:39.660 --> 17:44.300
it is difficult for the enemy to knock it out. In other words, it is survivable. Secondly,

17:44.300 --> 17:50.300
from the standpoint of being off the continent, it doesn't draw nuclear fire to the United States.

17:52.060 --> 17:56.860
Dr. Leopold, how are we getting along in connection with our rockets in our contests?

17:57.820 --> 18:02.060
Whether it's Soviet Union and rockets, and what should we do to catch up and to get ahead?

18:02.860 --> 18:07.980
Well, that's a big order for a very short end, I'll say this. We are behind the Russians in space.

18:09.340 --> 18:13.340
We are behind in a space race that we ourselves announced in 1955.

18:14.140 --> 18:20.220
We lack this rust. We lack the power of our rockets to put into orbit into space.

18:20.220 --> 18:25.260
The kind of things the Russians have been so successful in doing. We have not made up that yet.

18:25.260 --> 18:31.980
Furthermore, we have not been able to fuse together the military and the civilian aspects of the space race.
