If there is no object

13:37.200 --> 13:39.360
There will be a time

13:39.360 --> 13:42.320
Senator John Kennedy of Mexico

13:59.840 --> 14:02.720
This 39 year old senator from Massachusetts

14:02.720 --> 14:06.960
Who nominated to place the nomination at least even since yesterday

14:06.960 --> 14:11.360
Suddenly found himself near the vice presidential nomination this afternoon

14:11.360 --> 14:15.520
Only to see an elastement at switch of votes that victory go glimmering

14:15.520 --> 14:21.520

14:29.840 --> 14:39.840
Ladies and gentlemen

14:39.840 --> 14:44.560
Ladies and gentlemen of this presidential

14:44.560 --> 14:52.880
I want to place this opportunity first to express my appreciation

14:53.760 --> 14:56.960
And Democrats from all parts of the country

14:56.960 --> 15:00.240
So often saw a decent way

15:00.240 --> 15:04.800
Who have been so generous in time to me this afternoon

15:04.800 --> 15:08.960
I think that it proves as nothing else could prove

15:08.960 --> 15:15.440
But a strong and united party the Democratic party is

15:15.520 --> 15:25.840
Secondly I think what has happened today bears out the good judgment

15:25.840 --> 15:30.080
Of Governor Stevenson in deciding that this issue should be taken

15:30.080 --> 15:33.280
For the floor of the convention

15:36.480 --> 15:41.040
Because I believe that the Democratic party will go from this convention

15:41.120 --> 15:43.920
So strong for what we have done here today

15:43.920 --> 15:50.480
And therefore ladies and gentlemen recognizing that this convention has selected a man

15:50.480 --> 15:53.440
Who has campaigned in all parts of the country

15:53.440 --> 15:56.400
Who has worked entirely for the party

15:56.400 --> 16:00.080
Who will serve as an admirable running mate to Governor Stevenson

16:00.080 --> 16:03.920
I hope that this convention will make Estes Kefava's nomination

16:03.920 --> 16:04.800
unanimous

16:04.800 --> 16:06.800
Thank you

17:44.000 --> 17:48.240
