00:00.000 --> 00:10.960
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, a great constitutional question which I have

00:10.960 --> 00:15.820
previously discussed with you was in the forefront of consideration here in the Senate

00:15.820 --> 00:17.760
again this week.

00:17.760 --> 00:23.520
This question concerns what we as a nation can do in order to assure firm leadership.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.520
Should there be some future occasion when the President is not able to act?

00:28.520 --> 00:32.120
The Constitution itself is not clear on this subject.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.480
It says that in the event of the inability of the President to discharge the powers and

00:36.480 --> 00:42.760
duties of his office, and I have the Constitution here, the same shall the bar on the vice

00:42.760 --> 00:48.480
president, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation,

00:48.480 --> 00:52.240
or inability both of the President and the vice president.

00:52.240 --> 00:57.600
Declaring what office should then act as President, and such office should act accordingly

00:57.600 --> 01:02.880
until the disability be removed, our President shall be elected.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.240
Now you will see that the Constitution seems to talk of an acting President.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.680
We have as a matter of fact never had an acting President.

01:10.680 --> 01:14.960
Due to the President established by vice president John Talon.

01:14.960 --> 01:19.800
When he assumed the office of the President, see in 1841, after the death of President

01:19.800 --> 01:27.360
Harrison, he took the oath of office as President and contended that he was in fact the President.

01:27.360 --> 01:31.960
This President has been confirmed six times by every vice president who succeeded to the

01:31.960 --> 01:37.920
office at the death of a President, namely Phil Moore and Drew Johnson, author, Theodore

01:37.920 --> 01:41.320
Roosevelt, Coolidge, and Harry Truman.

01:41.320 --> 01:46.280
The fact that the President has been so firmly established that a vice president assumes

01:46.280 --> 01:52.480
the office of President, rather than the powers and duties of the office, has served to inject

01:52.480 --> 01:58.000
a great deal of doubt about what if anything can be done while a President is temporarily

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
disabled to do anything.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.600
In 1881, for example, during the 80 days of President Garfield's fatal illness, he performed

02:06.600 --> 02:10.640
but one single act, the signing of an extradition paper.

02:10.640 --> 02:15.200
The cabinet discussed what should be done, and although all agreed that it would be well

02:15.200 --> 02:20.040
for Vice President, author to act as President, a majority of them felt that he could not do

02:20.040 --> 02:23.960
so temporarily, so they decided to do nothing.

02:23.960 --> 02:29.400
And President Woodrow Wilson was ill almost the entire last two and a half years of his

02:29.400 --> 02:31.000
second turn.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.640
During this period, as all of you know, leaders of the Senate were refused permission to

02:34.640 --> 02:38.960
even see him to discuss the treaty of their side.

02:38.960 --> 02:43.840
The affairs of government were largely disposed of by decisions of the President's wife, his

02:43.840 --> 02:48.320
decision in the White House and certain members of the cabinet.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.600
The League of Nations was lost.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.200
28 acts became law without his signature.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.720
In more recent days, we have all known the concern occasioned by President Eisenhower

02:58.720 --> 03:02.840
when he had a heart attack and with his subsequent illnesses.

03:02.840 --> 03:07.640
And as a matter of fact, President Eisenhower has himself urged that something be done about

03:07.640 --> 03:08.960
this problem of disability.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.920
Thus, we have had plenty of warnings, and we have known for a long time that this is

03:13.920 --> 03:16.520
a problem that should be solved.

03:16.520 --> 03:21.880
In today's fast-moving world of satellites, missiles, and jets, and atomic power, we

03:21.880 --> 03:27.840
might someday find ourselves helpless as a nation in a crucial period unless we do solve.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.760
Whenever an attempt has been made toward a solution in the past, we have found ourselves

03:31.760 --> 03:36.240
arguing over the tales and eventually neglecting the problems.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.760
This year's Chairman of the Constitutional Amendment Subcommittee, I have conducted hearings

03:40.760 --> 03:43.000
on proposed solutions.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
This week, a bipartisan group of us, including a majority of the members of the Subcommittee

03:48.000 --> 03:54.440
and of the full Judiciary Committee, introduced a joint resolution which I think is a satisfactory

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
solution.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.920
I have the resolution here and is post-sponsored by quite a number of the leaders of the Judiciary

04:00.920 --> 04:02.720
Committee in the Senate.

04:02.720 --> 04:07.760
It is a constitutional amendment, providing the means by which the Vice President and

04:07.760 --> 04:12.960
temporarily assume the powers and duties of the office, and by which they can be reassigned

04:12.960 --> 04:16.320
and assumed in the event of a President's recovery.

04:16.320 --> 04:21.280
And should there be disagreement between the Vice President and the President as to his

04:21.280 --> 04:26.400
recovery, Congress by two-thirds vote would solve the question?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.400
This proposal was immediately endorsed by President Eisenhower.

04:29.400 --> 04:35.200
And I am hopeful that we can start the constitutional amendment on its ways so it may be acted

04:35.200 --> 04:38.320
upon by the legislators of the various states this year.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.000
It is very important that we do so.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.240
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

04:53.240 --> 04:58.760
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this weekend I am flying to Bond, Germany

04:58.760 --> 05:04.080
to attend a meeting of the Executive Committee of the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.800
It is a very quick trip and I will be back on the Senate floor Thursday morning.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.120
I feel that it is an extremely important trip.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.800
As you may remember, I was one of the United States delegates to the NATO Parliamentarians'

05:16.800 --> 05:22.280
Conference when it met in its annual session in Paris last fall.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.360
At this meeting I was elected chairman of the Political Committee.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.040
There was a great debate on the floor of the conference over the necessity of having

05:30.040 --> 05:35.800
some means of attaining greater unity among the members of the NATO Alliance.

05:35.800 --> 05:41.160
It would be surprising to have very, very strongly our allies feel about this subject.

05:41.160 --> 05:46.440
And I believe that many people here in the United States still feel to realize how very

05:46.440 --> 05:48.800
serious it is.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.880
Among our allies, the Suez problem is still strongly etched in their members.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.320
This Suez crisis almost wrecked NATO.

05:57.320 --> 06:02.040
At that time you will remember Britain and France to whom they oil through the Suez is even

06:02.040 --> 06:05.120
more important than it is to us.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.720
Along with Israel, the Suez Canal.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.040
We didn't even know there was going to be an attack and our nation ended up on the other

06:13.040 --> 06:16.360
side, on the side of the Soviet Union.

06:16.360 --> 06:21.480
Since in NATO we are all in an alliance together, all of whose members are supposed to support

06:21.480 --> 06:24.000
the other in matters of defense.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.880
You can see how serious a situation like the Suez is to the very basis and to the heart

06:28.880 --> 06:30.640
of NATO.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.880
And while we were meeting in Paris, while this very subject was being debated on the

06:34.880 --> 06:38.600
floor of the conference, we had another such incident.

06:38.600 --> 06:44.320
This one involved a shipment of small arms to Tunisia by Britain and the United States.

06:44.320 --> 06:50.760
At a time when the French thought that Tunisia was helping the Algerian rebel, in the retrospective

06:50.760 --> 06:53.840
time this seems like a small incident.

06:53.840 --> 06:59.360
But many of the great tragedies in wars of history have been caused by small incidents.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.800
And once again, it could have been avoided if there had been proper consultation among

07:03.800 --> 07:05.960
various allies.

07:05.960 --> 07:11.080
From all of this debate, the Political Committee, at the NATO Parliamentarians' conference,

07:11.080 --> 07:16.680
produced a resolution calling for a two-pronged study of ways by which greater unity might

07:16.680 --> 07:22.400
be obtained on the political and economic side of our NATO problems.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.960
The manner by which this resolution might be made effective is one of the subjects of

07:26.960 --> 07:32.120
the Executive Committee meeting in Bonn on Monday and Tuesday of this week.

07:32.120 --> 07:37.040
That is why it's necessary for me as one of the authors of the resolution and as chairman

07:37.040 --> 07:40.320
of the Political Committee to be an attendant.

07:40.320 --> 07:45.080
The resolution calls for the appointment of a citizen's conference, composed of leading

07:45.080 --> 07:48.360
private citizens from all of the 17 NATO nations.

07:48.360 --> 07:54.000
To make a thorough study of this problem and to recommend to their respective nations

07:54.000 --> 07:57.200
as well as the NATO, what might be done.

07:57.200 --> 08:01.600
I would think of their study as something akin to the Hoover Commission's studies.

08:01.600 --> 08:06.240
These citizens on the Hoover Commission made some far-reaching recommendations which

08:06.240 --> 08:10.280
has done a great deal for the government here in the United States.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.680
Most of their recommendations were found feasible and were adopted by Congress.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.680
Some few weren't.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.520
So it would be with the citizens' conference.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.280
We have nothing to lose, much to gain.

08:21.280 --> 08:26.080
The second prong of this proposal would be a hay-piped conference of citizens meeting

08:26.080 --> 08:32.800
in 1959, the 10th anniversary of NATO, and discussing the recommendations of the citizens'

08:32.800 --> 08:39.920
conference, bringing the meeting of NATO home to every citizen in all of our countries.

08:39.920 --> 08:45.360
This is something that needs to be done in the schools at the Civic Club, and in wherever

08:45.360 --> 08:50.440
people talk so that they understand the meaning and the importance of NATO.

08:50.440 --> 08:55.640
I hope that some concrete progress toward getting these conferences underway will be accomplished

08:55.640 --> 08:57.760
at this meeting this week.

08:57.760 --> 09:03.240
After the bond meeting, the President of the NATO conference, Colonel JJ Fenns of the Netherlands,

09:03.240 --> 09:08.600
Mr. Jeffrey D. Freighties, a member of Parliament of Great Britain and I, are scheduled to have a

09:08.600 --> 09:15.080
conference with Mr. Paul Unraised back, the Secretary of NATO about the same problem.

09:15.080 --> 09:19.080
You know, in an alliance like NATO, which is the greatest hope of the free world against

09:19.080 --> 09:23.960
communist aggression, all of the members, all of all of the countries are in the same

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
canoe, so to speak.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.720
We therefore have to paddle in the same direction.

09:28.720 --> 09:33.640
Our efforts will be to get all of the pedals operated by the Americans that British,

09:33.640 --> 09:38.160
the French, and the Netherlands, and so on, operating in unity.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.840
I hope that we can do it.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.640
Thank you, and goodbye until next week.

09:49.080 --> 10:00.280
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I just returned from the meeting I discussed

10:00.280 --> 10:06.760
with you last week, the meeting of the Executive Committee of the NATO Parliamentarians' conference.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.600
As you may remember, one of the principal things to be discussed at this meeting, which was

10:10.600 --> 10:16.880
held in Bonn, Germany, was the arrangement for a possible citizens' conference, composed

10:16.880 --> 10:23.600
of representatives of all of the 15 NATO nations to be held later this year.

10:23.600 --> 10:30.400
And then later on, a Hague-type conference to be held in 1959 on the 10th anniversary of

10:30.400 --> 10:31.400
NATO.

10:31.400 --> 10:36.080
The reason that I was in attendance is because I'm chairman of the political committee of

10:36.080 --> 10:41.920
the conference, which produced these proposals, designed to explore ways and means to bringing

10:41.920 --> 10:48.080
the NATO nations closer together in a political and economic way for the protection of our

10:48.080 --> 10:49.080
freedom.

10:49.080 --> 10:54.240
The parliamentarians, as you know, are a body which recommends to the member government.

10:54.240 --> 11:00.160
It doesn't have the power to act itself, except in a limited capacity.

11:00.160 --> 11:05.920
Nevertheless, composed as it is of representatives of the people elected in their various countries

11:05.920 --> 11:12.000
to serve in their own congresses or parliament, it reflects public opinion of the countries

11:12.000 --> 11:13.800
pretty well.

11:13.800 --> 11:19.040
After discussing me proposed meetings ourselves and finding considerable sentiments at the

11:19.040 --> 11:25.200
plan she'd go forward, several of us met in Paris with tall, unraised facts, because

11:25.200 --> 11:29.240
of them of NATO, the great man of Belgium, as you know.

11:29.240 --> 11:35.680
As he's the representative of the executive end of NATO's photospeed.

11:35.680 --> 11:40.080
We talked with him first about the proposed citizens conference.

11:40.080 --> 11:46.620
This would be a relatively small group, 50 or 60, citizens from all of the NATO nations

11:46.620 --> 11:52.440
who would study and meet and meet together as long as necessary to find out the reasons

11:52.440 --> 11:59.840
for the things that divide us and recommend ways and means of solving these problems.

11:59.840 --> 12:06.080
This is back promised to present this proposal to the next council meeting of NATO in April.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.640
If enough member government show that they want it, then I think this step, which I believe

12:10.640 --> 12:15.720
to be of great and overriding importance, may be a fact she is.

12:15.720 --> 12:22.600
We then talked to Mr. Spack about the congress meeting in 1959, and he promised also to present

12:22.600 --> 12:26.120
that proposal to the next council meeting.

12:26.120 --> 12:32.280
This proposed congress would be modeled along the lines of the Hague Conference of 1948,

12:32.280 --> 12:36.160
which was inspired by that great leader Winston Churchill.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.920
The Hague Conference resulted in the Council of Europe.

12:39.920 --> 12:46.480
No one can promise in advance what this one would achieve, but we can hope and believe

12:46.480 --> 12:52.240
that it would be the same kind of imaginative step for the good of free men.

12:52.240 --> 12:57.720
As a result of all of these conferences, Colonel JJ Fenns of the Netherlands, the President

12:57.720 --> 13:03.320
of the Parliamentarians, will upon a small group study the report of the so-called

13:03.320 --> 13:09.440
three wise men and see what has happened in recent years since they met and study these

13:09.440 --> 13:12.000
problems of working together.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.600
We know that there have been many instances since then, Suez crisis.

13:16.600 --> 13:23.320
They revolt in Hungary, the Tunisian instance, but showed very well that we sometimes have

13:23.320 --> 13:28.280
little consultation if any at all among our color nations.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.200
I think these things should be avoided.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.360
In all of our studies, we shouldn't lose sight of a really big problem.

13:35.360 --> 13:41.440
That is how to keep a group of free and independent nations working together in time of peace.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.000
In time of war, they eventually unite.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.760
In time of peace, however, when the steps are taken, not which wars are made, they tend

13:49.760 --> 13:50.760
to divide.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.640
That is my interest in this whole thing.

13:53.640 --> 13:59.560
I want to be sure that we, all of us, are doing everything that we can now to avoid the

13:59.560 --> 14:00.880
next possible war.

14:00.880 --> 14:06.960
While at the meeting which was held in Bonn, Germany, that's, I first went to, I had a

14:06.960 --> 14:12.800
very interesting personal visit with a statesman for whom I have tremendous respect and admiration.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.240
Chancellor Conrad Eddener of Germany.

14:16.240 --> 14:22.080
I found the Chancellor 82 years old, who was 82 years old and good of health and determined,

14:22.080 --> 14:26.400
eager to go forward with those proposals that I have been discussing.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.520
The Chancellor thinks that now is the time to start talking about the next 10 years of

14:30.520 --> 14:34.560
NATO and to start planning for those years ahead.

14:34.560 --> 14:48.440
He foresees to take the initiative on a broad humanitarian front.

14:48.440 --> 14:52.640
And the way could be paid for that by the citizens' Congress and the Congress that we are

14:52.640 --> 14:54.840
proposing and that I have been telling you about.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.840
Thank you, and that's all until next week.

15:05.560 --> 15:12.360
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, all of us have been concerned about the so-called

15:12.360 --> 15:13.360
recession.

15:13.360 --> 15:18.560
The latest published figures from the Department of Labor show that there are 5,200,000

15:18.560 --> 15:19.560
unemployed.

15:19.560 --> 15:24.960
Reports are that the March figures, when they were available, will show a further increase.

15:24.960 --> 15:29.840
And even these figures do not show the real extent of the cut-in-the-family paycheck.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.400
Over time, it's been largely eliminated everywhere.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.920
And in many instances, work weeks, weeks have been greatly reduced.

15:36.920 --> 15:41.840
Like the other recessions in our history, this one seems to have started on the far and

15:41.840 --> 15:46.240
spread from there to the small towns, the cities, factories, and then to the industrial

15:46.240 --> 15:47.240
areas.

15:47.240 --> 15:52.680
Now, while I do not think it helps matters too much, at all to become hysterical about

15:52.680 --> 15:57.920
the economy, I do think that we ought to do something about it before it gets any worse.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.920
The road program, which the Senate passed this week, will help.

16:00.920 --> 16:05.240
A reduction in prices, which I have been urging, would be a great benefit.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.840
I want to discuss with you another program, which I also think would be a major benefit

16:09.840 --> 16:14.560
to the communities of Tennessee, as well as all other states, and in which I have been

16:14.560 --> 16:16.680
working very hard.

16:16.680 --> 16:21.080
You know there have been many suggestions about accelerating the federal work's program,

16:21.080 --> 16:23.400
the counteracty recession.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.320
The new program that I have been working on in collaboration with Senator Bill Fulbright

16:27.320 --> 16:32.560
of Arkansas, who is chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, would be

16:32.560 --> 16:39.120
designed to accelerate local public works' programs, not by the old PWA of programs, but

16:39.120 --> 16:43.160
through expanding and liberalizing our existing loan programs.

16:43.160 --> 16:47.480
There is an existence a federal program for assistance to public works planning and

16:47.480 --> 16:48.480
financing.

16:48.480 --> 16:53.400
Its purpose is to provide low interest loans to communities for such work.

16:53.400 --> 16:58.400
Higher rate is snarled up in many restrictions, and as such, isn't really filling the need

16:58.400 --> 16:59.400
that it could.

16:59.400 --> 17:05.240
For all practical purposes, it is now limited to communities of less than 5,000 population

17:05.240 --> 17:08.440
for water and sewer disposal systems.

17:08.440 --> 17:15.840
It provides for interest rates of 4.18% on general obligation bonds, 4.58% on revenue

17:15.840 --> 17:18.720
bonds with 30-year materials.

17:18.720 --> 17:23.360
This makes loans attractive only to the communities with a worse credit rate.

17:23.360 --> 17:27.840
Moreover, this program has only $100 million off the recession.

17:27.840 --> 17:32.880
The bill with Senator Fulbright in our proposing would greatly expand this program.

17:32.880 --> 17:37.600
Instead of just water and sewer systems, we would make eligible public streets, sidewalks,

17:37.600 --> 17:43.320
highways, bridges, parking lots, airports, and other transportation facilities.

17:43.320 --> 17:49.760
Also public recreational facilities, public hospitals, rehabilitation and health centers.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.600
Public and refuge in garbage disposal facilities.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.520
Other public utility facilities.

17:56.520 --> 18:02.200
Public police and fire protection work, public schools, libraries, office and other public

18:02.200 --> 18:05.960
buildings, and public conservation facilities.

18:05.960 --> 18:11.440
We would have the interest rate at a maximum of 1.4% above average rates on all government

18:11.440 --> 18:12.440
debt.

18:12.440 --> 18:18.320
This would result in a present rate of 3% the same as college housing loans.

18:18.320 --> 18:24.000
We think 3% rate for this program would tend to bring down interest rates generally throughout

18:24.000 --> 18:25.720
the economy.

18:25.720 --> 18:30.000
We would increase the authorization from 100 million to 2 billion.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.960
Now, I think the advantages of this program are very great.

18:33.960 --> 18:39.160
First, it would be a much faster one than the public works program, and spurring the economy.

18:39.160 --> 18:44.400
The difficulty with a federal program like the road program is that it's slow and getting

18:44.400 --> 18:45.720
started.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.400
The way has to be appropriated.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.000
Plans have to be drawn.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.840
Lands and right away have to be obtained.

18:51.840 --> 18:57.120
However, since these are all local public works, I have an idea that they could be started

18:57.120 --> 18:58.120
much quicker.

18:58.120 --> 19:03.920
In fact, I think it's quite probable, and I talked with many mayors of Tennessee, and I

19:03.920 --> 19:09.840
know this is true, that there's a large backlog of local projects in virtually every community

19:09.840 --> 19:15.480
in the state of Tennessee as a result of post-lomberment caused by war, inflation, and tight

19:15.480 --> 19:16.480
money.

19:16.480 --> 19:21.120
In order to check my opinion on this, I'm writing, I'm in the process of writing letters to the

19:21.120 --> 19:27.600
mayors of all the cities in Tennessee, a 5,000 population or more, and all the county judges

19:27.600 --> 19:30.200
asking their comments on this program.

19:30.200 --> 19:35.160
I'm also asking them for a list of projects, along with the cost of each, on which they could

19:35.160 --> 19:38.360
speedily go forward if our bill is enacted.

19:38.360 --> 19:41.280
Finally, such a program will not run up a huge federal debt.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.280
The money would be repaid.

19:42.280 --> 19:47.120
The project would be entirely under local direction and with local labor.

19:47.120 --> 19:52.200
I'm most hopeful we can get this bill enacted, and we can get this great boost in our

19:52.200 --> 19:54.200
economy to the people of Tennessee.

19:54.200 --> 20:05.800
Thank you, and goodbyes, until next week.

20:05.800 --> 20:10.480
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, Easter is a good time to take a somewhat longer

20:10.480 --> 20:15.360
view than usual, and have a good look at what we have been doing here in Washington and

20:15.360 --> 20:17.120
what we can force these for the future.

20:17.120 --> 20:21.680
I would say that the government, both the President and the Congress, have been principally

20:21.680 --> 20:27.640
concerned with two major problems during these first months of 1958.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.360
One is the continuing quest for peace.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.600
The other is the recession.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.680
Let's talk first about peace.

20:34.680 --> 20:39.240
For without doubt, it is our greatest hope and our most major problem.

20:39.240 --> 20:44.080
It is a radical at the Western nations of the world, those which love democracy, which

20:44.080 --> 20:50.160
respect the individual liberties of the individual man, and which are during this season in their

20:50.160 --> 20:56.200
churches, temples, and center gods, carrying on great peace to religion, have lost to the

20:56.200 --> 20:59.720
anti-religious symbols of peace.

20:59.720 --> 21:04.480
When the eyes of much of the world, the Soviet has gained a great propaganda victory by

21:04.480 --> 21:07.800
his decision to stop thermonuclear tests.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.240
The Soviet Union, not the United States, took the first long step toward holding the

21:12.240 --> 21:16.200
plunge, toward destruction in their view.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.680
Of course we may doubt their sincerity.

21:18.680 --> 21:22.920
We may rightly say that they waited until their latest test series was completed before

21:22.920 --> 21:24.840
taking this step.

21:24.840 --> 21:29.040
But what we say in this regard is contrasted with what they have done.

21:29.040 --> 21:33.920
And even though they may have sacrificed nothing, there is an old saying that actions speak

21:33.920 --> 21:35.560
louder than words.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.600
And in this case, it is they who have acted.

21:38.600 --> 21:43.200
I was among those who have long urged that the United States take the first long step

21:43.200 --> 21:45.200
and cease its test.

21:45.200 --> 21:50.320
It saddens me to see us lose the respect of so much of the world by not having been

21:50.320 --> 21:53.080
the one to take this step first.

21:53.080 --> 21:58.560
If the administration is adamantly determined to go through with the test already scheduled,

21:58.560 --> 22:04.240
then I think at the very least we should announce to the world that following the new schedule,

22:04.240 --> 22:07.880
we too will suspend all future tests.

22:07.880 --> 22:12.400
Meanwhile we should go to the United Nations with a vigorous plea for nuclear and general

22:12.400 --> 22:14.200
disarmament.

22:14.200 --> 22:19.240
Already they are in the stutthouse of both of our nations, enough bombs to destroy most

22:19.240 --> 22:23.000
of life as we know it on the globe today.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.240
A reasonable hope for continuing peace will not come until we begin to dismantle what

22:28.240 --> 22:29.240
we already have.

22:29.240 --> 22:35.080
For as long as it exists, there is danger that it will someday be used.

22:35.080 --> 22:39.840
And there is always the danger that other nations becoming tired of Soviet and United States

22:39.840 --> 22:44.880
domination of the weapon will themselves throw more and more of their productive energies

22:44.880 --> 22:48.720
into the building of thermonuclear arms.

22:48.720 --> 22:54.360
If they do, we may find that we no longer have the power to stop this armaments' rates,

22:54.360 --> 22:55.760
then it will be too late.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.120
And now there is still time.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.840
The British as a matter of fact already have a hydrogen bomb.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.760
France is practically trying to get one and other nations are too.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.040
And unless we stop this race, somebody someday is going to drop one.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.080
And then we may have World War III.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.080
Now for our second subject, the recession.

23:16.080 --> 23:20.480
I think that Congress during these first few months has made a fairly good start at attacking

23:20.480 --> 23:21.960
this problem.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.880
The tight money policy has been somewhat relaxed.

23:24.880 --> 23:29.520
The housing bill, which will mean considerably more building, and therefore more jobs in

23:29.520 --> 23:34.800
Tennessee as well as the rest of the nation, has been enacted and signed into law.

23:34.800 --> 23:39.800
The road bill, which provides for stepped up construction of the interstate highway system,

23:39.800 --> 23:41.200
has been enacted.

23:41.200 --> 23:45.860
This too will mean more jobs in Tennessee, which is an important link in the interstate

23:45.860 --> 23:47.560
highway system.

23:47.560 --> 23:54.440
Our personally was just to point that the community projects bill to assist cities, municipalities,

23:54.440 --> 24:00.080
and counties and school boards in our financial plans, was not enacted before the Easter

24:00.080 --> 24:01.080
Resets.

24:01.080 --> 24:05.560
However, it will be one of the first orders of business after the Resets.

24:05.560 --> 24:11.160
I have received many letters from Tennessee mayors and county judges about this bill.

24:11.160 --> 24:16.040
What they say leads me to believe that if we can keep the interest rates on the loans to

24:16.040 --> 24:20.000
cities and municipalities, the 3% of are below.

24:20.640 --> 24:26.880
Then an act of this bill would mean $65 to $70 million worth of local and greatly needed

24:26.880 --> 24:29.920
public works construction in Tennessee.

24:29.920 --> 24:33.640
These are some of the things that Congress has been doing during the first month of this

24:33.640 --> 24:34.640
session.

24:34.640 --> 24:39.560
I don't say that it has been wholly a satisfactory record, at least it's a good start.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.760
And I hope that the finish will be even more productive of good and useful work.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.560
And I want to wish you a very happy Easter.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.280
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

24:50.000 --> 25:15.520
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I've been reading some old newspapers.

25:15.520 --> 25:19.520
This is the New York Times of Tuesday, April 11, 1933.

25:19.520 --> 25:26.320
It daily reports that the weather was fair with a forecast of showers and cooler on tomorrow.

25:26.320 --> 25:31.160
Bearing light winds returned to New York with a passage by the state legislature of the

25:31.160 --> 25:33.800
bill establishing control boards.

25:33.800 --> 25:38.840
There was a big meeting in Rome attended by Captain Herman Goring, Vice President von

25:38.840 --> 25:41.520
Kepplen and Premier Mussolini.

25:41.520 --> 25:46.760
The subject on discussion was Mussolini's plan for European peace.

25:46.760 --> 25:51.920
Newsher Valais were advertised for as little as $445.

25:51.920 --> 25:56.720
The story that day, however, which proved a most permanent lasting value, was carried

25:56.720 --> 26:00.080
in the left hand column of the New York Times.

26:00.080 --> 26:06.560
Its headlines read Roosevelt Urges Bass Development Under Shoals Plan.

26:06.560 --> 26:11.480
Return to Pioneer Spirit in Tennessee Venture is envisioned in message.

26:11.480 --> 26:17.800
This was the beginning of the TVA, this message of April 10, 1933.

26:17.800 --> 26:22.920
It was the 18th of May before the Tennessee Valley Authority Act was signed into law.

26:22.920 --> 26:28.480
But that was fast in those thrilling first 100 days of the Roosevelt administration.

26:28.480 --> 26:33.720
George Nara's whose picture I have here had been working on it for 12 years.

26:33.720 --> 26:36.720
He was really the father of the TVA.

26:36.720 --> 26:43.920
The power and fertilizer parts had been twice passed by the Congress, but twice vetoed,

26:43.920 --> 26:46.960
once by a coup lege and once by a coup lege.

26:46.960 --> 26:52.720
The new part was Roosevelt's idea of an integrated regional development.

26:52.720 --> 26:57.960
I think that Mr. Roosevelt's original message to Congress would be worth rereading on this

26:57.960 --> 27:01.240
month's 25th anniversary of its writing.

27:01.240 --> 27:05.240
It is brief and I will read most of it to you.

27:06.240 --> 27:13.240
The continued idleness of a great national investment in the Tennessee Valley leaves me to

27:13.240 --> 27:19.240
ask the Congress for legislation necessary to enlist this project in the service of the people.

27:19.240 --> 27:24.040
It is clear that the muscle show development is but a small part of the potential public

27:24.040 --> 27:27.240
usefulness of the entire Tennessee River.

27:27.240 --> 27:33.240
Such use, if envisioned in its entirety transcends mere power development, it enters the wide

27:33.240 --> 27:39.240
field of flood control, soil erosion, reforestation, elimination from agriculture use of marginal

27:39.240 --> 27:44.240
lands and distribution and diversification of industry.

27:44.240 --> 27:51.240
In short, this power development of war days leads logically to national planning for a complete river watershed,

27:51.240 --> 27:55.240
involving many states and the future lives of millions of people.

27:55.240 --> 28:00.240
It touches and gives life to all forms of human concern.

28:00.240 --> 28:05.240
It is a force of suggestion to the Congress legislation to create a Tennessee Valley authority,

28:05.240 --> 28:13.240
a corporation plowed with the power of government, but the zest of the flexibility and initiative of a private enterprise.

28:13.240 --> 28:18.240
This in a true sense is a return to the spirit and vision of the pioneer.

28:18.240 --> 28:24.240
If we are successful here, we can march on step by step and a like development of other great natural

28:24.240 --> 28:29.240
territorial units within our borders, sign Franklin D. Roosevelt.

28:29.240 --> 28:35.240
In these days of false prophets in the nation and in the valley, preaching of doctrine of sale of the TVA

28:35.240 --> 28:39.240
to the municipalities are to the power trust.

28:39.240 --> 28:45.240
In these days of small and petty schemes, detects this great venture of democracy out of existence,

28:45.240 --> 28:49.240
are denied even the right to borrow money.

28:49.240 --> 28:55.240
It is well to look again at the great time and the great spirit in which it was conceived.

28:55.240 --> 29:01.240
Upon the return of Congress and renewed consideration of the self-financing bill,

29:01.240 --> 29:05.240
it is time for a rededication to that same spirit.

29:05.240 --> 29:13.240
After all, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the greatest examples of what a democracy has been able to do in an entire region.

29:13.240 --> 29:21.240
Take a, here is this river completely integrated with dams, with navigation, flood control,

29:21.240 --> 29:24.240
with a new opportunity for people.

29:24.240 --> 29:31.240
It is no wonder when you see what has been done in the Tennessee Valley region that practically all of our foreign visitors,

29:31.240 --> 29:40.240
ministers, members of parliament who come here want to go down and see the TVA in the hope that they can do something similar in their own nation.

29:40.240 --> 29:44.240
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

29:52.240 --> 30:05.240
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, things have been humming here in Washington since the return of Congress after the Easter recess,

30:05.240 --> 30:09.240
and the visits that most members of Congress had with the home port.

30:09.240 --> 30:14.240
I certainly enjoyed my visit during several days down in Tennessee.

30:14.240 --> 30:22.240
The major piece of anti-recessant recession legislation, the Communities Facility Bill, was passed by the U.S. Senate.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.240
This is the bill concerning which I have spoken with you before.

30:25.240 --> 30:37.240
It is the bill which I co-sponsored with Senator Fulbright of Arkansas, and which has had a very enthusiastic reception from city and county officials and from school and other officials in Tennessee.

30:37.240 --> 30:41.240
The number of letters I have gotten about this bill is really amazing.

30:41.240 --> 30:51.240
It is the way by which I think we can get the quickest results in launching anti-recession work, because its purpose is to make it possible for local public works,

30:51.240 --> 30:57.240
long delayed by the war, tight money and rising city and county budgets to get underway now.

30:57.240 --> 31:09.240
I found that many of these programs have already been planned and drawn up to details so that they are ready to go immediately when they can get money and a reasonable rate of interest.

31:09.240 --> 31:13.240
It does so without the necessity of establishing a new federal agency.

31:13.240 --> 31:25.240
The bill merely increases the present public facility loan program of the housing and home finance agency to $1 billion and expands the type of things that it can cover.

31:25.240 --> 31:36.240
Under this bill they will include housing, school buildings, hospitals, water and sewer systems, sidewalks, and almost all other types of needed public improvements.

31:36.240 --> 31:50.240
Furthermore, it makes it easier to pay by reducing the interest from the current rates of 4.5% to 3.5% and raising the person's 40-year maximum terms of these loans to 50 years.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.240
I am not yet satisfied with the interest rate.

31:53.240 --> 31:59.240
I thank for this program to work best that it ought to be 3% or lower.

31:59.240 --> 32:05.240
I am still hopeful that this lower interest rate might be achieved when the bill is considered in the House of Representatives.

32:05.240 --> 32:10.240
We tried to reduce it that far in the Senate but we lost by one vote.

32:10.240 --> 32:16.240
Let me say that that 3% of federal government wouldn't lose anything on this program whatsoever.

32:16.240 --> 32:32.240
On my recent trip to Tennessee and as a result of a flood of letters that I have received, I found that there was a tremendous backlog of public works of a local nature which can be expected to be undertaken at once when this bill finally becomes law.

32:32.240 --> 32:39.240
Another peg in the Annie Recession Goldworks we are building became law with a President's signature of the highway bill.

32:39.240 --> 32:43.240
Tennessee is an important part of the interstate road system.

32:43.240 --> 32:51.240
Stretching from Bristol to Memphis and linking all of the major cities, this bill would be a great boom to the state of Tennessee.

32:51.240 --> 33:00.240
Unfortunately, the President vetoed the Rivers and Farber's bill in which there were many projects which would be beneficial to the volunteer state.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.240
I doubt if his veto could be overwritten.

33:04.240 --> 33:13.240
In a separate field but one which is also caused a great deal of concern, the President of the Congress has billed on military reorganization.

33:13.240 --> 33:22.240
It will be firstly contested by some who think that it contemplates too much power in the chief of staff and in the secretary of defense.

33:23.240 --> 33:27.240
I am not prepared to approve the test of this bill in all of its tales.

33:27.240 --> 33:36.240
Military organization is a complicated matter and his bill will receive considerable study before the armed services committee of which I am a member.

33:36.240 --> 33:43.240
But I am prepared to say that I agree with his general philosophy as expressed in his message and in the bill.

33:44.240 --> 33:54.240
I think that there has to be some one or group in charge with overall command authority in a fast moving military set up such as we have today.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.240
And that if we had that we would save a whole lot of money.

33:57.240 --> 34:08.240
Furthermore, I think that the best place to centralize that authority is in the civilian's head, the secretary of defense and through him to the chief of staff and down to the combat forces.

34:09.240 --> 34:13.240
I also approve of the reduction in the number of the system secretaries.

34:13.240 --> 34:19.240
There has been entirely too much bureaucracy and passing the book too many committees in the Pentagon.

34:19.240 --> 34:29.240
I dare say that his bill of the president will not be approved will in milling but with a great deal of soul searching and as full and complete hearings.

34:29.240 --> 34:37.240
The American people have never liked militaryism but they are prepared to accept command responsibility and that philosophy, our predict will be approved.

34:37.240 --> 34:40.240
Thank you and goodbye until next week.
