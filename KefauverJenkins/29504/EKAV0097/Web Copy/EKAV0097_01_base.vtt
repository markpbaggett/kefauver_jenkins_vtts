WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, from time to time on this program, we have

00:06.000 --> 00:11.520
talked about the Trade Expansion Act, which President Kennedy has recommended and about

00:11.520 --> 00:14.360
which we are also interested.

00:14.360 --> 00:20.240
This I think is the biggest matter that will come before this Congress by far.

00:20.240 --> 00:25.320
Bill has passed the House of Representatives, giving the President extended authority and

00:25.320 --> 00:32.000
connection with our Trade Agreement Program and it will soon be coming up in the Senate.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.680
So I thought that we would use this program today to talk about it.

00:36.680 --> 00:42.000
And to give us some facts and information about the program, we are very fortunate today

00:42.000 --> 00:49.480
in having with us Mr. Howard C. Peterson, the Assistant to the President on Trade Policies.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.920
There's certainly glad to have you with us, Mr. Peterson.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.520
It's a real pleasure, Senator.

00:54.520 --> 01:00.880
And I'm Mr. Peterson has been appearing before committees, giving information, telling what

01:00.880 --> 01:07.240
our present situation is, what the new expansion will mean and why it's so necessary.

01:07.240 --> 01:11.440
But Mr. Peterson, I believe that you are a very distinct, while you're a big banker,

01:11.440 --> 01:16.520
big in several ways, I'm sure physically and otherwise from Philadelphia, aren't you?

01:16.520 --> 01:17.520
I am.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.360
I have good many friends in the banking fraternity, I'm going to say too.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
Yes, I know you do.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.360
I was flimming.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
Oh, I know.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.360
I was saying, I know the American bankers are so sweet.

01:26.360 --> 01:30.920
We're all very proud of Sam Fleming from over at Nashville and he is the President of the

01:30.920 --> 01:32.360
American Bank of our association.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.960
Of course, I know a lot of bankers, but I'm not always very happy to see them.

01:35.960 --> 01:36.960
Oh, no.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.160
Peterson, no, no.

01:38.160 --> 01:43.360
You know, sometimes they ask me to come down and pay notes and the links of that sort.

01:43.360 --> 01:48.040
But friends, of course, in Tennessee, we have always been internationally minded.

01:48.040 --> 01:55.400
We understand the importance of exporting goods to other nations.

01:55.400 --> 02:02.320
And of course, we've had a great statesman of Tennessee who was Mr. Cordell Holt, founder

02:02.320 --> 02:04.120
of the Trade Agreement Act.

02:04.120 --> 02:10.560
The inception of really the whole liberal trade policy in the United States started

02:10.560 --> 02:13.920
with Mr. Cordell Holt in 1934.

02:14.920 --> 02:22.320
And Trade Expansion Act, which is now before the Senate, is a natural continuation of

02:22.320 --> 02:28.280
these policies which were approved some 11 times by the Congress of the United States

02:28.280 --> 02:29.280
in extending the act.

02:29.280 --> 02:38.120
Well, Mr. Holt and his great statesman ship showed that how trade was necessary for employment,

02:38.120 --> 02:43.680
for industrial expansion for the farmers of America.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.520
And also a very important part, which I have been interested in as a person who attends

02:48.520 --> 02:55.080
the NATO Parliamentary Meet Parliamentary meetings and other things is that Mr. Holt preached

02:55.080 --> 02:59.200
and showed that if you trade with the people of the world, you have a better chance of

02:59.200 --> 03:01.760
living in peace with them.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.360
So that we are interested in Tennessee.

03:04.360 --> 03:09.400
And I think at this time, we might also hear from the President of the United States and

03:09.400 --> 03:11.640
his State of the Union message.

03:11.640 --> 03:16.640
He very briefly put forth the challenge in connection with the Trade Agreement's Expansion

03:16.640 --> 03:17.640
Act.

03:17.640 --> 03:23.120
And so we'll hear from the President of the United States.

03:23.120 --> 03:36.520
Now, Mr. Peterson, this new bill that we are considering gives the President an extended

03:36.520 --> 03:40.960
power in connection with tariffs and trade agreements.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.800
What is the necessity for it?

03:42.800 --> 03:47.520
What has taken place in the world that makes this situation necessary?

03:47.520 --> 03:55.320
There is a new trading world and the best demonstration of this is the great and phenomenal

03:55.320 --> 03:59.320
growth of the common market in Europe.

03:59.320 --> 04:06.520
This was only started in 1958, which was the last time that the Trade Agreement's program

04:06.520 --> 04:08.000
came before the Congress.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.920
In the common market, you know, you have the Battleix countries, Belgium and Holland and

04:15.920 --> 04:21.040
Luxembourg and you have France and Germany and Italy.

04:21.040 --> 04:24.840
And they are going to abolish the tariffs between Britain.

04:24.840 --> 04:29.400
Britain has now asked to join and its succession to this market.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.040
I think seems reasonably assured.

04:32.040 --> 04:41.040
And they are really doing, they are creating a market just as we create a market in 1789 with

04:41.040 --> 04:47.560
no tariffs between the states and with a common external tariff against the outsiders.

04:47.560 --> 04:52.600
This is the most important market, which our exporters enjoy.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.600
I mean, 19...

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
Yes, how much did we accept?

04:54.600 --> 04:58.080
It was under like $6 billion last year.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.240
And then we united Kingdom and the Western Europe.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.960
And from this market, something only taking about four billions.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.960
So we have a very favorable balance of trade.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.960
Very balanced on the plus side of about two billion dollars.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.960
Right.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.400
And it's our most important market for farm produce.

05:15.400 --> 05:22.200
I mean, they take a great deal of our wheat, our tobacco, our cotton, many, many of our

05:22.200 --> 05:23.200
products of our farm.

05:23.200 --> 05:29.040
But even in manufacturers, we have a balance, a favorable balance of trade with them.

05:29.040 --> 05:34.520
Now, one thing we know is that they are going to abolish all the tariffs between the

05:34.520 --> 05:38.640
member states and erect this common external tariff.

05:38.640 --> 05:45.440
And then, unless we can kind of batter down this common external tariff so that the discrimination

05:45.440 --> 05:50.560
against this is at least tolerable and we can still get in and sell our goods, we are

05:50.560 --> 05:54.760
going to lose our position in this important market.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.520
This is kind of the threat side, but there's also a challenge side.

05:58.520 --> 06:02.120
Well, let's talk a little bit more about just what it means.

06:02.120 --> 06:09.120
When the world, generally, last year, we exported something in the neighborhood of 20 billion

06:09.120 --> 06:19.760
dollars and we imported about 15, so that we sold about five billion more than we took

06:19.760 --> 06:20.760
in.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.080
Now, what does this mean to the American people and to the manufacturers and to the farmers,

06:25.080 --> 06:27.080
Mr. Peterson, the fact that we...

06:27.080 --> 06:32.960
Well, it means jobs, it means profits.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.960
When you analyze these figures, there isn't a really...

06:35.960 --> 06:41.560
The story isn't told by the difference between the 20 billion and the 15 because of this

06:41.560 --> 06:44.040
15 billion of imports.

06:44.040 --> 06:50.200
About 60 percent are things we either don't produce at all or we produce it in sufficient

06:50.200 --> 06:51.200
quantities.

06:51.200 --> 06:57.560
We have 10 and a nickel and a whole range of industrial goods which create jobs because

06:57.560 --> 06:59.920
without them our factors could run.

06:59.920 --> 07:06.340
All the things like tropical agriculture products, which we like like bananas, and coffee

07:06.340 --> 07:13.400
and cocoa and tea, so that you only really, in terms of job competing, have imports of

07:13.400 --> 07:17.720
about $6 billion and you have to compare this with the 20 billion dollars.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.120
There have been lots of the estimates made of what the jobs involved are.

07:21.120 --> 07:25.900
I think the labor of the farm and the labor of the statistics says it was about 3 million

07:25.900 --> 07:28.920
jobs in factories directly related to export.

07:28.920 --> 07:35.680
Industrial plants and about a great many on the farms of the United States where we export

07:35.680 --> 07:37.680
a great deal of our farm product.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.680
Right, that's true.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.680
Right.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.560
Well, I think we've got a ton of people to see what I'd like to know just briefly, but

07:43.560 --> 07:48.140
the present export program means to the people of Tennessee.

07:48.140 --> 07:55.960
According to the record, almost 78 million jobs in Tennessee in 1900 and 78 thousand.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.960
78 thousand, oh yeah.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.960
I know that Tennessee is a lot of the important ones.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
But I think they're quite that many.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.560
Not quite that many.

08:04.560 --> 08:13.240
But anyway, almost 77 thousand employees worked in factories that exported more than

08:13.240 --> 08:14.240
$220 million.

08:14.240 --> 08:21.240
And also that we are 16th in that year in manufacturing exports.

08:21.240 --> 08:30.240
And we find that in agriculture in Tennessee in 1961 that we exported products amounting

08:30.240 --> 08:33.240
to $93 million.

08:33.240 --> 08:43.840
A million in livestock and animals, 600 thousand in fruit and nuts, 600 thousand in vegetables,

08:43.840 --> 08:50.840
that we had 37,600 farm workers were employed in producing things that were exported.

08:50.840 --> 08:56.160
You know, you have a substantial stake in Tennessee on this program.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.880
We are of course worried about the fact that we've had a gold ray in against the United

09:00.880 --> 09:04.320
States for off and on for some years.

09:04.320 --> 09:09.080
Unless we can export and have a favorable trade balance, that gold ray will continue to

09:09.080 --> 09:10.080
be larger.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.080
We'll get larger and larger.

09:11.080 --> 09:18.760
If we could actually increase our export surplus, this is one possible way of avoiding

09:18.760 --> 09:22.480
any drain on our gold and well-alancing on our repayments.

09:22.480 --> 09:28.640
Our export surplus has met a whole lot to employment and industries on the farm, starting

09:28.640 --> 09:31.640
in a leap of this country in the past.

09:31.640 --> 09:36.680
What is your prediction if we can negotiate somehow with this great common market that

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
has become a reality?

09:37.680 --> 09:43.480
Do you think it will mean even more additional employment for the people in the United States?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.280
Well, I believe so, Sun Gerrit.

09:45.280 --> 09:51.680
I think it's very hard to prove anything about the future because it's the future is rather

09:51.680 --> 09:52.680
inscrutable.

09:52.680 --> 09:58.640
It much depends on the general level of the economic activity of the trading partners.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.120
But we know that we're going to be worse in our position if we're not able to deal with

10:03.120 --> 10:04.720
the common market.

10:04.720 --> 10:10.720
And I think we have the opportunity of enhancing our export position in this market because

10:10.720 --> 10:15.720
it has a big demand factor that is growing so rapidly and it is our most important.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.640
Now, of course, our industries are going to be adversely affected.

10:18.640 --> 10:26.000
We know that, of course, and some they perhaps can manufacture things in other countries

10:26.000 --> 10:28.200
more reasonably than we can.

10:28.200 --> 10:33.600
Are there provisions in the bill for taking care of these adversely affected?

10:33.600 --> 10:40.680
I think the President's proposals in the Trade Expansion Act make better provision

10:40.680 --> 10:46.520
for these possibilities and have ever been suggested to the Congress before because there's

10:46.520 --> 10:54.280
a program of trade adjustment assistance whereby small firms, if they're hurt by import

10:54.280 --> 11:01.000
competition, can obtain governmental assistance in the forms of loans and workers, if they're

11:01.000 --> 11:06.560
unemployed or if they find they're under employed because of import competition, can obtain

11:06.560 --> 11:13.520
allowances which will permit them to be retrained for jobs in which they can better compete.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.760
But I don't think that really we're going to feel these hurts.

11:16.760 --> 11:21.280
In the first place, this program will go into effect only very gradually.

11:21.280 --> 11:27.240
The act of odds of any reductions in tariffs may not be put into effect in a period of less

11:27.240 --> 11:28.240
than five years.

11:28.240 --> 11:32.320
Now, this gives a lot of time for a just a normal adjustment.

11:32.320 --> 11:37.200
And of course, the big thing that appeals to me and I think all Americans is that by having

11:37.200 --> 11:44.240
a great trading area that we are gaining in strength as against the Soviet bloc.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.840
And I think it might be well who hear the President again as to what this kind of leadership

11:48.840 --> 11:50.840
means.

11:50.840 --> 12:03.680
Well, I know that Mr. Krushchev doesn't want to see this common market become a reality

12:03.680 --> 12:07.160
and he doesn't want to be the one to become a part of it because that's the reason.

12:07.160 --> 12:13.480
That means that economically and industrially and in all kinds of strength we'll have a much

12:13.480 --> 12:18.360
great advantage over the communist bloc and therefore a better chance for peace in the

12:18.360 --> 12:19.360
world, doesn't it?

12:19.360 --> 12:21.000
I strongly believe that, sir.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.120
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Peterson, for being with us and that's all for this time,

12:27.120 --> 12:27.480
friends.
