00:00.000 --> 00:12.080
As I recall it was a matter of going out in the anti-room, the next room to the office

00:12.080 --> 00:16.000
and coming back in and possibly going out and coming back in once or twice.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Well you'll be going just a minute or two or a minute or two.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
I would say just a minute or two.

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
Well now when you say you weren't there at the beginning, you must have come in when Mr. Adams and Mr. Cohn were there alone.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
No, as I recall I believe I was there during the when Mr. Adams arrived.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
But during that first portion I was in and out of the room for once twice.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Well then you don't want the state that you weren't there at the beginning of it.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Well I don't think that there would be a mistake.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I just want to know what it is.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
It's as I testified.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
It wasn't fair throughout the entire early part of the conversation I was in and out.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
I'd like to read you sir your testimony from the page 6558.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Mr. Cohn?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
I'll read it. I think you won't disagree with my reading.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Mr. Proto asked you the following question.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
Were you within hearing distance of Mr. Cohn and Mr. Adams during the entire time of their conversation on this particular day?

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
And you answered yes I was except for the very beginning of the conversation on the 14th.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Now if you could have been mistaken or you could have been confused about it.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
But were you there for the beginning of it and then left from time to time?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Or were you just not there when it started?

02:02.000 --> 02:13.000
So it's my recollection that I was there when Mr. Adams arrived at a smile recollection that during the beginning of the conversation, the early part of the conversation,

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
for some reason or other, I was called out of the room and I was in another room maybe once or twice.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
You were out answering and making telephone calls.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
That's that question.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I don't really know why I was out there. Could be that I was there.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Do you have any recollection?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
No, it could be that I was making this.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
So I was just going to say.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
It could be that you were there for more than just a moment or two.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
It could be but my recollection is that I was there for just a moment or two running in and out for some reason.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
What is it I don't know?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Well in any event you were not there all the time.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
That's correct.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Well, you weren't not there particularly at the front end of the conversation.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
That's correct.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Now let's turn to your telephone conversation, Mr. Car.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm not sure that I'm going to, that I'm right in saying this,

03:11.000 --> 03:23.000
but I got the impression that yesterday you thought or you testified that Mr. Adams sought you up in the latter part of February and the early part of March.

03:23.000 --> 03:34.000
What did you, was that concerning the business of the first part of February?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
No, the first part of March.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
I could be wrong about it, but you recall whether you sought Mr. Adams out or he sought you out?

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Well, I don't, I don't really know.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I think it might have been one of the other.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
Now I recall that he, that's talking about the fifth of March,

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
I recall that he had specific things that he wanted me to do.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I don't know whether that's seeking me out of it.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Did you have specific things you wanted him to do?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
No, not at that time, for now.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Well, let's look at your phone call for the second day of March.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
All right, sir.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Do you have it there?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
545 in the afternoon?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes, sir.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
And I think it's about the second, from the bottom, the little large paragraph that says Mr. Car.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
I guess that is about it, except that I would very much like to get together with you on this,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
so we could have a private chat sometime while we have a quiet moment.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yes.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Now what was this that you were talking about?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Well, I think that we first told the conversation we were talking about here.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
And what was that, sir?

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
This is the matter that might take a moment here.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Certainly.

04:58.000 --> 05:07.000
Oh, yes.

05:07.000 --> 05:18.000
This refers to the fact that during this period, as I recall, we had before the subcommittee,

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
people like Major Perez, other uniformed, homie personnel, I think that's what it refers to.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
And during this period, I think that Secretary Stevens was to appear before the committee,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
and his appearance was put off.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
Was this the time that he testified yesterday that Mr. Adams talked to you about whether or not Mr. Cohn was mad at him,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and what you can do to catch it up?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Well, this, no.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
The time that I spoke to him about that was Mr. Cohn and Senator McCarthy.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
That conversation is on the fifth of March.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
On the fifth of March?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yes.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Well, as of the second of March, you, as Mr. Adams, to come to see you through, you can have a private chat.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
That's correct.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
Well, I said to Mr. Adams, I wish that we were all as much like to get together on this,

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
so we could have a chat, right?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
That's correct.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
That's correct.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
No, I don't mean do we elaborate unnecessarily on these.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
And the words of Mr. Cohn and Senator McCarthy are directly used.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Mr. Cohn, you have any questions?

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Chair, may I ask anything from my left?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Am I right?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
As far as Senator McCarthy?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Back to you, Mr. Cohn, for every ten minutes.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Now on the fourth of March.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Mr. Cohn, you have that?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Of course.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Yes, mine, 25.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
Yes, and on the last page, you find where you said, I want to come over on other things.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
I want you to come over on other things.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
It's near the bottom, I think it's...

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Just a moment.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Does night stuff exist in the bottom?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I'll come up on the list.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes, I find it.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I find it.

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
And here again, you were asking Mr. Adams to come over to see you, isn't that right?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Yes, it can be turned up.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Well, it says I want you to come over on other things.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
That's right.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Mr. I, isn't it?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yes, I do.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I do.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I do.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I do.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
That's right.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
That's right, isn't it?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
That's right.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
And then someone to get to that very good eating place, the method is correct.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Ah.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Yes, yes, that's right.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Now I'm turning to the fifth of March.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Right, just a moment.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Have you found it there?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Right.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
You have to know you were that fortunate with the deals with Cadillacs and Chevrolet's and things, don't you?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
We call what the...

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
That portion of this call the deals with Cadillacs and second-hand Chevrolet's.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Ah, how do we call it?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Now let me check.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yes, right.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
It's quite a long call, I just tried to worry about it.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
And almost immediately following that.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
There is some discussion about a leadership school, isn't that correct?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Is that the following out of the house?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Let me show you.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Well, let me read Mr. Adam.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yes, yes, you're right.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
I don't want you to tell Roy, because I don't want him to think he has a commitment to leadership.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
You find that?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I'm sure it's your own fund, Mr.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
We'll take your time. We're in our place.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Speak only for yourself.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
One of the place, three.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Right, you find that?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Right.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
You know of any reason why Mr. Adam Blinwantth Roy told about the leadership course?

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Yes, well what reason would he not want Roy to know?

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, I think Mr. Adams had a mind that this was something that...

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Had not been straightened out, something had not been settled.

09:43.000 --> 09:52.000
It seems to me that sometime earlier Mr. Adams had told Mr. Cohn that Mr. Shine would be in training.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Some school down at Georgia Camp Gordon, I believe.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
I think Mr. Cohn would be in training.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
Some school down at Georgia Camp Gordon, I believe.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
For a period of first he told him five weeks and then it was eight weeks and then it was ten weeks.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
And Mr. Adams was somewhat embarrassed when it turned out to be something like several months.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
That happened I think sometime in January.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I like that way.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Why he doesn't want to tell Mr. Cohn something and then later have to tell him something else.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Well if you know what difference did it make supporting it turn out in five years.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Was there any business of Mr. Cohn?

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
Well I think you have to remember that this is the date of this call.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
This call is March 5th.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
That's correct.

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
March 5th between March 5th and sometime I think it was the 18th of February.

10:53.000 --> 11:12.000
Many things have happened which made it, would lead some people to believe that possibly Mr. Shine might not be going to this school or whatever he was going to join in.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
But still it isn't for Mr. Cohn to tell the Army what to do with Shine?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Of course not.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
No but the Army is...

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Well they want to call Mr. Cohn what was going on.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
That's correct.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Mr. Adams had told Mr. Cohn about it.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
That's where it is.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
You think Mr. Adams volunteers that or did Mr. Cohn ask for that into making?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I don't know.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
Do I refresh a recollection as to the subject of your telephone call to sound to Cohn now?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
No you don't.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
That had to do with it not with how long it was going to be a camp Gordon's.

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
My testimony and my recollection both are to the effect that...

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
No if I haven't written that by recollection I haven't done so.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
That's correct.

11:55.000 --> 12:03.000
Now you said he will be pestering me to know if anyone will change other things.

12:03.000 --> 12:03.000


12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Have Mr. Cohn been pestering you about private Shine?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
No sir.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Well you predicted that he would be didn't he?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Yes this is a huge attempt.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I said you predicted.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yes sir.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
If anyone will change other things that means other things about private Shine doesn't it?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Yes sir.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
What other things were you referring to Mr. Cohn?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I think that...

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
I think now this is a conversation which I didn't know was being recorded in spite of some of the language in this conversation.

12:39.000 --> 12:48.000
It's some time ago my recollection of it is that when I said he will be pestering me to know if anyone will change other things.

12:48.000 --> 12:57.000
My recollection is that the other things were the schooling that Mr. Shine was scheduled as old as that.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And that's your recollection.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Would that have been a new artist, St. Louis, Mr. Cohn?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
With no cards?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
No sir.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
As I recall this was a...

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Ah you said no.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
No.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And this to Adam says what other things?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What expects to do?

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
And then you said I would like to report looks about the same as before.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Same as before.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
This part I want.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Now what was it that you wanted to report as being the same as before?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh the...

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
As I say now this is a somewhat gobbled conversation here.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I know but we'll have a little struggle with it.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
That's right.

13:38.000 --> 13:59.000
Well struggling along with it I would say that I would be further here to the fact that I would like to say that Mr. Cohn or that the army was not going to make any change in Mr. Shine's assignment which he had earned while at Fort Dix.

13:59.000 --> 14:10.000
Because of the fact that some of the news papers have made much of a disagreement between Senator Mccasci and the structure of the army.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
How did you know he'd earned anything Mr. Cohn?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I understood you didn't care much what happened to him in the military.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I didn't care much what happened to him in the military.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Then how do you know whether he earned or didn't earn anything?

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
Mr. Adams or Mr. Cohn and I believe Mr. Adams told me that Mr. Cohn was not going to be able to do anything.

14:28.000 --> 14:39.000
Mr. Cohn had been thrown into some sort of a category and Mr. Cohn has something I don't know too much about.

14:39.000 --> 14:49.000
In the army when you go through basic training you were graded and collected by categories and if you fall in certain categories you become infantry men.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
If you fall in another category you become an investigator and another category and so on.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Well are you trying to suggest that perhaps the army discriminated against this private?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
No sir.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
As far as I know there was no discrimination.

15:08.000 --> 15:14.000
There was a talk in the paper about if not going to a school but I don't know if there was discrimination.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
And that's what you think that you were talking about when you said that you wanted to report that there had been no change?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Uh, yes sir.

15:25.000 --> 15:35.000
Did you think there was a strange for you the director of the subcommittee staff to be still talking about Cheyenne after all of these months?

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
Well no I think if you go back in this conversation you'll see that Mr. Adams first brought up the name of Cheyenne.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
No but you didn't tell him no don't bother me with Cheyenne you didn't say that or like that.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
No at this point with a formal subject of conversation between the both of you wasn't it?

15:52.000 --> 16:05.000
No at this point of the game there was this as I said it's somewhat overplayed controversy between the senator and the secretary.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
The press had made a big thing of it.

16:08.000 --> 16:20.000
At this point I was interested to see that Mr. Cheyenne was not discriminated against because of something that was going on in the committee.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
You were fearful also that this private would be discriminated against?

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
No I was not fearful of that if you discriminated against.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
But I think I would be less than thankful to say that I invited to be frank sir you're invited today.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
But I didn't have an interest in it this point.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
When did your interest develop Mr. Carr?

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
I don't know how exactly how to answer that question.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
I'll do the Master's Candle.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
It seems to me that this was the period and this is just my recollection.

16:55.000 --> 17:05.000
This was the period following the much built up controversy between the secretary and the senator.

17:05.000 --> 17:23.000
The conversations I had with Mr. Cohn and the senator at some time mentioned was made in the fact that they might possibly cancel out days of school or they were going to because of this controversy.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Did you have a very time to describe it?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Well they are going around but we're trying to watch too.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Mr. Cohn is on the move.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
They continue another ten minutes.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Mr. Cohn, glad that you are.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
I'm almost true.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Then you said this statement.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
This would indicate that he would get whatever he is supposed to get.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
That's in the form of a question.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
What did you think he was supposed to get Mr. Carr?

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Well, let me tell you this first.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
I don't know whether it was in the form of a question when I originally said it.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Well, it says so here.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I'll go along with that.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
This would indicate that he would get whatever he is supposed to get.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
What was it that you thought he was supposed to get?

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
I thought he was supposed to get anything in the army that he had earned in the dirt.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
He was supposed to get everything in the army.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
So he always indicated to me that he would get in the army.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, you've never learned anything else about it.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Did Mr. Cohn have a different view from you on that subject?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I don't think he did.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Did Mr. Cohn think he had to get more than he got?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I don't think he did.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Have you thought that he got more than he got?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
No, sir.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
You're satisfied with his status at the moment, aren't you?

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I think I said earlier.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
I thought that he was qualified for a commission.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
The fact that they didn't give him a commission is evidence.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
When did you think he was qualified for a commission?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
All along, I still think he is.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
You hadn't even met him until the middle of August, did you?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
No, but what I've been told about him.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Well, I see. Someone told you something about him and then you thought he had a commission.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
That's right.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
That's the only basis for your status.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, no.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
The SM, no, my knowledge of him, comments mainly from one of the people that told me.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
I did have some association with him during the fall before he left for the army.

19:35.000 --> 19:43.000
Well, now passing on a little bit further down, you find a place where it says Mr. Carr.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
I'll tell Mr. Roy.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
That's the moment.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
I skipped quite a few because I want to get through it.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Yes, I find it.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Yes, I find it.

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
Why is it that you didn't want Roy to know about this leadership course?

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Well, I don't think I didn't want Mr. Roy to know about it.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
I think Mr. Adams didn't want him to know about it.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
No, but you're the one that says, but don't you tell Mr. Roy?

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
Well, that's what this monitored phone call seems to imply.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Sure, it doesn't only imply it.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
It says it, doesn't it?

20:21.000 --> 20:29.000
Well, it says it, but on the other hand, this is what somebody typed up who says they took down something and they missed other things.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
So you're saying this is wrong, is there, right?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I'm not saying this is wrong.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I'm saying that I don't recall saying it this way.

20:36.000 --> 20:44.000
My recollection of this phone call is that it's pretty much as it appears here, except that I would think looking back at it,

20:44.000 --> 20:51.000
and that's all I can do at this point, I would think looking back at it, that Mr. Adams probably said that for this reason.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
He says, down here, start the sentence of reason.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
I don't, I don't, I won't tell him this is he would start calling me, etc., etc.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
I don't, well he agreed with you didn't he that you shouldn't tell Roy?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
You and he were an agreement on that.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, that's what it looks like in here.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
You both had the same experience with Roy when the problem of private trying came up, hadn't you?

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
No, I, I couldn't have any vent.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
In any vent, you know what his experience was, so you heard his testimony.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I heard his testimony, right.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
You said, but don't you tell Mr. Roy, then Mr. Adams said, I won't.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Then you said, I want a commitment on that, do you see that?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
I see.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
You made it very far, but you didn't want Roy to know about this leadership too.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
Well, as I say here, I can read this thing several ways and I'm sure that you can read it a few more.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
The way I, I find it hard to read it any other way, but if you didn't want Roy to know.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
All right.

21:50.000 --> 22:00.000
If I, if I go along with you on that, I think I'd have to go back and say, I, I'm trying to be agreeable with Mr. Sincere.

22:00.000 --> 22:09.000
If I go back and say, I go on with you on that, then I'd have to go back and say, say that perhaps it refers back to this statement, Mr. Adams says,

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
four weeks does not make, uh, make a man a general.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
You, that isn't what you didn't want Roy to know, did it?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Well, I don't know, that's what it says here.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
Oh, now Mr. Carr, you don't want us to understand that you wanted a commitment.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Mr. Adams wouldn't tell Roy that four weeks didn't make a general.

22:29.000 --> 22:37.000
No, but, but, but the way it was, we're saying now we're sitting here at this point trying to figure out what something meant several months ago.

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
At a time when I, I, uh, didn't know something was being monitored, we already had testimony that several.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
There was a lot of people, but there it is.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
And that's still on it.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to, I'm trying to make it out here.

22:52.000 --> 22:59.000
Uh, another thing I think about this, that if it refers back to this, don't make, uh, four weeks don't make,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
uh, those aren't made to make a manager.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
I think it, uh, may, uh, be a facetious remark on my part or that of Mr. Adams.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
But you weren't being facetious when you said I want a commitment on that work.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Uh, I could very well offend. You could have been.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Yes, sir.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
You want to leave it now that what you didn't want Roy to know, was that four weeks did not make a general.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
No, I want to leave it just the way it is here. I think you should leave it to Roy.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I want to leave it to Roy. It is here, then.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Roy. Right. Right. Right.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
How much time is it here, Roy?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
That's right.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
I, I think that I would like more than like that.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
The burden of my opinion is here.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I want to talk to you.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Yes, you go ahead.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Yes, sir.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
You go ahead.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Fast and set up.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
I think we've heard different numbers here.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Not that I asked the significant two of this.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
The number of men you have on that staff.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
Yes. Well, you now tell us definitely how many men there are on that staff.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Yes, sir.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Okay.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
Right. It's my recollection after, uh, that there are 14, but I would not like to give you a straight down.

24:34.000 --> 24:42.000
I believe that's right. I think we've heard the figure 10 and 14, but since I am sure we have heard 14, if you think now that's correct.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
I will be willing to assume it is.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
I'm not going to even get this, but you'd be correct.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But is that probably right?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I think that's correct.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
And although it's 14, how many are lawyers?

24:55.000 --> 25:00.000
I believe it's five or four lawyers, five lawyers.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Yes.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Yes, sir.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
Five or investigators, five investigators.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
One research director.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
One research director.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
One accountant.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
One accountant.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Right.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Yes.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
The executive director.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
That's you.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Yes, sir.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And the chief counsel.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
That's it?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
That's six lawyers and all you mean this?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Yes.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Yes, sir.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
One, two, three.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Counsel.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Now we're up to 10.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Well, at least, that would be, at least, six and something.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
That's right, I'm wrong.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
That's the whole 14.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Now I have to win them now, maybe.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
Uh, women, uh, uh, can I believe the, uh,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
an hour's 80 by the FFFFFF壓on.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Well, as a chief court, one chief court, a staff editor.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
A staff editor?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Right.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Have to know what on me, what was that?

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Well, that's the young lady that says, uh, getting out the, uh,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
printed here, you know?

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Uh, then, uh, seven assistant clerks,

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
seven assistant clerks, and uh, seven assistant clerks?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Yes.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
So what do they do?

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Well, seven assistant clerks, uh, are, uh,

26:17.000 --> 26:23.000
secretary and assistant clerks coverage, uh, many jobs.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Well, secretary.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
They're all, but I don't, do those seven have secretary of fainting?

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
Uh, yes, I think.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I'm doing secretary of work, yeah.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
At least most of them.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Is one of them, especially, is found you in the secretary?

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
Uh, Mrs. Men's, uh, uh, secretary of the board, Mr. Connell,

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
well, I take it that the, uh,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
a lot of his secretary of work is done, even the senator's office,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
or in New York, is that right?

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
Uh, well, I, I suppose that he does do some in New York, uh,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
although I, I don't know too much about that.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I haven't seen much of that.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
He does do some, uh, with, uh,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
intractor senator McCoff, who's office yesterday.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Uh, uh, uh,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
If you were to work yesterday, how much your assistant's

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
name's time is consumed by you and how much by Mr. Cole?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
What would you say?

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
Well, uh, I would have to, uh,

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
add a third entity to that and say that Mrs. Men's also does work for, uh,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
the rest of the staff when she's not doing something for us.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Uh, that's better.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
We have three and I would say that it will be divided into, uh,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I would say perhaps equal parts.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Turn any fire in the next fifteen minutes ahead, David?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Second portion.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Let's go out.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
How long are you going to do this in place?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Is this in place?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Yes, the city of Chalde-Claude.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Uh, uh, let's go out.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
This is a thing called,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
I think, so I would have to call Mr. St. Fred,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
St. Fred, and stuff.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
I think the chair made that for the sake of the day.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
It made a good presentation of that.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
See how I apologize to the book.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
I think it's, uh, some thirty-one, thirty-two days since the beginning of these hearings.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Uh, that's the first time I ever saw him.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
I'm not sure that I was introduced to him that day, but throughout these hearings.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Would you feel in the car on the basis of your presentation, Mr. St. Fred,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
how long does he know about it?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
He will be part of our household commission of the Army.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Uh, yes, and what?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Uh, Stephen on the basis of his presentation.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Yes, sir, I will.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
On the basis of today.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
I know this is the thing,

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
I will arrange a discussion with respect to that telephone call of my son,

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
you know, that assuming the name or the showing came up,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
that you did not propose.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Um, it's just my own telephone call.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Well, well, I so, yes, sir, that you did not propose.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Uh, yes, sir.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
By the way, this is how I will apply to that rather interesting,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
that turns you to strong style of things.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
I really don't know, that's one of those fresh things I guess.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
Uh, would you have some conversation with two people who applied into this area?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Uh, yes, I would call.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Uh, I can do what they are.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Mr. Walter, I think.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Oh, yes.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
Now, the style of man doesn't protect, does he?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
If he's a strong style of man,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
he's not the protesting side, doesn't it?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
No, sir.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
That's how it goes.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
All right, good.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Any other questions on the side?

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
I know that's far, may I compliment you, you know,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
and this can be a strong style of man,

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
but I want to say that you're possessed of the kind of temperaments

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
that's needed in a hearing that last seven weeks.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
As a witness, I think you have all that temperaments

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
that are so necessary for survival.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
Uh, I think you have built a witness temperament.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Thanks, sir.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
You still have your sent to humor.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Thanks.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Not all of them can hold it, you know.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Any other questions on that, sir?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
That's the question you're asking.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Go ahead, Mr. Walter.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Uh, Mr. Walter, have another time.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Mr. Walter, I find that witness is often like to know

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
how long there have to be on the stand.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
And I can say if he won't write into heavy interruptions

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
that we'll easily be through this afternoon.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
But you might like to know that.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Now, Mrs. Bim, is your secretary?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
She also works for Mr. Cole,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
and she needs to be runnyed around.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
And for who, what's the other man she may pay for it from?

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Any of the investigators or comments,

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
or some comments?

30:48.000 --> 30:48.000


30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
But I suppose, generally, they take care of the other six secretaries,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
or six binoculars, is that right?

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
Well, generally, but Mrs. Bim's does do a good deal of work for them.

30:58.000 --> 31:05.000
I think that she probably does almost as much as the other girls do

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
for the investigators.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
Do you have a sort of a number two veil that you can call on

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
if you are short on time available by Mrs. Bim?

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
Well, I can call on any of them, however I can't remember

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
as anyone that Mrs. Bim was in fact.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
Well, and I take you as the executive director,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
or whatever your title may be,

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
you have the power to command the center of the health for yourself

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
when you want it to you now.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Yes.

31:39.000 --> 31:45.000
You are indicated here, and I have nothing but admiration,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Mrs. Cohn, I'm sure it is, that everybody in this office works

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
long hours in hard.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Is that right, sir?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Yes, sir?
