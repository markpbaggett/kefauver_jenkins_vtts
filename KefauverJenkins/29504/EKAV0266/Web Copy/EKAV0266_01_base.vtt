00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
What was there about private shine that would lead a rational person to think, sir, that a little tidbit could move around such powerful forces as general?

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
I think that you're talking in circles here, Mr. St. Claude.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Well, maybe you're talking in circles.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Maybe I'm trying to...

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Maybe I'm trying to...

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Well, what I'm trying to say here is that general...

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
The general lawton situation was something aside from shine.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
Mr. Adams was trying to tie the general lawton situation in with the shine thing.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
That's what I say.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
That's what I say, yes.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
That's right. I'm suggesting to you it's a rather ludicrous suggestion, isn't it?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
That's...

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
That's it. It probably is.

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
And it's even more ludicrous to operate, get that to a private in exchange for calling off the work of this subcommittee, isn't it, Mr. Car?

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
It didn't work, I guess, maybe it's ludicrous.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I didn't make the suggestion, sir.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
No, but you're testifying, too, it aren't.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm testifying to what happened, what I heard, and what I know, sir.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
And here you are testifying as a reasonably intelligent man making two absolutely ludicrous suggestions.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
I think that, uh, John Adams is a reasonably intelligent man.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I think on occasion C has made ludicrous suggestions.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Isn't it true, sir, there's something about private shine.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
That doesn't make these suggestions as you put them, so ludicrous.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
You know, what were that people?

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, a little faith in front of private shine, and I'm using your words, and I don't mean to suggest that I agree with them.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
In fact, had enough power to cause these things to happen, did it not?

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Uh, it didn't happen, maybe, Mr. Adams thought that, uh, in what I don't know.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Well, what would there be about private shine that would lead this reason, we intelligent man, to think?

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
That a little tidbit tangled in front of him would cause the work of a subcommittee to cease,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
because the general would be broke.

02:10.000 --> 02:18.000
Uh, I don't, I can't say what Mr. Adams was, I think Mr. Adams was trying.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
He, he tried many times, many, many ways.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
He was trying.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
He's rather a feeble effort, sir, aren't they, Mr. Kern?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
No, they were feeble, uh, he didn't succeed.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
No, they didn't succeed.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Did you have any questions?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Cheryl, pass, any questions?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Am I right?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Questions to my left?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Mr. Cohen, I'm the president.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Why should I?

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
The important question, regardless of what Mr. Adams was, we were just even very well-behaved.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
The course of the hearings weren't affected one hour or a, for anything, uh, they didn't,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
they didn't, they didn't, they didn't, they didn't, they didn't, they didn't utilizing the law,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
the law's correction, you were the first.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Mr. Clare, I want to ask a question.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Do you have another question?

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
And by the same token, the private child received no special treatment from the army.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Uh, I think the general Iran is specified that he hadn't there, okay.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
So that if Mr. Adams is correct that this committee through its chief counsel and other

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
sought to get preferential treatment, this committee didn't get it.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
All that occasion, do you not?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
December 17th, yes.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
There were hearings that morning in New York, whether or not Mr. Clare.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Yes sir.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
You attended them?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Yes sir.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Did you have a discussion with Senator McCarthy?

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Either before, during or immediately after those hearings about private child?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Um, no sir.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
It has named come up at all.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Either before, during or immediately after the hearing.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
No sir.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
Now you testified that you and Mr. Cohn met with the Senator and Mr. Adams at Gasmen's

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Red Cron after the hearing to move.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That's correct.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
You testified as I remember that Mr. Adams and the Senator were already there.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That's correct.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Can you tell me about what time of day it was?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Who?

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
It would be rough, but the hearing's where in the morning they started 10-30.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
Probably somewhere between 12 and 1, maybe 130, months of time.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
Now when you sat down, you said I think that there was some general conversation and then

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
the Senator said in the fact that Mr. Adams had brought up the subject of general law.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
You would call that?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Uh, yes sir.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I don't mean that it's mistreated, have I fairly stated your testimony?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Yes I think that's correct.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
Was this general conversation of long duration or just how do you do that?

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
I don't recall specifically, I know that there was general conversation before this came up.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yes.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Well did this come up rather quickly in the conversation?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't think it came up too quickly if it may have.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
I'll recall, I know, uh, uh, we ordered lunch here as they would talk about what we were

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
under each other's general conversation.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I see.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Well the first serious subject then discussed was that it's been a lot, is that correct?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I think that's correct.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
And would you say that the Senator made his observations all both after he'd ordered?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Is it blunt?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
No, I can't tell you the way.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Well as a matter of fact there were some other people present weren't there?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Yes, there were other people present for a serious time.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
And did this conversation take place at any time while they were there?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Now which conversation, the general conversation?

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Well I thought so, that was the only conversation.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I'll know.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
It'll all back.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
It'll take it all back.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
My fault.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
We have too many generals.

06:34.000 --> 06:43.000
Now when these people were there, is that the period of time and what's the, um, as we say, general conversation just like?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Yes, that's your own my recollection.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Was it after they left that the subject had done a lot and came up?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I think it was.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I think it was.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
You think that was the case?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I think it was.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Now it's been there.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Now you're a guest.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
I don't know.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Your testimony was.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
That's the guest from the Senator.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Touched off a monologue from Mr. Cone.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Uh, yes.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
Now I don't know whether it's immediately Mr. Cone, uh, I got the floor but it's a monologue followed this.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Well, I think I'm quoting you directly when I say you testified yesterday.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
You touched it off.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
All right.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Oh, oh, oh.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
And that indicates does it not to you and to me that that was an immediate reaction on the part of it with Cone.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Uh, yes.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yes.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Uh, oh, oh.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Go on, boss.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And that was after these other persons had left, Dr. Wray.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Now it's my recollection after that last.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Yes.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
You're not too sure?

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Uh, I wouldn't state that a positive ring of the.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
You wouldn't.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
You're not too sure?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Uh, I just wouldn't state positively.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I'm pretty sure.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
All right.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Now how long were you in the restaurant?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Uh, I don't know.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
The usual time has takes these lunch.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Uh, no, it's still Mr. Adam's been through a couple of trains.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Is it not?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Uh, he said he did.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm not sure.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
You're not in the position to deny it, are you?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Oh, I wouldn't.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I was one who wouldn't deny it, of course.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
How long do you think you were there?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Oh, I would say.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Uh, I don't really know, probably an hour, 45 minutes.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Uh, maybe a little bit.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
There are just two hours.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Uh, it might have been.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I don't think so, but it could have been.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
I'm not sure.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, an hour, 45 minutes is what you believe it was.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Uh, I'm not really not sure enough.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Did this model all continue throughout the duration of the lunch?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Uh, well,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
it's my recollection that it continued.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Uh, perhaps somebody got a word in once in a while.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Uh, but, uh, pretty much, uh, yes, pretty much.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
And did it continue from the rise up town to Mr. Adam's got out of the car?

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, no, there, I'm not sure that it was, uh, only Mr. Cohn who was talking.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I think the Senator may have said something.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Uh, I think I may have said something.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
This is the first time you have served Mr. Cohn to take the floor on a question of general law, isn't it?

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Uh, I'm not sure this is the first time I've had a servant take the floor.

09:18.000 --> 09:27.000
So I've heard him take the floor on the, on the subject of, uh, possible reprisals against the person who has helped the committee.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Uh, we have had, uh, eight had instances about before and other investigations conducted.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, this whole matter has been gone over before and the end of November had it not.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Now, what whole matter is that?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
The question of general law.

09:41.000 --> 09:50.000
Uh, the question of general law, uh, came up to my first knowledge, uh, concerning, uh, any action of possible action.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
The concerning law, it came up, uh, in November around Thanksgiving time.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Yes.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
And didn't you learn that he had been required to submit a written report to the secretary?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Uh, I didn't learn that, uh, no, not a fact.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
He didn't learn that.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
He didn't learn that that report was stated in November 25th?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
No, I don't think I learned that.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
He didn't learn that the secretary accepted that report.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
No, sir, I don't think I learned that.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
Now, you testified, there was a monologue and I guess a rather animated one.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Well, I've carried it through lunch and perhaps far as it arrived.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
Well, uh, I was, no, I think I testified that, uh, although, uh, undoubtedly some interruptions,

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
but, uh, all on the same subject.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Uh, yes, on the same subject.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
All on the same subject.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm sorry, I probably am.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
And that the only question about shine was an attempted interruption by Mr. Adams.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
That's my recollection, yes.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, do you want to state positive, sir, that that is what happened?

10:46.000 --> 10:55.000
That, uh, that the only talk about shine was this, uh, this, uh, attempt on Mr. Adams to bring it into the conversation.

10:55.000 --> 11:05.000
Uh, I think that I could say, uh, that that's the only, only mention of shine that was, uh, made that, that day.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
You say positively.

11:07.000 --> 11:16.000
When you say positively, I'm not sure that I would want to say that to, uh, somebody who might have, uh, mentioned him, uh, might have said something,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
but I'm, I'm pretty sure that's the only time.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
You're pretty sure?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yes.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
You have no reservations about that.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
No, sir.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Well, now what time was it when you left the Senator out at the Waldorf historic?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't know, was it, was it following the lunch?

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
Hey, it's probably 20 minutes for driver's term, maybe 25.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I don't know what time was it.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Uh, I don't know, it's the middle of the afternoon, sometimes.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
And you got out and I guess the Senator got out and Mr. Cohn got out.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
No, it's already called, uh, the Senator got out.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Uh, I continued uptown with Mr. Cohn.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Uh, where did you go?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
He dropped me further uptown.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Where did you go?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Mr. Cohn was making a speech as I recall.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
All right.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Uh, uh, another speech.

12:03.000 --> 12:21.000
Uh, that, uh, that afternoon, at some high school, uh, up in the Bronx, I drove up with him, uh, I think, I think that, uh, following the speech, I went somewhere and I met him later.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I met him again, that night.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
You went with Mr. Cohn to this high school up in the Bronx, is that right?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yes.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
And, uh, that speech, uh, was delivered and then you went someplace with him for a supper?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
No, I, I think I left him.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
If I recall, I think I went to Christmas shop.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Christmas shop?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I think so.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Did you know that the Senator was going on a trip that afternoon?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yes, I did.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
And he took the plane out, uh, and went for a several days.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Uh, yes.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
You know what, tell me that?

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
No, but he went, he went to, uh, uh, Chicago, I think.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
You know what time he was supposed to leave?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
No, I really don't.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
You know what time he checked out of the hotel?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
No, I don't.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
You testified yesterday that the Senator called you on the telephone to talk with you about time.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
You recall?

13:10.000 --> 13:19.000
I think I testified yesterday that I called the Senator on the phone and I now recall that, uh, I called the Senator from up in the Bronx on the telephone about, uh,

13:19.000 --> 13:28.000
other matters, uh, one matter being, uh, uh, for my information, how long he was going to be out of town and things like that.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And, uh, what made you call him there?

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Why did you ask him when you were writing up town, Mr. Carr?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, uh, I just can't answer that.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I don't know.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
He just don't know.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
I don't know.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
He just suddenly spucked you, Mr. Carr.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
If you better find out about Mr. Shine, is that right?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Uh, I don't know.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
I just can't tell you, Mr. Carr.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
You just can't tell me.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Do you have a phone?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
No, I mean, Mr. Shine.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Call them and they better repeat the question.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
I've got you, what made me call Senator McCrawff at that time.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
That's right.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
You can get to talk to him about five times.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Or would you repeat the question?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
No, we have to.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
We have to.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
We have to repeat the question to him, please.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yes.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
The question is, what suddenly struck you, Mr. Carr?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
You better find out about Mr. Shine, is that right?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
No.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Nothing.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
But what was it made you call Senator?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Certainly after you left him off the whole town.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
You've been with him all the whole new time, haven't you?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Well, I read at this point, I really can't say.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
We have that.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
What else I could say?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, is that, uh, I probably forgot about something that I should have talked to him about.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
And that was Private Shine.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
No, it wasn't, sir.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Well, that's what you talked with him about on the telephone when you called him from the Bronx.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
That's one of the things we talked about.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
And as I testified yesterday, I believe it was a Senator who mentioned Shine's name to me.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
What were the other subjects you talked about?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
You may answer the question time he's fired.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Yes.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
The one subject that I recall was the length of time that Senator McCawffy was the out of town.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
And I believe there was something about the report.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
That's about all.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm sure there was something else.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Daniel, you said something so good about it.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You have Dr. Chairman, my announce.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
The next session of the hearings will be at 2 p.m.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Now, boys and girls, they should start the conversation with Boarding.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Mayor, please come to our office.

15:49.000 --> 16:00.000
I'd like to welcome, I guess we have come to the committee to see one of the closing sessions of the committee hearings we hope.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
In all, again, we're happy to have you here to watch your conversation.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
And the Chair wants to remind you of the standing rules of the committee,

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
which is to forbid any audible manifestations of approval,

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
any applause, any other audible manifestations.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
I have asked if the uniform members of the act report themselves while here.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
They take extra precautions today.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
And that's being trained close people scattered in the audience among you.

16:38.000 --> 16:45.000
Also carry out the admonition of the committee today to remove immediately from the room.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
Anyone who in any way violates the standing order of the committee.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
We welcome you, as I get.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
We expect you, of course, and assume that you will,

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
comply with the rules of the committee.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
If for any reason you'd be left to violate them, and they're escorted from the room,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
it is virtually as you're on invitation.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
By understanding, I'm sure,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
that when you continue to have the splendid cooperation,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
which has marked these proceedings throughout,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
with what a very few gift of it.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
As we concluded this morning, Mr. Welch,

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
I'll make sure that you have just eliminated 10 minutes go round.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Am I correct? Very well.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
So, we'll start now.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Mr. Poo, it has any questions?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I have.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
I, sir.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
On the behalf of the column, I'll go through the comments floor.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I just want to introduce you.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Any of the senators on our left, any questions?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Or to my right?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
If not, Mr. Croner, I'll send them a call to any questions.

17:42.000 --> 17:49.000
If not, Mr. Welch, I'll make sure that you have some questions.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Mr. Croner.

17:53.000 --> 18:02.000
You will receive them in your direct testimony that some question was raised concerning some telephone calls,

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
or a telephone call made by you to stop the codeus of the stratum, do you call that?

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Yes, sir.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Now, I believe your testimony was,

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
that was primarily, those calls were primarily dealing with general law.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
That's right.

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
I think my testimony was that I recall one call, and that was dealing with general law.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Yes.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
Are you able to fix the dates of the call?

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
No, I think it was the one on the 20th, however.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
I'm not sure.

18:45.000 --> 18:55.000
Now, this was during the period that you were running down the rumors with respect to private charge with the doctor's testimony.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Mr. Croner.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
No, I don't think so.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Well, you recall you have a member after my infancy, the 21st, is it?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Yes, sir.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
And you're calling the south to codeus on the day before the atom of 20th, wasn't it?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Yes.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
So it was during the period that you were running down the rumors, is that right?

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
I don't think so, but you can feel it.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
It's in that little as it is in that period of time.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
That's right.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Now, what did you think, Mr. Croner?

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
Mr. Croner, the atoms were going to be able to do about general law from out of the south to codeus.

19:38.000 --> 19:47.000
I didn't call Mr. Adams, as I recall it, to find out what he was going to do about the bottom of the wellers in south to codeus.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
But what was your conversation with Mr. Adams as you say was about general law?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Well, I don't recall the entire conversation.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Well, the best.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I would give it to the best member, isn't it?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Right.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
I recall that I called General Lawton, excuse me.

20:04.000 --> 20:17.000
I called Mr. Adams to find out if any action was going to be any immediate action was going to be taken concerning general lawton.

20:17.000 --> 20:25.000
Do you mean to say that after the monologue on the 17th, there was any question about any action being taken about general lawton?

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Well, I don't know what the Army might have done.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Well, on the 24th of November, the question had been raised.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
That is not?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Yes, sir.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I think it has.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
General Lawton wasn't relieved then, was it?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
No, sir.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
And you say it was raised again on the 17th of December?

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Yes, sir. General Lawton wasn't relieved then, was it?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
No, sir.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
What a good thing, Mr. Adams, knew out in south to codeus that could be of help to you about general lawton.

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
Well, at this point, I don't know what Mr. Adams might have known, uh, why was it in south to codeus?

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
You don't think that's our way just for pure curiosity, do you?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I know, sir.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I can explain why I made the call.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Well, would you please?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yes.

21:07.000 --> 21:21.000
Mr. Collins requested me to find out from John Adams what, when, what and when, uh, an act any action on this removal of lawton would take place.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
If it would take place immediately, uh, at this point, I don't recall whether it was concerning the next few days.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
Or whether I immediately met, uh, within a period of hours or a period of a week.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Uh, Mr. Adams was in south to codeus.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Uh, in order to find out, I called him out there.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
What did Mr. Adams say to you?

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
Had I recall, he said that he didn't think any action would be taken immediately.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Uh, I, that's my request.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Mr. Adams told you that, writing back on the train on the 25th of November.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Did he miss the car?

21:58.000 --> 22:07.000
Uh, yes, but this is now December, and a question came up again, uh, at least on the 17th.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Right, sir.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
So Mr. Adams said he didn't know anything about it.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
There it is.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
No.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
Uh, Mr. Adams said that he was, uh, uh, I don't.

22:20.000 --> 22:29.000
I'm not recalling it specifically enough to say that he said that he would not be removed immediately or within the next few days.

22:29.000 --> 22:39.000
Well, whether or not he said that, uh, you know, he said what's definitely missed, that he, uh, will or he won't be, uh, within a matter of time.

22:39.000 --> 22:48.000
I know that he told me that he did not think, uh, he would be removed, whether he made it real positive, I don't know.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Was the name shine mentioned at all?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I don't recall that it was.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Would you say definitely whether or not it was?

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
Uh, I think that I could say definitely that it wasn't.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
My best recollection is that it wasn't.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Uh, I, I'm almost positive it wasn't.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Well, now it's a telephone record show that you've in fact made two calls without the code.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
And would you say that you made two calls about General Law?

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
I, I'd say that yes.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
You recall the second telephone conversation?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Not at all.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I recall the telephone conversation itself.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
I believe it's correct.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
The record show is one on the 23rd of December as well.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
That's what I understand.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
You have no memory of that one, though.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
I recall, uh, well, it may be the one on the 23rd that I remember.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
It means you know, one on the second, one telephone conversation.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
You don't recall the second one at all?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
No, I don't.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
But it has been that you thought about shine on the second one?

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Uh, I don't think so. I think it would be called.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Well, you don't remember it, do you?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I don't remember.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
So you don't know what the set do?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Not sure.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Now let's move into January.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Do you recall the date when the Royal divorce

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
your first call?

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
I think it was January 18th.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I think that's correct.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
On January 17th, Mr. Coleman and Florida.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I think so.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
You're going down this that day of the day, three, you said, you know?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Uh, I'm not sure.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
We haven't been there very long.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I don't think you had no.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm not sure.

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
I think there was a conversation in New York in his office about which there's a school of 1414, that's right.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
You have any ideas and strike that?

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Mr. Cullen returned on the day that the Lord of Florida called, you know?

24:43.000 --> 24:53.000
Uh, he was here when, on the 19th, I believe, uh, the day that Mr. Adams came in.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
That's right.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
As a matter of fact, he came in the evening of the 18th.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Uh, I think that's probably true.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
You know why he came back for certainly?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I guess, I think I do.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Well, perhaps you should tell us.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
All right.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
Uh, he came back in connection with one of the reports.

25:09.000 --> 25:21.000
Uh, I believe it was the voice of America reports, which was the last one of the series that we were pointing out during the periods from, I think.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
Uh, the last week in December, right up to the middle of late January.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
This is one day's sharing work done.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Uh, yes, yes.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Day's sharing was in 4 to 2, was he?

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Uh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
You what?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yes, I do.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Day's sharing didn't come back, did he?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
No sir.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Mr. Cullen came back.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Yes.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Was there something wrong with the report?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Uh, something wrong with the report?

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
Yes, that's rather strange to me, Mr. Cullen would go down the floor if her day was doing it, and suddenly get back here for a report.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Was there something wrong with her?

25:52.000 --> 26:00.000
Well, first, the first part of the question, uh, I don't think it's strange that Mr. Cullen would go to the part of her day or two.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
Uh, the second part of the question, uh, is there a fair about it?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I'm sorry, that's all right.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
The second, now I just want to explain that.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Sure.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
The second, the second portion that, uh, has very cold, and this is a recollection.

26:18.000 --> 26:32.000
Mr. Cullen had given me, uh, somebody on the staff, I think it was me, uh, an outline of the final part of this last report.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
This was, uh, this was in as far as I was concerned.

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
Now, he asked that one of the staff members, uh, write it, and fill it in, uh, and get it ready.

26:42.000 --> 26:51.000
Now, uh, as I recall it, he telephoned from down in Florida with some, uh, dictation on that.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
I think, uh, I don't know who this is, I think this is just to tell you that it's one of the girls in the office.

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
Uh, it didn't go over very well on the, uh, telephone.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
He didn't like what had been done.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Uh, he said he'd come back up in front of the shootout.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
This was a report, uh, again, Mr. Shine was working.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Mr. Shine had worked on Mr. Cullen.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Mr. Shine didn't do the dictating over the telephone.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Well, Mr. Cullen did that.

27:22.000 --> 27:30.000
Well, the first thing that happened, uh, for Mr. Cullen's return, was the call for the voter board, Mr. Cullen.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
Well, now that I think the call had been made for the Lively board for shooting dead, what day was that?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Uh, the 18th.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Well, that's the 19th.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
How odd.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
All right.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Mr. Adams, uh, actually a third of the 19th?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I think the 19th.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
The afternoon of the 19th.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Uh, the 19th, I'm not sure, I'm only here.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
I'm having a decline, uh, the good.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Uh, the chair was out for any questions, and the time they used to know of.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And my right?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
From the coffee, Mr. Cullen?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Cullen.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Cullen?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Uh, proceed, Mr. Cullen.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I have a ten minutes.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Did you have any thoughts?

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
I think just to set the record straight, my information is that the Lively board, they're actually called on the 19th of January.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Would you like to check that out?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Um, yes.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
The 19th of the day, Mr. Adams came in, and you're right, it was in the afternoon.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
That's right, and he was received the call the morning of the New Yorkers.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Uh, I think that's true.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Uh, in the morning, or maybe the afternoon before.

28:30.000 --> 28:36.000
Uh, did you talk to Mr. Cullen about the prospect of calling the Lively board when he returned from Florida?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Uh, no, I don't think I did.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
Did you do that on your own, or did you receive the call?

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Uh, to call the Lively board.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Uh, instructions from Senator McCaw.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I see.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
You've been discussing with him.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Senator McCaw, here.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Yes, sir.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
When did you first discuss with him?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Uh, I think, uh...

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Well, when did I first discuss calling the Lively?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Well, I think that's very bad.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
About this time, when did you first take the Lively?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
He can actually was calling them for this historic time.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
That's right.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
Uh, I think it was on the 18th.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
I think it was the 18th.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
What was the circumstance, sir?

29:12.000 --> 29:21.000
I don't recall exactly, but, uh, I'm sorry, Paul, the Senator said that he thought it was time we started getting in.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Uh, some of the members of the Lively board.

29:24.000 --> 29:38.000
Uh, we talked about the situation, and he told me to call John Adams and see, uh, if it were possible to bring in some of the people who were actually here in Washington, uh, before the Lively board.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
Was it kind of clear that if you know, sir, that the Chief Council, Mr. Cohn, would take part in these years?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Uh, no, as it was.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
That is, he was not too far-disappointed. You would have run it as a benefit.

29:50.000 --> 29:57.000
Well, I wouldn't say that, uh, that he was not to take part. It wasn't, it wasn't commonplace that he would or he wouldn't.

29:57.000 --> 30:04.000
Uh, the Senator was, uh, was going to be present, and I was going to be present. I made the arrangement with Mr. Adams.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
Well, there's Mr. Cohn ever missed some of the hearings in, uh, that I conducted by the 70-minute.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Yes, he does.

30:10.000 --> 30:24.000
Now, I'd like to take up with you, sir, and the questions about your telephone call, with the monitor, I think, to the R&D director.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Do you have copy of them? Uh, yes, sir.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Yes, sir.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Yes, sir.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
Uh, I have made, uh, I over looked one thing I would ask you about before we get to that.

30:53.000 --> 31:07.000
Your recall, the circumstances of the meeting of the 14th of January in which Mr. Adams testified that Mr. Cohn made remarks about wrecking the Army, and you and Mr. Cohn testified that, uh, that didn't happen in the call-out?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Uh, yes, sir.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
Were you present at all times during the conference, Mr. Cohn?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
This is a 14th? Yes.

31:15.000 --> 31:25.000
Uh, no, I think, uh, I think I've testified that during the first part of the conference I was, uh, in and out of the room once and so.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
I think your testimony was, you weren't there for the beginning. I think that's it.

31:29.000 --> 31:37.000
Well, now, how long did the conference take place in so far, in new private space?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I, I, I read.
