00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, these days we are all interested in instrumentalities

00:08.000 --> 00:13.720
of peace. We have been thinking for a long time all of us about how we can have person-to-person

00:13.720 --> 00:20.960
contact and the interest of better understanding and eventual peace relations in the world.

00:20.960 --> 00:26.880
In this Congress, there was no organization or new plan that started out with more skepticism

00:26.880 --> 00:33.440
or doubt about it, more an organization. And it turned out to have general approbation

00:33.440 --> 00:39.160
and approval in the peace corps. But we've all heard so much about in which we're so interested

00:39.160 --> 00:44.960
in. We're very honored today to have with us the man who has organized the peace corps,

00:44.960 --> 00:51.400
who is its general director, who's giving it the very wonderful direction. It is taking

00:51.400 --> 00:56.760
in many nations of the world, Sergeant Sreb, Sergeant Surgat, who have you with us today,

00:56.760 --> 01:01.960
and who have talked to my people in Tennessee and other states that may be listening and watching.

01:01.960 --> 01:08.360
Thank you, Senator. I'm very happy to be here and have this chance to tell the people of Tennessee

01:08.360 --> 01:12.520
on your program something about what the peace corps is doing and what it hopes to do.

01:12.520 --> 01:17.160
Before you do that, we all call you Sorge. And everybody thinks that you might have done

01:17.160 --> 01:22.680
a sergeant in the Army or something, but actually you weren't a sergeant where you.

01:22.680 --> 01:27.640
No, I wasn't, but it just happened to be my name, but I do make the point that Sergeant

01:27.640 --> 01:32.920
is the highest rank in the peace corps. We have very few actual generals or admirals,

01:32.920 --> 01:36.440
but actually I think you were a lieutenant commander in the Navy weren't you.

01:36.440 --> 01:41.640
That's right, yes I was. And I may say incidentally, a very successful businessman who has given

01:41.640 --> 01:52.920
up his business to devote it to this very great cause. Well, Sergeant, Tennessee has been playing

01:52.920 --> 01:57.400
a very important part in the peace corps not only as the daughter of our junior senator,

01:57.400 --> 02:02.680
of our Senator Senator Gore and Nancy on one of your good volunteers and the very star,

02:02.680 --> 02:07.480
isn't it? That's right, Nancy's worked at our headquarters and the beginning has done a fine job too.

02:07.480 --> 02:13.480
And then I believe Sam Babitt, who is the Dean of Students at Vanderbilt University,

02:13.480 --> 02:19.800
is part of your organization. Yes, I'm happy to say he is no longer the Dean at Vanderbilt. He's now

02:19.800 --> 02:24.840
working full-time for us. He had a very successful and distinguished career in that work at Vanderbilt.

02:24.840 --> 02:31.000
He did not. That's a great loss to Vanderbilt, but it's a great game to you. And then I believe

02:31.000 --> 02:39.960
Dr. Nicholas Hobbs, who was the, or maybe is the professor's psychology at the Peabody University,

02:39.960 --> 02:44.440
was head of the selection group for the peace corps was enough. Yes, that's true Senator.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.920
And I think Nick Hobbs deserves a great deal of credit for the early success, which the peace

02:48.920 --> 02:55.240
corps has gained overseas because the payoff so far as the peace corps is concerned is how well does

02:55.240 --> 03:00.920
it do in the foreign country after the volunteers get there? How well does the volunteers do their job?

03:01.480 --> 03:07.080
And Nick Hobbs was the person responsible for the selection of all the peace corps volunteers

03:07.080 --> 03:15.000
who are overseas now. And we were talking about the Dean of Students at Sam Babitt,

03:15.640 --> 03:21.080
the Dean of Students at Vanderbilt University. Yes. Well, we're proud of the part that Tennessee

03:21.080 --> 03:26.440
is playing and has played. Now tell us just what does the peace corps do? What is your plan? What

03:26.440 --> 03:31.400
is your program? What has your success been? Yes. Well, the peace corps today is operating in 12

03:31.400 --> 03:35.800
different foreign countries. Right now we're concentrating in the area of education,

03:36.520 --> 03:41.880
in health, in agriculture, and in the various skilled crafts such as the Carpenters,

03:41.880 --> 03:47.720
Laborers, Plumbers, etc. For the most part so far we've concentrated in the education area.

03:47.720 --> 03:53.160
And I include in that all kinds of education, primary education, high school, university education,

03:53.160 --> 03:58.680
agricultural education, home economics, and so on. It doesn't all just take place in a classroom.

03:58.680 --> 04:02.680
And a person to qualify does not have to be a teacher in the sense that they have a teaching

04:02.680 --> 04:08.360
certificate here in our country. We've taken a great many bachelor's of arts or bachelor's of

04:08.360 --> 04:14.520
science, graduates of good colleges in our country and made them into very effective teachers in

04:14.520 --> 04:19.240
Africa and South America and over in Asia. Well, how are they getting along, Sergeant? Well,

04:19.240 --> 04:24.680
they're getting along wonderfully well so far. The best indication Senator of their success is

04:24.680 --> 04:30.040
the fact that every one of the countries where the peace corps is now operating has asked us to double

04:30.040 --> 04:35.320
or triple or even quadruple the number of peace corps volunteers in those countries. And I

04:35.320 --> 04:40.280
certainly was a recommendation now. Do you go into countries unless they ask you to and

04:40.280 --> 04:45.560
unless they welcome you and unless they cooperate with you? No, we don't. We insist in fact that we

04:45.720 --> 04:51.720
be invited before we go and in a cost-conscious country like ours, I think it's interesting that every

04:51.720 --> 04:58.760
one of the nations has already voluntarily contributed money and services and other goods to the

04:58.760 --> 05:03.560
peace corps. Without us even asking them for it, for example, one country has supplied all the

05:03.560 --> 05:08.680
housing. A large part of the public transportation around in the country that we have to use has

05:08.680 --> 05:14.440
been given to us. Other forms of equipment. One country in South America has provided almost a

05:14.440 --> 05:23.320
million dollars worth of their equipment to us voluntarily. Well, I guess of course some of

05:23.320 --> 05:28.440
these are developing nations and living conditions might not be very any too pleasant. They may have

05:28.440 --> 05:34.760
many hardships. Do you have many complaints from the people in the peace corps? Well, we've been

05:34.760 --> 05:39.720
lucky so far. The people who volunteer for the peace corps in the first instance are very well

05:39.720 --> 05:44.520
motivated, highly motivated individuals and they know before they go overseas that there are going

05:44.520 --> 05:49.320
to be problems and difficulties. But so far we've been lucky. For example, in the area of disease,

05:49.320 --> 05:53.560
many people thought that there would be a lot of accidents or disease in many of these countries.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.680
The United States Public Health Service is responsible for the health of the peace corps volunteers.

05:58.680 --> 06:03.560
They have told us that they, the public health service has been surprised at the

06:04.440 --> 06:09.080
small amount of disease which has afflicted the peace corps so far. We're very lucky that one.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.040
How many do you have in the peace corps at the present time in that sergeant? Well, it's changing almost

06:14.040 --> 06:21.720
hourly as we make this telecast senator between Thursday of this week and Monday of next week,

06:21.720 --> 06:29.480
333 new volunteers will go into training with the peace corps. So as of today we have about 700 overseas.

06:29.480 --> 06:35.080
We have 200 in training and over this weekend we'll put another 300 in training. So if you add

06:35.080 --> 06:39.800
all that up it comes with about 1200 people. And I heard you say somewhere the other day that

06:39.800 --> 06:45.880
only less than a half a dozen had asked to come home. Is that correct? That's right. We've brought

06:45.880 --> 06:53.480
four home from overseas. One was what we call compassionate case because this boy's father died and

06:53.480 --> 06:57.720
they had a large number of brothers and sisters. His mother needed him back to help support the family.

06:57.720 --> 07:02.600
Another one was the famous postal card girl from Nigeria. The girl wrote the postal card and

07:02.600 --> 07:07.560
creates such a ruckus at that time. Yes, she is a very kind girl too. I'm sure. Well, she was a fine girl.

07:07.560 --> 07:12.200
She was a magna cum laude graduate of Smith College in Sudan. At least she had been trained

07:12.200 --> 07:16.680
at Harvard and she's still working for the peace corps. I'm happy to say she's in our Washington

07:16.680 --> 07:20.520
headquarters and in June I think it is. She's going to be married and perhaps she'll be able to

07:20.520 --> 07:24.360
continue to work for it. When I say you have a lot of volunteers it doesn't mean that anyone who

07:24.360 --> 07:30.600
volunteers can get in does it serge? No, it doesn't. So we're getting new volunteers now at the rate of

07:30.600 --> 07:36.600
2000 a month. So we expect that between January and June for example about 12,000 people will volunteer

07:36.600 --> 07:43.080
for the peace corps. We probably won't take more than 3,000 of those. So about one out of every four or

07:43.080 --> 07:49.160
one out of every five applicants gets in. Are they mostly college graduates or young people or

07:49.160 --> 07:55.960
what kind of people are? About 80% are college graduates now. But we hope that many more people who do not

07:55.960 --> 08:02.920
have a college degree will volunteer for the peace corps. Countries overseas need skilled craftsman,

08:02.920 --> 08:09.400
construction people, automacanics, diesel engineers, nurses, laboratory technicians, practical

08:09.400 --> 08:13.240
nurses and so on. And many of these people don't have college degrees. They don't need to have a

08:13.240 --> 08:17.640
college degree. What's more they don't have to speak the language. We teach them the language.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.440
I can ask you what kind of training do they have before they go say they're going through some

08:22.440 --> 08:29.240
nation and Africa, South America, Asia, what kind of training do they have? Well they get I think the

08:30.600 --> 08:36.120
really rare type of training in that we give training in the culture, customs and traditions of

08:36.120 --> 08:40.600
the foreign country towards their going. We train in the language. We teach them about American

08:40.600 --> 08:45.960
history and government and politics. We give them physical education. We give them health education.

08:45.960 --> 08:50.200
So that when they arrive in the foreign country, they arrive there knowing the history and the

08:50.200 --> 08:54.760
culture of that country. They know the language of the country and the job that they're going to do

08:54.760 --> 08:59.240
in that country has already been selected for them. They know what kind of work they're going to do

08:59.240 --> 09:05.000
and they've been prepared to do that work. It starts so often in connection with our diplomats and

09:05.000 --> 09:10.040
it may not be justified. There's a complaint that they just live to themselves and they big

09:10.040 --> 09:15.720
capitals of the city of the countries they go to. How about the members of the peace corps? Do they

09:16.680 --> 09:21.240
get out and mix and live with the people and get to know them and work with them directly?

09:21.240 --> 09:25.960
Well Senator, that is one of the basic requirements of the peace corps namely that our personnel

09:25.960 --> 09:31.000
live with the natives or the citizens of the foreign country that they're living in.

09:32.280 --> 09:39.480
I'd say 85% of all peace corps volunteers live outside of the capital cities. The only ones who

09:39.480 --> 09:44.920
live in a capital city are people who are teaching for example at a big university in the capital city

09:44.920 --> 09:49.720
in Bangkok. The big university as you all know it called Chula Longcourt University. We have 10

09:49.720 --> 09:55.880
men on the faculty of that university. So they do live in Bangkok but most by far the great majority,

09:55.880 --> 10:00.280
maybe 80 to 90% of our people live in the rural communities of various countries.

10:00.280 --> 10:05.800
Of course ours, the peace corps has only been going for just a few months but from people coming

10:05.800 --> 10:11.240
from countries where peace corps has been operating it seems to me that it's already paying great

10:11.320 --> 10:14.840
dividends what has been your experience or what's your report?

10:15.560 --> 10:20.200
Well we agree that some of the most encouraging things have been articles written on the peace

10:20.200 --> 10:25.800
corps by foreign journalists and by foreign celebrities even like Arnold Toyne be the famous

10:25.800 --> 10:30.440
British historian, voluntarily wrote an article for the London Times which was printed all over

10:30.440 --> 10:36.440
the world, commending the peace corps and telling about the volunteers that he had seen. The

10:36.520 --> 10:41.720
Associated Press, the United Press, the British news gathering agency called Reuters.

10:41.720 --> 10:46.120
All of these people have interviewed the peace corps and have talked to experts about the

10:46.120 --> 10:50.520
peace corps in foreign countries. We have no way of controlling what they publish or say

10:50.520 --> 10:56.280
and uniformly so far the reports by these nonpartisan third party groups have been

10:57.000 --> 11:02.600
favorable to our operations. I know that the peace corps goes to a lot of neutral countries and a

11:02.600 --> 11:08.520
lot of newly developing countries. I understand you have a number of peace corps people in the

11:08.520 --> 11:13.320
Philippines which is a friendly nation. Why would you send a peace corps representatives to a

11:13.320 --> 11:19.240
friendly nation? Well maybe I'm all fashioned but I believe in making better friends of the

11:19.240 --> 11:24.120
friends you already have. I agree with you very thoroughly. There seems to be sort of a

11:24.120 --> 11:28.840
tendency in some quarters to think that you only do business with people that you might lose

11:29.480 --> 11:33.560
that the neutral nations are so-called neutral nations are the ones that you should curry

11:33.560 --> 11:38.520
favor with. Well I'm in favor of working with the neutral nations. We have people in Ghana and

11:38.520 --> 11:43.320
other neutral nations but still in all I think that one of country has proven its friendship for us

11:43.320 --> 11:48.440
and they're trying to follow the democratic free way of life and to have trade with us and so on

11:48.440 --> 11:52.440
that we should try to help them too and the Philippines is an outstanding example in the Pacific

11:52.440 --> 11:57.560
of this type of favorable of country favorable to ours. I heard you say where they had 45 different

11:58.840 --> 12:03.960
languages or dialects and that they were all being told English. Yeah that's true because

12:03.960 --> 12:08.760
the in the Philippines one of the essential ingredients for keeping those islands together as a

12:08.760 --> 12:14.440
nation is that they have a common language and the only language they have in common now is English.

12:14.440 --> 12:19.160
Also we've often heard and talked about the fact that the Philippines should be a symbol in the

12:19.160 --> 12:24.200
far east of democracy at work but we forget sometimes that the only way that the Philippines can

12:24.200 --> 12:28.680
communicate with the rest of the Asia- a rest of Asia is an English. If they don't know English

12:28.680 --> 12:33.720
they can't talk to the people who live in Thailand or even up in Formosa so English is essential.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.720
It's been wonderfully accepted in the Philippines is that not true? Yes that's true.

12:37.720 --> 12:42.520
Well what are the communists there about the Peace Corps? What's their reaction? Well it just

12:42.520 --> 12:48.600
happens that yesterday I got a new publication issued and printed in China. It has mailed say

12:48.600 --> 12:53.320
Tongue's picture on the cover and it's distributed all over the world this particular copy happened

12:53.320 --> 12:58.360
to be picked up in Africa and there was a long article in there blasting the Peace Corps saying

12:58.360 --> 13:03.640
that we were a tool of imperialist aggression that we were nested of spies that we were out to

13:03.640 --> 13:09.000
subvert the people's liberties all over the world and it was indicative to us at any rate that the

13:09.000 --> 13:14.120
communists don't like the Peace Corps and they don't like the Peace Corps I'm pleased. That's a good

13:14.120 --> 13:18.920
sign you're doing a lot of good. Well how much is the Peace Corps costing this year for instance?

13:19.160 --> 13:23.560
Well the Congress gave us 30 million dollars as senators you remember and that will be enough

13:23.560 --> 13:29.240
to operate us through the first year and to bring about 5,000 Americans into Peace Corps service.

13:29.240 --> 13:34.360
Right now we're asking for another 30 million dollars in addition to the first ones to bring

13:34.360 --> 13:38.760
in an additional 5,000 people and we've been very much encouraged because the committees here on

13:38.760 --> 13:44.040
the hill have supported our request so far. Liberals as well as reactionaries well I wish we could

13:44.040 --> 13:49.160
go on but that's all the time we have. I want to thank you very much Sergeant Shriver for telling the

13:49.720 --> 13:55.960
viewers of this program about the Peace Corps that's all until next week.
