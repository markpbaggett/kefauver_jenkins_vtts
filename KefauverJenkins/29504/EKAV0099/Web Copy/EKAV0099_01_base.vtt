WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we in Tennessee and in the Tennessee delegation

00:08.160 --> 00:14.240
are very proud of some of our distinguished Tennessee and to occupy half places in the

00:14.240 --> 00:17.040
federal government here in Washington.

00:17.040 --> 00:22.840
I'm sure that you're familiar with all of these gentlemen.

00:22.840 --> 00:28.640
For instance, Bill Henry, who comes from Memphis, is the chairman of the Federal Communications

00:28.640 --> 00:29.640
Commission.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.480
Joe Swidler, who used to be with the Tennessee Valley Authority and a lawyer in Tennessee

00:34.480 --> 00:37.280
is chairman of the Federal Power Commission.

00:37.280 --> 00:43.760
But a man that I have been more closely associated with and I expected over Tennessee is better

00:43.760 --> 00:48.480
known for many many reasons than most anyone else is.

00:48.480 --> 00:53.880
None other than Paul Randixon, who is the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

00:54.880 --> 01:02.120
We are very glad to have you around on our program today and to have you speak to the

01:02.120 --> 01:06.280
listeners over this station and to you many friends in Tennessee.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.080
Nice to be here with you, Senator.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.040
It's always a pleasure to be around you.

01:11.040 --> 01:17.760
May I say by way of background that Rand comes up a very fine family at Davidson County

01:17.760 --> 01:26.400
in Nashville and I remember that he used to be the old Southern half back on the Vanderbilt

01:26.400 --> 01:29.160
football team for four years.

01:29.160 --> 01:34.360
Rand I think that we used to, this Vanderbilt football team used to play Tennessee once

01:34.360 --> 01:35.360
in a while.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.880
Didn't you and you were over there?

01:36.880 --> 01:37.880
Yes, sure.

01:37.880 --> 01:38.880
I went to Knox for many times.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.040
I didn't come home happy very often.

01:41.040 --> 01:47.720
Well, as I remember, the back of those days you used to win one game once in a while.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.320
I was on one team at Beat Vanderbilt, in fact.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.320
Beat Vanderbilt.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.320
A Beat Tennessee.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.840
I think it's in 1935.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.920
It's about the first time in ten years we've beaten Tennessee.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.080
Well, of course, I was just a few years after I had been at the University of Tennessee.

02:05.080 --> 02:11.160
But I remember I used to go back to all the Tennessee Vanderbilt games and you were a great

02:11.160 --> 02:12.160
heart back.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.520
It was a great joy to watch you play, but I was always led to see you come out on the,

02:16.520 --> 02:19.120
usually come out on the losing side.

02:19.120 --> 02:28.000
Anyway, friends, Randix has always taken an active part in Tennessee affairs, here in

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Washington.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.640
Of course, he goes back to Tennessee quite often.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.640
He's been there many times with me.

02:34.640 --> 02:40.240
He was there for two years, the president of the Tennessee State Society, here in the

02:40.240 --> 02:41.240
nation's capital.

02:41.240 --> 02:45.720
And I think it was one of the most successful presidents we ever had.

02:45.720 --> 02:53.040
And then along about six or seven years ago, I got to be chairman of the Antitrust and

02:53.040 --> 02:55.480
Monopoly subcommittee.

02:55.480 --> 03:02.280
This is committee in which we investigated high price of drugs and worked out a drug act

03:02.280 --> 03:08.240
where you worked on other monopoly and antitrust legislation carried on investigations of the

03:08.240 --> 03:13.800
kind of cost of steel, bread and many other things.

03:13.800 --> 03:20.320
So I was looking around for the very best man I could get to be the Chief Counsel for

03:20.320 --> 03:23.080
that staff director of that committee.

03:23.080 --> 03:29.800
I finally able to persuade Rand to come and be our Chief Counsel and staff director, which

03:29.800 --> 03:34.800
he was before he went down to be chairman of Federal Trade Commission.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.160
Ron, how'd you ever get to Washington in the first place?

03:38.160 --> 03:43.360
I remember when I graduated from Vanderbilt, Josh Cote, he took me down to Florida with

03:43.360 --> 03:45.360
him as an assistant football coach.

03:45.360 --> 03:52.160
I finished my law there and as soon as I graduated, I came looking for a job really.

03:52.160 --> 03:57.760
And when I got here, I met a great Tennessee and a great friend of yours, you know, Judge

03:57.760 --> 04:02.640
you and Davis, who was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and he hired me.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.440
And so that's where I started with them.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.520
Yes, I remember Judge Ewing Davis.

04:07.520 --> 04:14.040
He's a great Tennessee and he was a congressman from one of the middle districts of Tennessee

04:14.040 --> 04:19.960
for many, many years and was made chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.240
When was it you joined the Federal Trade Commission around?

04:22.240 --> 04:24.840
It was in about July 1938.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.720
And then I think you had a hitch in the Navy for him?

04:28.720 --> 04:36.480
I've been to the Federal Trade Commission.

04:36.480 --> 04:42.200
Well, some people may not understand the great importance of the Federal Trade Commission

04:42.200 --> 04:46.760
and the business and the consumers.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.920
I tell us generally about the work of the Federal Trade Commission.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.320
I don't know of any of these.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.720
First place, how many members of the Commission are there?

04:55.720 --> 04:59.320
Well, it's a five-man commission.

04:59.320 --> 05:03.800
No more than three can be a member of one political party.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.040
The terms are for seven years.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.040
I suppose you remember one of the political parties that I remember.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.880
I'm a good, strong Democrat.

05:12.880 --> 05:19.680
And of course, you know, this agency was formed in 1914, created 1914.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.280
Then it was created to help preserve the free enterprise system.

05:24.280 --> 05:28.880
They followed through with the old Sherman Act that was passed in 1890.

05:28.880 --> 05:35.600
By the time 1914 had come, I think Congress had learned by that time that many of the problems

05:35.600 --> 05:43.120
that ultimately resulted in Sherman Act actions or causes of action should be dealt with

05:43.120 --> 05:44.120
in the beginning.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.640
And so they created the Federal Trade Commission.

05:45.640 --> 05:52.000
Otherwise, the Sherman Act, which was passed in 1890, was during the time of the great

05:52.000 --> 05:57.600
rubber barons and the big trust and so forth, and was for the purpose of trying to break

05:57.600 --> 06:00.920
up monopolies and cartels after they had been formed.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.040
That's quite a problem once it's happened.

06:03.040 --> 06:09.840
And then the idea of the Federal Trade Commission Act, among other things, was to try to prevent

06:09.840 --> 06:13.680
these monopolies and cartels from getting formed in first place.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.680
The things that lead to them, I'm sorry.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.560
In the Incipient System.

06:17.560 --> 06:24.600
I remember when I was on the House Judiciary Committee, way back in the 40s, that Judge

06:24.600 --> 06:31.600
Ewing Bay was used to come up every year in urge that a loophole in the Clayton Act

06:31.600 --> 06:35.600
be, which the Federal Trade Commission administers be plugged in.

06:35.600 --> 06:41.920
That is, that corporations could join together by buying the assets of one another, but they

06:41.920 --> 06:45.680
couldn't join together by buying the capital stock.

06:45.680 --> 06:53.040
I mean, they could buy the stock, but they couldn't start off by the assets.

06:53.040 --> 06:59.520
So that one corporation just by the assets of another and nothing would ever happen.

06:59.520 --> 07:05.800
I worked with you and we finally got the so-called Cellar Chief Overbill Pass, which plugged

07:05.800 --> 07:08.120
that loophole in 1950.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.720
That's one of the laws that you administer.

07:10.720 --> 07:16.080
I share a certain of their tough one to deal with, because these are mixed, as you know,

07:16.080 --> 07:17.480
more than anybody else.

07:17.480 --> 07:22.720
They're mixed questions of fact, law, economics and everything.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.000
You know what's interesting about that law?

07:25.000 --> 07:30.960
All the time and the effort that you and Congressman Cellar put into the passage of this amendment.

07:30.960 --> 07:38.840
It's taken until just this year, practically, before we really fully understand it, because

07:38.840 --> 07:44.600
with the Browns you decision, the Supreme Court really underwrote the legislative history

07:44.600 --> 07:45.600
of that act.

07:45.600 --> 07:51.720
I've never seen a decision that quite was this specific in adopting the philosophy of the

07:51.720 --> 07:53.800
legislators in its past.

07:53.800 --> 07:59.520
Well, then, finally, it's been pretty well defined by the court as to what it means.

07:59.520 --> 08:06.320
And that is, that one corporation cannot require the capital stock or assets of another if

08:06.320 --> 08:10.720
it's going to suppress competition and tend to create a monopoly.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.240
And it may substantially lessen or tend to create a monopoly.

08:14.240 --> 08:20.400
And this doesn't mean, you know, it's a misunderstood statute, as you probably will know.

08:20.400 --> 08:24.960
Many people think this just says no one can merge, and that certainly is not the law, because

08:24.960 --> 08:26.320
many mergers are desirable.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.320
That's right.

08:27.320 --> 08:33.320
It's those tight mergers that have this effect that you spoke of that must be eliminated.

08:33.320 --> 08:39.200
By administering a section seven of the Clayton Mac, which is the merger provision, is

08:39.200 --> 08:44.400
a very small part of your remarkable work with the Federal Trade Commission.

08:44.400 --> 08:51.000
And I think all businessmen, the chambers of commerce, know that you've brought new

08:51.000 --> 08:55.640
life and new vigor and a new outlook to the work of the Federal Trade Commission and

08:55.640 --> 08:58.040
trying to help small business.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.880
Would you tell us something about that, right?

08:59.880 --> 09:05.600
I'll go back to those four years that I spent with you as your counsel on your animal

09:05.600 --> 09:08.800
monopoly subcommittee.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.640
I remember the many instances of letters that you would get and would all be referred to

09:13.640 --> 09:20.480
you by other senators asking the question that, well, the Federal Trade Commission or

09:20.480 --> 09:25.840
the Department of Justice, Anitrust Section has preceded against my constituent.

09:25.840 --> 09:30.080
Now I'm doing no more than the other competitors are doing.

09:30.080 --> 09:35.280
Why can't they proceed against all of them instead of me or us let me alone or us get

09:35.280 --> 09:37.160
them all?

09:37.160 --> 09:42.280
This taught me a very good lesson, Senator, because traditionally for some 40 some ideas,

09:42.280 --> 09:48.280
the Commission had preceded case by case, hoping that once it was completely litigated

09:48.280 --> 09:54.480
and approved by the High Court, that if someone else was doing the same thing, they would

09:54.480 --> 09:56.720
voluntarily stop.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.960
This hasn't quite worked out.

09:57.960 --> 10:02.160
But actually a great long time to go through all the courts and all the other ones would

10:02.160 --> 10:03.160
be busted by that.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.160
That's correct.

10:04.160 --> 10:09.800
So when I went there, I thought that maybe the time had come for the Commission to try

10:09.800 --> 10:16.800
to use new innovations to try to move against a substantial group against the practice instead

10:16.800 --> 10:22.160
of the one-violator, if they were all doing it for whatever reason caused it.

10:22.160 --> 10:26.240
We should try to do it as equitably as possible now.

10:26.240 --> 10:33.440
Also I think that we brought one other innovation there that is, if you remember when the very

10:33.440 --> 10:42.520
sponsor such as President Wilson in 1912, 1314 when he sponsored the Federal Trade Commission,

10:42.520 --> 10:47.120
he had many things to say among which was that there should be created some agency where

10:47.120 --> 10:53.620
the businessman could come to and seek some kind of guide and send advice if possible

10:53.620 --> 10:57.800
before he found himself in the throws of litigation.

10:57.800 --> 11:04.440
And starting last July, and just a little over a year ago, we've offered this service to

11:04.440 --> 11:10.760
every American businessman that comes within our statutory obligations to come and if we

11:10.760 --> 11:12.840
can we'll give them this advice.

11:12.840 --> 11:19.760
Let me see if I understand if a businessman wants to start some new kind of practice.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.080
Also you have control over...

11:23.080 --> 11:24.880
The Edmund Proper Advertisement.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.880
The Proper False Advertisement.

11:27.880 --> 11:33.720
If they, rather than take a chance on doing something, you offer them the service of

11:33.720 --> 11:37.440
coming and giving them an opinion what you abide by.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.920
Which is binding upon us.

11:38.920 --> 11:43.720
We will not change our mind unless we give them an opportunity to change theirs.

11:43.720 --> 11:51.120
Well, I think that's very fun and should service and should be highly applauded as the business

11:51.120 --> 11:54.760
community cooperate with you in this rank.

11:54.760 --> 11:59.240
So they have been very receptive to this.

11:59.240 --> 12:03.840
In fact, the Chamber Commerce, when they recently met here in the nation's capital, has

12:03.840 --> 12:07.600
to resolution endorsing this effort on our part.

12:07.600 --> 12:14.560
And as long as we can do this and do it well, I think that will be better for our system

12:14.560 --> 12:19.480
because if a man, as you say, is going to spend millions and dollars on advertising campaign,

12:19.480 --> 12:23.280
he shouldn't have to take a risk if there's some way it can be resolved.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.680
Any questions before?

12:24.680 --> 12:32.760
Well, Rand, you're also administer the Robinson Patman Act, which is very important for

12:32.760 --> 12:33.760
small business.

12:33.760 --> 12:38.840
That's part of the Robinson Patman Act that amended the Clayton Act, which is commonly

12:38.840 --> 12:42.680
the price discrimination, the discrimination section.

12:42.680 --> 12:48.400
We exclusively, practically, enforce this law because justice has pretty well left

12:48.400 --> 12:49.400
this to us.

12:49.400 --> 12:54.880
Well, your attitude in the Federal Trade Commission is to have good healthy competition, but

12:54.880 --> 13:00.960
not to have one fellow doing something improper to his competition.

13:00.960 --> 13:06.280
We hold ourselves centered out as the servant of business.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.240
Of fair business, every businessman wants to be fair.

13:09.240 --> 13:15.080
And we want to help them to eliminate those unfair practices that destroy and hinder good

13:15.080 --> 13:16.480
competition.

13:16.480 --> 13:20.520
We also want to do our dead level best for the consumer.

13:20.520 --> 13:24.480
You know, we have these four consumables that we enforce.

13:24.480 --> 13:31.520
So, for textile and inflamible fabrics act, this is the enforcement to see that the labels

13:31.520 --> 13:37.600
and the representations that Mrs. America goes in the store and read are true.

13:37.600 --> 13:44.200
And the Federal Trade Commission is against price fixing on any kind of basis, feeling

13:44.200 --> 13:45.200
it.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.200
Is that right?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.200
That's right, sir.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
That's the law of the line.

13:48.200 --> 13:52.640
The Supreme Court said, price fixing is illegal per se, and we enforce that.

13:53.520 --> 13:59.040
Ladies and gentlemen, I know you have enjoyed seeing and hearing from the chairman of the

13:59.040 --> 14:05.040
Federal Trade Commission, a great Tennessee and from Nashville, who is one of the finest

14:05.040 --> 14:08.880
public servants that we have in the Federal Government today.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.880
That's all for now until next time.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.200
Goodbye.
