WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.040
Yes, sir. I think we are now. And I think whatever appellations that I inadvertently or

00:11.040 --> 00:18.680
virtually have added to you, I think it's right to be that he will not be a person that

00:18.680 --> 00:25.880
would be very dictatorial in your office or very, how, or, unopportunable, is that right,

00:25.880 --> 00:26.880
sir?

00:26.880 --> 00:32.600
I have an objective leader up to justice, sir. And I suspect that you, well, indeed, I

00:32.600 --> 00:37.720
hear you all using each other's first names, the fat rights. That's quite common, yes.

00:37.720 --> 00:44.560
And I wish you to know I'm, I think, at the night, way to run it off. And I take it to

00:44.560 --> 00:51.360
strike that out. Now, when Mr. Cohen is in Washington, he stands, I guess, gather from

00:51.360 --> 00:56.240
his testimony. I think that's why I got it. And I don't assert it's not fairly true. But

00:56.240 --> 01:02.000
he stands a good hero of his time in the senators office. Yes, that's true. About what

01:02.000 --> 01:06.360
portion would you think if you know? Well, it's a little difficult for me to say here,

01:06.360 --> 01:15.040
not sure if that I asked him. He, you see, I don't know all of the time that is in right.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.120
But in there, I don't need to think we need the voices. I don't think we need to dwell

01:18.120 --> 01:24.400
on it. But you know that he's up there at the deal. Yes. And I gather from the conversation

01:24.400 --> 01:28.440
that we've had in this room that you were all so up there at the deal. Yes, sir. Are you

01:28.440 --> 01:33.440
there? Would you say you were there every day with the car? Or not? No, I wouldn't say

01:33.440 --> 01:39.440
it was there every day, nothing. But I would say that some, usually, some part of every day

01:39.440 --> 01:46.480
I'm there, but not every day. Yes. And if you are there every day, would you call the

01:46.480 --> 01:53.920
minute call or half hour call or even longer time? It's very difficult to say. I would say

01:53.920 --> 02:01.280
that this would range from maybe one minute to one day to all day stay the next time.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.840
And I think if you're on the first day in the day, just with some of the people in that

02:04.840 --> 02:08.200
office. Yes, sir. And name some of them if you will.

02:08.200 --> 02:15.200
Yes, sir. You must have worked for this hearing. I asked you not to name any of them.

02:15.200 --> 02:26.200
Simple mouth. I know the third place. Can you name any of them? I don't care about the

02:26.200 --> 02:30.200
other speakers. I don't wish to know them, sir.

02:30.200 --> 02:37.200
Well, I am. Do they want them told me I would ask you to?

02:37.200 --> 02:45.600
Nothing. There's a campaign that helps us hear anyone who works with anyone who

02:45.600 --> 02:53.600
is exposed to him and is not going to have them dig me the wires that every little girl

02:53.600 --> 03:00.600
knows. There are no. I think we don't wish to know who he is. No off the matter office.

03:00.600 --> 03:06.600
I don't know who that means. One after we saw here. He just missed a minute.

03:06.600 --> 03:15.600
And her first name I think is Mary. And you call her Mary. Yes. And of course, he

03:15.600 --> 03:22.600
called me. Now I will order. I have used some questions about the more Miranda that

03:22.600 --> 03:35.600
I didn't use in evidence here. It's a different number 31 and here's the whole of

03:35.600 --> 03:40.600
him. And what's good is just for both of us to just room once you get fired. Do you remember

03:40.600 --> 03:44.600
that, sir? Yes, yes, sir. If you got a set up, the good is the best.

03:44.600 --> 03:51.600
I think the original is not over the importance of purposes. I have a not.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.600
Because I will want to ask you about the content of some of these memorandums.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.600
Yes, sir. One second.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.600
Yes.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.600
I'm sure I do remember that.

04:14.600 --> 04:23.100
If you got one, the one that I had here that I could have handed, you quickly with Mark

04:23.100 --> 04:25.600
Cuff, oh, my thought that might be a little confusing for you.

04:25.600 --> 04:31.600
Now for purposes of convenience in the printed record of the reading, there are numbers.

04:31.600 --> 04:38.600
You observe that, Mr. Justice. And I think perhaps one of the printed ones might well be

04:38.600 --> 04:40.600
the number of the some points, sir.

04:40.600 --> 04:45.600
So the further we're going to be referred to by the women, Mr. Denise, the problems of

04:45.600 --> 04:50.600
here on. I will see that one is offered in evidence.

04:50.600 --> 04:56.600
Now if you will look at the printed ones in front of you, you will see I think that number

04:56.600 --> 05:02.600
one, which is not over second, is written by you. Is that right? Yes, sir.

05:02.600 --> 05:07.600
And the next one written by you is number four, they just December.

05:07.600 --> 05:12.600
Yes, it's written by you. They just December 9th from you into the senator.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.600
Is that right? Number five. That's right.

05:16.600 --> 05:22.600
Then six is not by you, but it's two you and Mr. Cohn from the senator.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.600
That's correct. Seven is dictated by you.

05:27.600 --> 05:33.600
Yes, sir. Eight is dictated by you.

05:33.600 --> 05:44.600
Ten is dictated by you. That's right, isn't it? Ten is my number and yes sir.

05:44.600 --> 05:52.600
Yes. And dictated by you. Number ten, I think I don't know whether this came up yesterday or not.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.600
Well, if you're the man in business, my number and yes. And it's your product.

05:57.600 --> 06:02.600
Yes, sir. And eleven is dictated by you.

06:02.600 --> 06:20.600
Yes. Now, looking at those as we, as I turn them over, first I want to ask you what happens to them generally.

06:20.600 --> 06:30.600
Let's take the first one. We understand, of course, that all these that we have talked about were dictated to this business address for one second.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.600
Yes, sir. We learned that from my head.

06:33.600 --> 06:37.600
It's a lot from the chair, very good. It doesn't mean that you didn't understand.

06:37.600 --> 06:42.600
Well, I think that's it because it's starting to get right next to the record we've heard because of the right company.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.600
That is the whole of the business company has been given to the understanding of the 50 days.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.600
This is a new production that the Army has prepared.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.600
Yes. So what we have all agreed now is the proper text to the member.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.600
Yes. It'll be understood.

06:57.600 --> 07:09.600
I think I'd ask the state for the record, Mr. Chairman, that as to number five, which is dated December 9, 1953, on the original, which is in the evidence already,

07:09.600 --> 07:14.600
the word confidential appears.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.600
And on the fitted one, it does not appear.

07:17.600 --> 07:22.600
That, I think, is the only significant difference if that is the case.

07:22.600 --> 07:30.600
Now I was asking you about these memorandum and taking number one as a sample.

07:30.600 --> 07:43.600
After that was dictated by you, I gave it, and I may be wrong, but I gave it to Mr. Tristol's testimony, that she took the trans-pribed and put it in the file.

07:43.600 --> 07:48.600
Is that no understanding, sir? That's my understanding, but testimony is.

07:49.600 --> 08:02.600
Similarly, with number five, which is from you, the best senator, you dictated that, and did not see it after dictated.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.600
Is that right? That's right.

08:04.600 --> 08:11.600
You assume, however, that you assume it was presented to the senator and then reached the file?

08:11.600 --> 08:13.600
Yes, sir.

08:13.600 --> 08:20.600
Then, as to number seven, once again, that was dictated by you, and you did not see it thereafter.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.600
I mean, for some period of time.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.600
Yes, sir.

08:24.600 --> 08:36.600
And similarly, as to number eight, from you to Mr. Colne, you dictated that to Mr. Tristol, and once again, did not see it after dictation, until some of it's considerable later time.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.600
Oh, yes, sir, that's right.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.600
And the same would go for number 10, is that right?

08:43.600 --> 08:44.600
Yes, sir.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.600
And then, number 11 is the lesson for it.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.600
Yes, once again, that would be true.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.600
Yes, sir.

08:49.600 --> 09:03.600
So in every instance, you dictated the number and it's a Mr. Tristol, and then they simply went out of your control or your site until you saw them a some later date.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.600
Yes, sir, that's right.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.600
Now, I wish to call on your attention.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.600
I think my 10 minutes is on the point of expiring, am I right?

09:13.600 --> 09:17.600
I will stop and then start again when it comes to me as a result.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.600
Very well, I don't expect this in your head, David.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.600
I expect Mr. Colne from the 20th.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.600
To work your note, Emma.

09:25.600 --> 09:35.600
Now, Mr. Carr, let me run down the list of memorandums for such a matter, or one subject in particular.

09:35.600 --> 09:41.600
Well, you look first at number one, which is your first memorandum that's dictated.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
Yes.

09:42.600 --> 09:51.600
If you will look at the middle paragraph, you will see that Dave Shines takes up about in printed lines, about half that memorandum.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
That does he not.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
Yes.

09:53.600 --> 10:00.600
And if you will look at your next one, which is December 9th, with...

10:01.600 --> 10:04.600
Shines mentioned in the first paragraph, is he not?

10:04.600 --> 10:05.600
Yes.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.600
And in the second paragraph.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
Yes, sir.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.600
And in the first paragraph?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.600
Yes, sir.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.600
And in the fourth paragraph?

10:13.600 --> 10:14.600
Yes.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.600
In other words, he's mentioned in every paragraph.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.600
Is that right?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.600
That's correct, sir.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.600
Now, we do go ahead to number seven, which is your memorandum to the senator.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.600
Dave Shines mentioned in the first paragraph, is that right?

10:27.600 --> 10:28.600
That's right, sir.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.600
And in the second.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.600
Yes, sir.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.600
And in the third?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
Yes, sir.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.600
And in the fourth?

10:35.600 --> 10:36.600
Yes, sir.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.600
And in the third.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
All right, sir.

10:38.600 --> 10:43.600
Now, take your next one, number eight, which is your next, the next one, that you dictated.

10:43.600 --> 10:48.600
Which is January 9th, to Roy Cole.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.600
Shines mentioned in the single paragraph, in that memorandum, is he not?

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
Yes, sir.

10:53.600 --> 11:03.600
Now, take number ten, which is your two third, and Shines mentioned in the only paragraph, in that memorandum.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
Somebody that has?

11:04.600 --> 11:06.600
Number ten, sir.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
Number ten.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.600
Yes, that's right, isn't it?

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
Right.

11:11.600 --> 11:16.600
And in number eleven, Mr. Shines mentioned.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
All right.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.600
And in the only paragraph, in the memorandum.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
Right.

11:21.600 --> 11:33.600
What was there about Mr. Shines, as was a such infrascue, that he turns up my name in every memorandum that you ever dictated?

11:33.600 --> 11:43.600
Well, I just had a memory, every memorandum I have a dictated that, he turns up my name in these memorandums, what you had before him.

11:43.600 --> 11:50.600
Yes.

11:50.600 --> 11:55.600
Well, I used to suggest you ask, sir, write that out.

11:55.600 --> 12:07.600
Have you told us what fascination Mr. Shines had for you, so that he turned up in every memorandum that you dictated that was saved in this case?

12:07.600 --> 12:19.600
No, but I, all I told you so far is that Mr. Shines name appeared in the memorandum I dictated, which I haven't found in.

12:19.600 --> 12:34.600
Every time I dictated a memorandum between October 2, 1953 and March 11, 1954, Shines turned up in it some way, but every time I dictated a memorandum between those states and which Shines mentioned?

12:34.600 --> 12:42.600
Well, I understand that, the ones that we have in evidence here, are you not suggesting that there are still others on us that mention Shines?

12:42.600 --> 12:58.600
No. Going back to these memorandums just generally, can you tell us who it was that decided to keep the file that I have before me about which Mr. Shines was just so specified in the first instance?

12:58.600 --> 13:01.600
I know, sir, I can't.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.600
You just heard it through like Totsy, is that right?

13:05.600 --> 13:06.600
Perhaps I don't know.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.600
How much has Totsy grown before you came to know he was an exister?

13:10.600 --> 13:13.600
Just about the size you have that.

13:13.600 --> 13:19.600
That is to say, Totsy had reached full maturity by the time he knew he existed, is that right?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
That's correct, yes.

13:21.600 --> 13:39.600
And you were writing these memorandums to the senator, and art of home, and sending them all, and by what turned out to be a pure accident as far as you were concerned, they all turned out in the same folder where you found them sometime in March of this year, is that right?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.600
Well, not exactly.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.600
Well, that's where you found them?

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
Well, no, I didn't find them there, nothing.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.600
Well, hopefully, there's just a bomb, Mr. Shines.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.600
I'm not interested in that.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.600
No, I'm not interested in that.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
I'm interested in that.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
And it was just an accident.

13:53.600 --> 14:03.600
That that neat little file, consisting of just 11 memorandums, had been preserved by her, do you, look, is that so?

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
No, sir.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.600
Well, it was nothing new planned.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.600
You find the way?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.600
Yes, I guess you can call that.

14:11.600 --> 14:19.600
So, standing past any questions, Mr. Carr here, hoping that maybe we could get through the storebusters, get back to the...

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
That's exactly right.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
That's right, that's right.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
That's right.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.600
That's right.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
Not over the wall.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
Yeah, man. That's right, Mr. Chairman.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.600
Uh, we'll find a way.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.600
I hope we can get back to the work of the committee.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.600
I'm interested in what...

14:31.600 --> 14:34.600
He's not a dumb known to be sure to know that.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.600
He's a very clever young man.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.600
Sixty-two years of age.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.600
I think so.

14:40.600 --> 14:45.600
Oh, I still think he's a very clever young man.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.600
He knows that...

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
Oh, he has that.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.600
He's the material that I still have this case.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.600
He knows that it's not my complete file, it's my office.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.600
You know that, my...

14:59.600 --> 15:02.600
I just think that the wealth is just the...

15:02.600 --> 15:06.600
Uh, fine, the issue of the case, if you're working, you have the time to work.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.600
Good as I think, but the Democrats are the Republicans here.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.600
I don't think there's any questions.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.600
I'm going to cut out some questions too, if you want to.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.600
The way off the road is not going far away.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.600
Carr believes it's a number.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.600
Yeah, I'm just touched in this tradition, which I mean, certainly,

15:23.600 --> 15:27.600
the issues of the Democrats and the environment,

15:27.600 --> 15:29.600
so it cannot oppose the point of work.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.600
You want to make a decision?

15:33.600 --> 15:38.600
Now I have heard just because...

15:40.600 --> 15:44.600
The number two in this memorandum, which is not your dissertation,

15:44.600 --> 15:46.600
is directed to the file.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.600
You observed that, yes.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.600
But number one, your first memorandum is...

15:52.600 --> 15:55.600
From new to Senator McCarthy.

15:55.600 --> 15:59.600
Number five is from you to Senator McCarthy.

15:59.600 --> 16:04.600
Number seven is from you to Senator McCarthy.

16:04.600 --> 16:09.600
Number eight is from you to Cole.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.600
And number ten is from you to the Senator.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.600
And it is not until your week's number 11,

16:16.600 --> 16:19.600
that you have just one to the file, is that right, sir?

16:19.600 --> 16:23.600
By the way, going back a little, when you've dictated these memorandums,

16:23.600 --> 16:25.600
will you try to...

16:25.600 --> 16:28.600
I don't think you need even to throw your mind back.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.600
What would you say to Mrs. Grispo?

16:30.600 --> 16:34.600
Take a memorandum to the Senator, is that what you would say?

16:34.600 --> 16:35.600
If that...

16:35.600 --> 16:39.600
Looking at the first one, probably something like that.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.600
Or would you take a memorandum from me to the Senator?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.600
Probably something like that.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.600
Well, it must be something like that.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.600
Say it for the ranking if you would, as to how you probably did say it.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.600
All you've got to do is just imagine you've got her here,

16:54.600 --> 16:56.600
and you want to dictate a memorandum to the Senator.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.600
How would you begin?

16:58.600 --> 17:02.600
Well, I'm sure that I was probably psyched over...

17:02.600 --> 17:04.600
Take a memorandum for the Senator.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.600
This is for the Senator.

17:06.600 --> 17:07.600
And that's that.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.600
That's that, yeah.

17:09.600 --> 17:12.600
And then you decide you're an indicate.

17:12.600 --> 17:15.600
That's right.

17:15.600 --> 17:19.600
Now let's look at these memorandum.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.600
And let me direct a few questions for you

17:22.600 --> 17:25.600
as to each other in the fine day.

17:28.600 --> 17:32.600
I'm going to ask you first...

17:32.600 --> 17:37.600
about the one of December 9, 1953.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.600
That's it, given by Zane.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.600
I couldn't get you on the telephone.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.600
Can you recall, sir,

17:46.600 --> 17:51.600
where the Senator was when you were trying to reach him on the phone?

17:51.600 --> 17:52.600
Most likely.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.600
In any event, you felt that you had a message for him

17:56.600 --> 17:58.600
that you wish to get to him,

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
reason to be pompous, that right?

18:00.600 --> 18:03.600
Oh, I think that's right.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.600
I call your attention to the seconds,

18:06.600 --> 18:09.600
psyched that out, and in February,

18:09.600 --> 18:11.600
there was a memorandum from Mr. Cohn,

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
the Senator, on this same day.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.600
Is that correct?

18:16.600 --> 18:18.600
Being number four?

18:18.600 --> 18:19.600
Yes.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.600
Did you know that Roy Cohn was writing that memorandum?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.600
No, sir, I don't think I did.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.600
Did you so far...

18:25.600 --> 18:27.600
Did he so far as you know,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.600
that you were writing your memorandum?

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
No, he didn't.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.600
They were separate memorandum then.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.600
Just individually inspired.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.600
Is that right?

18:39.600 --> 18:43.600
I assume you're right, yes sir.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.600
Now, I think you told us the other day,

18:45.600 --> 18:47.600
by the way, that there were two reasons

18:47.600 --> 18:49.600
for that my car is either writing a memorandum,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.600
is that correct?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.600
Yes, I think so.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.600
One being record?

18:54.600 --> 18:55.600
Yes sir.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.600
And one being a...

18:58.600 --> 19:01.600
a conveyer message?

19:01.600 --> 19:04.600
I think that's probably right, yes sir.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.600
Now, look again at this memorandum

19:06.600 --> 19:09.600
of December 9th.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.600
Yes sir.

19:11.600 --> 19:16.600
By the way, is that the day on which there was a hearing in this room?

19:16.600 --> 19:19.600
I think that's right sir.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
And this...

19:21.600 --> 19:24.600
I guess we well remember is the third floor, is that right?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.600
Yes sir.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.600
And your office is on the first floor, is that right?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.600
Yes sir.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.600
And you dictated this memorandum in the Senator's office.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.600
Yes sir.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.600
And that's on the fourth floor.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.600
Yes sir.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.600
I call your attention to these words.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.600
Again the day John Adams

19:45.600 --> 19:51.600
came down here after the hearing.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.600
What?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.600
Where does came down here mean?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.600
So I turned down here mean,

19:58.600 --> 20:00.600
down to my house, but my office.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.600
Down to one old one, right?

20:03.600 --> 20:06.600
It also means came down here to the point

20:06.600 --> 20:09.600
where you were dictating this memorandum, doesn't it?

20:09.600 --> 20:10.600
No, doesn't it?

20:10.600 --> 20:13.600
Again John Adams came down here.

20:13.600 --> 20:18.600
What else does that mean except room 101?

20:18.600 --> 20:21.600
It doesn't mean room 101.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.600
It does.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.600
Where are you dictating a memorandum?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
What you say?

20:26.600 --> 20:29.600
Use the word here.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.600
dictating the memorandum and showing them a copy of it.

20:32.600 --> 20:42.600
Then you should say John Adams came down to 101 instead of saying came down here should you not?

20:42.600 --> 20:45.600
I might have been better.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
Sir?

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
It might have been better.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.600
It would have been a lot more accurate wouldn't it?

20:49.600 --> 20:51.600
I don't think it would have been more accurate but it would have been better.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.600
Well if you were actually dictating this memorandum on the fourth floor,

20:55.600 --> 21:00.600
is it a happy phrase to say John Adams came down here after the hearing?

21:00.600 --> 21:01.600
No sir.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
No sir.

21:02.600 --> 21:07.600
Well they're going around so we have the opportunity.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.600
Thank you sir.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.600
Thank you sir.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.600
Come on in the car.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.600
Thank you.

21:11.600 --> 21:18.600
Come in the car.

21:18.600 --> 21:25.600
Come in the car.

21:25.600 --> 21:32.600
Come in the car.

21:32.600 --> 21:38.600
Come in the car.

21:38.600 --> 21:45.600
The first paragraph of that memorandum has these words in it.

21:45.600 --> 21:59.600
I wonder whether I am getting fed up with the way the Army is trying to use a shine as a hostage to pressure us to stop our hearings on the Army.

21:59.600 --> 22:04.600
Would you observe those words that I am getting fed up, Mr. Carr?

22:04.600 --> 22:05.600
Yes sir.

22:05.600 --> 22:13.600
I take it that means that this pressure is a shine as a hostage that has been going on for some time.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
Had it not?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.600
Yes it probably does.

22:17.600 --> 22:24.600
You wouldn't use the phrase I am getting fed up with something unless it's something that has been going on for a long time.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.600
You were getting sick of it, is that right?

22:26.600 --> 22:29.600
That's a public lecture.

22:29.600 --> 22:34.600
So that you had been undergoing this rather nauseating situation.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.600
Would I shall we say, Dave?

22:38.600 --> 22:39.600
No.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
Weak?

22:40.600 --> 22:41.600
No.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.600
Month?

22:42.600 --> 22:45.600
No, I wouldn't...

22:45.600 --> 22:47.600
I don't know whether I'd say, Dave, weak for months.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.600
Well, what was it you?

22:49.600 --> 22:50.600
Hour?

22:50.600 --> 22:51.600
No.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.600
Dave?

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
No.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.600
Weak?

22:54.600 --> 22:55.600
No.

22:55.600 --> 23:00.600
I don't know if you're curious something how long does it take you to get fed up on something of this sort?

23:00.600 --> 23:09.600
Well, it took me about, I would say, an hour and an hour and a half to realize how fed up I was on this.

23:09.600 --> 23:15.600
Mr. Adam, first told me this after the hearing outside of Room 101.

23:15.600 --> 23:23.600
At that time, I don't recall challenging Mr. Adams or saying anything to him.

23:23.600 --> 23:30.600
I guess that was even indicates that I'd later would like to send him a random.

23:30.600 --> 23:35.600
But as I kept thinking about it, and thinking about it when I was in the office, I began to get fed up.

23:35.600 --> 23:40.600
I think I'm fed up in a matter of an hour and maybe a little less.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.600
I gave you two large words every time.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.600
Maybe it was a matter of minutes, is that right?

23:46.600 --> 23:49.600
It could have been minutes.

23:49.600 --> 24:02.600
Well, I told him the only contact we were authorized to have with him about Chinese was on investigation committee business.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.600
Did you see that phrase?

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
Yes, sir.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.600
Who authorized your contact?

24:09.600 --> 24:15.600
I saw the phrase I don't say at the end of the second paragraph.

24:15.600 --> 24:21.600
I told him the only contact we were authorized to have with him about China was on investigation committee business.

24:21.600 --> 24:25.600
My question is who authorized that contact?

24:25.600 --> 24:29.600
I think Senator McCarthy and Secretary Steven.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.600
Well, certainly the Senator has.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.600
I'm sorry, Secretary.

24:35.600 --> 24:41.600
Now, look at this phrase and you've already been asked about in the next paragraph.

24:41.600 --> 24:50.600
I am convinced that they will keep right on time to blackmail us as long as China is in the army.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.600
Were you still convinced?

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Yes, I was.

24:53.600 --> 24:58.600
Did you know what Mr. Shirens tour of duty was going to be?

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
At that time?

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
Yes.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
No.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.600
Didn't you know it was going to be two years?

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
Oh, yes, and two years, yes.

25:05.600 --> 25:14.600
So you were then convinced that you were in for two years of blackmail, is that right?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.600
Well, that's what I said.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
That's what you say.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.600
Is that right?

25:19.600 --> 25:26.600
I don't know that I thought of it in terms of two years, but I said as long as he's in the army.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.600
That's not true.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.600
And he's in the army for two years.

25:29.600 --> 25:33.600
And you were in for up to him for two years of blackmail.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.600
That's the way I felt that afternoon, yeah?

25:35.600 --> 25:38.600
Not just what was the blackmail?

25:38.600 --> 25:40.600
What were they threatening you with?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.600
Is it just to keep China in the army?

25:42.600 --> 25:43.600
No, sir.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.600
What?

25:44.600 --> 25:45.600
41KT?

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
No, sir.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
All deprived of the leaves?

25:48.600 --> 25:49.600
No, sir.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.600
Are not making the car full?

25:50.600 --> 25:51.600
No, sir.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.600
What were they threatening to do to it?

25:54.600 --> 26:01.600
Well, the way I understood it and the thing that threatened me a little bit,

26:01.600 --> 26:09.600
I angered that afternoon with the fact that they tied this thing in with stopping the hearing with...

26:09.600 --> 26:11.600
I don't care what they tied it in with.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.600
What were they going to do to China?

26:13.600 --> 26:15.600
What were they going to do to China?

26:15.600 --> 26:16.600
Yes.

26:16.600 --> 26:23.600
The thing that I was concerned about here was that they were trying to use China to stop the hearing.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.600
I understand.

26:24.600 --> 26:30.600
But what were they threatening to do to even be tied, letting you wear the uniform of the United States Army?

26:30.600 --> 26:38.600
Well, I don't know if they were threatening to take them out and shoot them or anything like that.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.600
Why don't they go?

26:40.600 --> 26:43.600
The worst we've heard is KP on Sunday, isn't it?

26:43.600 --> 26:44.600
Yes.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
That's the worst we've heard.

26:46.600 --> 26:54.600
But what makes it hard did you think that you could turn aside a territorial investigation by this committee

26:54.600 --> 26:57.600
with a little kick-out about KP on Sunday?

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
No, I didn't.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.600
That was just childish to talk that way, wasn't it?

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
Well, I didn't.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
I thought that way.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.600
Well, I mean, the bad of it was just childish.

27:07.600 --> 27:14.600
Well, I'm also a boy, but he had no business trying it up with his wife stopping the hearing.

27:14.600 --> 27:21.600
But I'm assuming he tied it up to you, a grown man, to suggest that KP for China on Sunday

27:21.600 --> 27:25.600
with some way stopped the hearing most of the time that it was served.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.600
Is that right?

27:26.600 --> 27:33.600
Well, I don't want to say that anything that Mr. Adam did was childish.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
Well, it's settled.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.600
I thought it was real foolish.

27:36.600 --> 27:37.600
Yes, it's right.

27:37.600 --> 27:41.600
And then they said in your next, in that same paragraph, you say,

27:41.600 --> 27:48.600
and they keep trying to jangle upon small favors to him in front of us.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.600
That's a proposed small favor.

27:51.600 --> 28:03.600
Well, for instance, they launching on the 24th, and then again, on the train on the 25th of November,

28:03.600 --> 28:13.600
Mr. Adam's major statement for indicating that they would do little things to take care of Mr. Shines.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.600
Do little things to take care of Mr. Shines.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.600
Now I ask you, that little face.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.600
I don't know.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.600
He just don't know.

28:21.600 --> 28:27.600
Well, then when you say they keep trying to jangle proposed small favors to him,

28:27.600 --> 28:29.600
you don't know what you're talking about, is that right?

28:29.600 --> 28:30.600
Oh, yes, I know it.

28:30.600 --> 28:34.600
Well, that proposed small favors where they're going to do this last.

28:34.600 --> 28:42.600
Well, I don't know if they were favors myself, but Mr. Adam seems to think they were.

28:42.600 --> 28:52.600
For instance, on the 24th of November, he was going to, if we would give him some good words concerning law,

28:52.600 --> 28:56.600
he was going to use what he considered.

28:56.600 --> 29:05.600
His influence to get Mr. Shines off so that he could work with us on the weekend following what I consider a general order

29:05.600 --> 29:08.600
by the fact that the army could be off anyhow.

29:08.600 --> 29:13.600
That's what this is being clear this morning with weighing with you in one side of the scale,

29:13.600 --> 29:19.600
fusting a general like General Lawton against a weekend pass for a pilot.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.600
Is that right?

29:21.600 --> 29:29.600
And Mr. Adam's was still young up, so I have to say, you suggest that some way those things could counterbalance each other.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.600
Well, I'm not going to say anything.

29:31.600 --> 29:36.600
That shouldn't possibly have blackened me over the man like you put in Mr. Shines.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
It didn't, let's put someone.

29:38.600 --> 29:43.600
And him for definitely was no favor to Shines of Eddie Muff on Thanksgiving was it?

29:43.600 --> 29:44.600
No, sir.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.600
None were there. Everybody got off on Thanksgiving.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.600
I think they did.

29:48.600 --> 29:57.600
How was it looking at the next memorandum, with years to you and Carr from Senator McCartes?

29:57.600 --> 30:00.600
Is that memorandum ever with you, sir?

30:00.600 --> 30:02.600
Yes, I think I sure copy of it.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.600
A copy of it?

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
Yes.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.600
Where's the copy you saw?

30:06.600 --> 30:10.600
I don't know. I think I might have destroyed it. I'm not sure.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.600
Why did you destroy it?

30:11.600 --> 30:12.600
I might have.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.600
When did you destroy it?

30:13.600 --> 30:14.600
I say I don't know.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.600
You don't know.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.600
Did you act on it?

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Uh...

30:21.600 --> 30:22.600
No, sir.

30:22.600 --> 30:23.600
Never acted on it.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.600
No.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.600
Now, were there two copies of it actually?

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
I don't know.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.600
I say I think I'm here to have it.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.600
I have the original here, sir.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.600
Would you like to look at it?

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
No, sir.

30:35.600 --> 30:39.600
It has no indication that it was seen by a phone. Is that right?

30:39.600 --> 30:41.600
Uh, on the original?

30:41.600 --> 30:42.600
Yes.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.600
I don't think it has any indication that it didn't seem to be seen by me, but that's...

30:45.600 --> 30:46.600
No, sir.

30:46.600 --> 30:47.600
Right, sir.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.600
I have it here.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.600
It isn't marked file by you, is it?

30:55.600 --> 30:56.600
No.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.600
It isn't marked file by a phone.

30:58.600 --> 31:02.600
Did you ever have any conversation with Cohen in respect to the Memorand?

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
I don't think I ever did.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.600
I may have known whether he's out a copy of it or not.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.600
Uh, I don't know.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.600
I don't know.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.600
When you swear that he's out of copies?

31:10.600 --> 31:11.600
No, sir.

31:11.600 --> 31:16.600
For all you know now, now a low-datt number and a is addressed to Cohen and Tom,

31:16.600 --> 31:22.600
it may have gone directly from Mr. Dressful's high-batteries or just filed me a file.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.600
It could have, but I don't think so.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.600
But you don't know where yours is.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
No, sir.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.600
And you never took any action as a consequence of your thinking.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.600
No, sir.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.600
I'm in the fire and we're now at the pathway point in the afternoon.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.600
We'll stand for a five minute.

31:38.600 --> 31:39.600
We'll be there.
