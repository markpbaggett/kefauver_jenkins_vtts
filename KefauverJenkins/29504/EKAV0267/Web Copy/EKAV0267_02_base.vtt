00:00.000 --> 00:08.640
It was rather silly for John Adams to talk to you about the charges that might be made

00:08.640 --> 00:10.640
public in Mr. Cohn.

00:10.640 --> 00:21.040
I think we can all agree that the one I think is Mr. Wells' last is that I'm sure that

00:21.040 --> 00:31.600
the regardless of how silly Mr. Wells thinks the activities of Mr. Adams were that they

00:31.600 --> 00:40.320
have succeeded in falling off the investigation of communism, hummus infiltration for a period

00:40.320 --> 00:44.000
now of all three and a half or a month at a minimum.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Isn't it right?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yes sir, I have.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I have no head in Shiloh.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
I like to talk.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
So, Mr. Wells, we refer to Mr. Adams and Mr. Stephen Leffert as silly.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
I think we should make it clear that Mr. Adams and Mr. Stephen Leffert were being drafted

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
by Mr. Clifford as well.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
But there were very, very successful in their efforts to know there's no custom of that

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
as they are.

01:12.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, Mr. Wells asks you for very much getting a bit fed up with certain efforts in the

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
part of the...

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Which, Adam, there's some of the visuals.

01:27.000 --> 01:38.000
Could I ask you for very much, you may not fairly fed up with the fact that we have spent

01:38.000 --> 01:49.000
now about three and a half months investigating charges against Mr. Cohn which have been proven

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
to be completely false, but completely false.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
Now you know, all that time we have been kept off our work of investigating draft corruption

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
communism in the government.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes sir.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
There's one final question.

02:08.000 --> 02:22.000
Is the express Mr. Fahd and Mrs. Mowl a brilliant talk show about 355, 255 on the 15th day of June,

02:22.000 --> 02:34.000
1954, while our community should be exposing those who have betrayed us nation instead of

02:34.000 --> 02:45.000
that, we are going through this still-lustening procedure which has started some three and a

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
half four months ago, keeping us from disposing to the American people sedanuous to this nation.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I think that's true.

02:57.000 --> 03:06.000
Also, Mr. Fahd, Frank Fahd, we have a very limited amount of money for investigators.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
We have been very, very cheerful with it.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
The last of the day, a vast amount of that money is being spent, so vast amount of time

03:18.000 --> 03:30.000
with the centers being spent, not investigating communism corruption draft, but rather continuing to investigate

03:30.000 --> 03:38.000
charges that have been proven, I think, to the satisfaction of all of the American people to be completely false weeks ago.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I assume.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
No further questions, Mr. Schumann?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Mr. Wolf, I'm interested in very-hat ten minutes.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
Well, Mr. Kair, the hearing staff called off because the threats or the blackmail about private

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
sign work wasn't.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Well, not in any sense of the word, most of us.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
Directing your attention again to this memorandum of December 9th, you say in that I made it clear I'm

04:08.000 --> 04:17.000
reading about the middle of the second paragraph, I made it clear that as far as I was concerned, I don't personally

04:17.000 --> 04:26.000
care what treatment they gave shine, and that as far as I was concerned, he was in the army.

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
Have you any doubt that that was the so-fremely correct attitude to take?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
No, sir.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
You know that exactly the correct attitude, don't you?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Yes or no, sir.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm going to ask you a question.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Yes or no?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes or no, sir.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
And that once they shine when in the army the best thing that could have happened to him or your committee, or the army was that he should have been treated

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
precisely like every other private.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
I think that's the problem with the best thing, yes or no.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Right.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
And as you indicate in the later memorandum, it was indeed unfortunate that his work was not completed so

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
that he couldn't have gone in as simply as any ordinary poor boy.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Isn't that right?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yes, sir.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
I would like to direct your attention for a moment to the next memorandum which is number six, although you does not write it.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
That is a memorandum to cone and to you from the cemetery.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
It is dated December 17, 1953 and has to do with General Lawton.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Does that bring you back to your mind, sir?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Yes, sir.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
First I want to ask you if it is not a fact that you were in New York on December 16th.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
The day the cemetery says he dictated this memorandum.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yes, sir.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
You were at the hearing fair.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yes.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And you were with Mr. Cohn and with the cemetery.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Yes, sir.

06:01.000 --> 06:15.000
Now also I wish to ask you, isn't it a fact Mr. Cohn, that as early as November 24 and 25, this question of lawton and what was going to happen to him had come up when John Adams was in New York?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yes, sir.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
And that was the occasion on which the senator was approached about it by Adam.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
One of the occasions.

06:22.000 --> 06:33.000
And in which I think the testimony indicates that he made a very wrestling refusal to accept it on the part of the senator.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
I don't remember the testimony, but I don't think the word wrestling was used, but the senator refused.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
That's right, yes.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
To keep quiet if something happened to Lawton.

06:43.000 --> 06:51.000
And you remember there was that on the afternoon of the 25th of November that Adams telephoned this second.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
This secretary in the presence of the senator and said that the senator was certainly going to make a stink about it.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
If Lawton were relieved.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I recall that testimony.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Sir, I think there was testimony to that.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
That's right.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And you knew and you were in New York at that time too.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
The 25th?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yes, sir.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yes.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
And you knew all about that going on.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
No, I don't think I was there at the time of the song.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Well, I don't say that you just barely overhead.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I know of the song.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
But you knew there was the practice of Lawton on November 24 and 25.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Right.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
And that it was a full-fledged ruckus to use my word.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
No.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
You know, sir, I always say that there was a lot of talk about that time.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Right.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
And it was a ruckus.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
How are you?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
How are you?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I'll use your word, yes.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
If you'd like something in your own, I don't need to shove it down your throat.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
But that would be pretty descriptive, would it not?

07:50.000 --> 08:04.000
Well, the only hesitation I have is that I would use the word ruckus for something more...

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Something a little bigger than this.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah, I think I really would too.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
But what I'm trying to get in, I'm in trouble with reading.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Pointed sharp talk about it on the 24th at 20th.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yes, sir.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yes.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
Now, would you turn, sir, to number seven, which is a memorandum from you, Senator McCotter,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
dated December 21, 1953?

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
This is a memorandum to which I've already drawn your attention and which has five paragraphs in it,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
each one of which is substantial.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
I think it's completely devoted to shine.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Is that correct, sir?

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Yes, all the paragraphs are contained.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
That's right.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
That's right.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
They all have to do with Dave Shine.

08:51.000 --> 09:11.000
Have you cleared up all his books?

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Have you cleared up all his works before he left?

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
I haven't read the whole sentence, but that is certainly true, isn't it, Mr. Car?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yes, sir.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And then you add, but under the circumstances, he could not.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Yes, sir.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
And who's that presented here?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Can he keep clearing up all his works before he left?

09:36.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, this, I believe, was a reference to the fact that there was some sort of arrangement

09:48.000 --> 09:59.000
that he was going to clean up his work, or clean up some work during the two-week period after he went into the army, something to add effect.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Well, I don't think the circumstances you referring to.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I think it is.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm not sure at this point.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
You might also have been referring to the fact that they knew from the first of July, or about July 8th, that he was going to go into the army.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
No, I don't think so.

10:13.000 --> 10:23.000
It is the fact that you know now, from sitting in this room, that he had most of July and August and September and October to clean up his work.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
I know from sitting here that I know what testimony he had just...

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
And certainly, had he torn into it and cleaned it up.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
As you say in simple English here, you would have been happier.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yes, sir.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Now you're in excess.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
So you're in excess.

10:41.000 --> 10:51.000
As you know, I have, on many occasions, been pretty curt with Dave about the comp submission of Memoranda.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
You read that sentence with me, did you sir?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yes, sir.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
I have on many occasions been pretty curt with Dave about the comp submission of Memoranda.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Does that mean to you?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Does that mean to you?

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
Does that mean that there are on many occasions on which you have resting down because he weren't wasn't submitting Memoranda?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
No sir, I don't think it means...

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, it's up at the word curt for me.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
What does it mean?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Do you mean you talk to him?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
I think it means that I was curt with him about it.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yes sir.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
The only thing I, the only disagreement I had with the investor is, you say that on many occasions.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
Well, I'm first I want to know what you did to him and maybe dressing down is too strong.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
But when you use that word curt, that I have been pretty curt with him, what do you mean?

11:41.000 --> 11:49.000
Well, I think an example would be on an occasion, Mr. Shine,

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
might tell me something at one of these hearings that we were conducting in New York.

11:55.000 --> 12:08.000
Or Mr. Colme might tell me that Mr. Shine had some information at something and I would make an expression which I'm sure would be called a tubitive here.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
So the fact that why hadn't he given the Memoranda more?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Right.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And you're afraid you said would have been the tip-webbed?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I think it would have been...

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, they had been many such occasions, is that right?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
They had been so many occasions.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
And some of them in front of the Senator?

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
Perhaps, I'm not, I couldn't say that.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
Well, they must have been because you say as you know I have on many occasions been pretty curt?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, he might smell without my doing in front of him.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Sir, he might know it without my doing in front of him.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Well, I understand he might do.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
You mean you made a special point to go to the Senator and check about the fact that they didn't submit Memoranda?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
No, sir. It's just...

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Well, then did you...

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Did you dress him down or be Kirk with him in the present for the Senator?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I may have.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And on many occasions?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Well, now you say there's two things.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I do say...

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Who do you say many?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
My hub on many occasions?

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
No, all I'm trying to say, sir, is that I may have done it in the present of the Senator.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
I may have told the Senator about it or he may have learned about it some other way.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
At this time...

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
No, no, no.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
You say as you know, you must have known.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
That's what I say.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I am.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
No, I have not done it in this present, sir.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
He did it in the past.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I might have said it.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
You might have, didn't you?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Not necessarily.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
He might have known it.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I might have told him.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Any further questions from the...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Senator, is this the table?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
I like the one.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Send me the time.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Mr. Carr?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yes.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
Could you look at the testimony on page 6685?
