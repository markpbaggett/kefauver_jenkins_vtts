00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, today we have the distinct pleasure and honor

00:06.320 --> 00:12.720
of having with us as our guest, one of the most important men in the government of the

00:12.720 --> 00:20.680
United States, a man who's been known to you for his excellent coverage of news and his

00:20.680 --> 00:27.800
objective treatment of domestic news concerning domestic and world affairs over Columbia Broadcasting

00:27.800 --> 00:36.160
Company for many years. He's an old and good friend of mine. Edward R. Murray, head of the

00:36.160 --> 00:41.000
United States Information Agency, he had a certainly as good to have you with us, and very

00:41.000 --> 00:47.240
pleasant to be with you again, son of a. I know that many viewers of this program will

00:47.240 --> 00:53.880
remember the great enjoyment and benefit that they got out of watching and seeing and hearing

00:53.880 --> 00:59.080
you over a period of many years when you were with Columbia Broadcasting Company. I'll

00:59.080 --> 01:03.000
find what I'm doing now much more fascinating and I think more important than anything I've

01:03.000 --> 01:12.760
done before. Exactly what is the United States Information Agency that you had? Well, as you

01:12.760 --> 01:19.560
know, it's an independent agency reporting directly to the president. Secures its budget appropriations

01:19.800 --> 01:27.240
from the Congress as a budget this year at 111.5 million dollars. Its purpose I would define

01:27.240 --> 01:32.280
briefly and I know that you like brevity on these programs. I know everybody is very much

01:32.280 --> 01:38.880
interested in it. I think it's terribly important. I would define its purpose briefly as being

01:38.880 --> 01:45.800
to make United States policy everywhere intelligible and wherever possible, palatable. We do not

01:45.800 --> 01:51.560
operate inside this country. We operate the voice of America. We only operate here when you make

01:51.560 --> 01:57.160
a mistake and that's when you hear a lot about it. Yes, we do. We make a mistake. All the good

01:57.160 --> 02:02.920
things that you do, 99 and 9.10 percent of the time you don't hear much about in the United States.

02:02.920 --> 02:07.480
That's what when you fall on your face, that's true. That's true. Congress and the people are all

02:07.480 --> 02:13.320
over you. I work begins at the water's edge. We operate the voice of America in the shortwave

02:13.400 --> 02:20.920
radio operation. We have a television service, a film program. We operate libraries in 99 countries

02:20.920 --> 02:27.240
abroad. We operate a wireless file which sends from this country to our missions abroad about 10,000

02:27.240 --> 02:33.560
word each day, made up largely of official statements, background material, the sort of thing it is

02:33.560 --> 02:41.240
of use to our embassies and our representatives abroad. We publish pamphlets. We engage in a program

02:41.320 --> 02:48.120
to produce cheap books in translation in Latin America, in Africa, in Southeast Asia.

02:48.920 --> 02:54.520
We have cultural officers stationed abroad who handle the foreign and of exchange programs,

02:54.520 --> 03:00.200
selecting students to come to this country on fellowships. Also, arranging the leader grants,

03:00.840 --> 03:07.960
that is a program under which we bring to this country. Young editors, professors, that sort of

03:07.960 --> 03:13.400
thing, when they return to their own country, we'll be able to explain what this country is about.

03:13.400 --> 03:17.640
Its purpose is its institutions. That in essence is the USIA.

03:18.280 --> 03:25.640
Well, since you've been the head of the USIA and I may say also during the previous administration,

03:25.640 --> 03:31.880
I had an opportunity of being in the cap in some cities and foreign countries, friendly countries.

03:32.840 --> 03:38.920
And I had the impression that the pamphlets and the books, just giving the truth about the United

03:38.920 --> 03:45.640
States, what we stand for, what we're trying to do. We're much appreciated by the people, particularly

03:45.640 --> 03:51.400
the young people in those nations, and this was doing more than most anything I saw to

03:51.400 --> 04:01.080
build good relations with the people in those countries. How do you feel the program as far as

04:01.560 --> 04:06.760
libraries and information is coming along? Well, in the new countries particularly,

04:08.680 --> 04:16.680
in Africa, Southeast Asia, the hunger for something to read, the desire for knowledge, the

04:16.680 --> 04:21.720
curiosity about this country. I failed to mention earlier that we also teach English. We will be

04:21.720 --> 04:27.080
teaching English this year to about a quarter of a million people in Mexico City alone. 7,500

04:27.080 --> 04:32.360
people go to our English classes each day. That's one. And to sit and see people, and I've seen

04:32.360 --> 04:37.640
them from Latin America to Nigeria in the course of the last year, to see them sitting around at night

04:37.640 --> 04:43.640
in adult education classes, reading and discussing the writings of Tom Payne or in Nigeria just a

04:43.640 --> 04:48.600
couple of weeks ago, the Federalist papers. This is a very exciting thing because these people are

04:48.600 --> 04:55.080
trying to hammer out their own destiny. And they're looking about, for example, for newer legences.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.400
As I said, it's the most exciting thing I've ever tried to do. I've been impressed,

04:59.400 --> 05:05.240
uh, the ad that under you, the USI, is not what we would call it propaganda agency.

05:06.120 --> 05:11.400
That all you do is to try to get people in other countries a true and factual and objective

05:12.520 --> 05:20.120
picture of what we're doing here. Of course, that's in addition to the teaching programs, in addition to

05:21.080 --> 05:27.080
the student exchange programs and things of that sort. That is the way you operate it.

05:27.080 --> 05:33.720
It is indeed. And I am convinced that we have no alternative. We must tell the truth because

05:33.720 --> 05:39.960
everything we say in an open society is subject to comparison. And the Nigeria that is sent out of

05:39.960 --> 05:46.040
here, films, television, the wire agencies and so forth, all of that is available to people

05:46.120 --> 05:50.280
abroad. And therefore, if we, we must tell the truth whether we want to or not. And I happen to think

05:51.000 --> 05:55.720
that it is the only method by which we can proceed. Well, I certainly agree with you. Now,

05:56.680 --> 06:03.240
what programs does the US Information Agency carry on behind the iron curtain in the Soviet bloc,

06:03.240 --> 06:13.240
if any? Um, primarily. It is shortwave broadcasting through the voice of America. However,

06:13.240 --> 06:20.680
we will have had this year in the Soviet Union, traveling exhibits, having to do one with plastics,

06:20.680 --> 06:25.480
the whole plastics industry, the products that we produce, another with transportation,

06:25.480 --> 06:29.400
the whole development of transportation here. And one is leaving at the end of this month,

06:29.400 --> 06:34.840
having to do with medicine and the curiosity. I seem to have some knowledge of drugs. Yes.

06:34.840 --> 06:45.160
The curiosity on the part of the Soviet people about this country is really very impressive.

06:45.800 --> 06:50.360
Many of the questions that our guides get, we send along with these exhibits about 20 Americans

06:50.360 --> 06:54.600
who speak Russian fluently. And the Russians who come through with the rate of anywhere from 10

06:54.600 --> 07:01.160
to 15,000 a day are asking questions not only about the exhibit, but about the United States

07:01.160 --> 07:04.600
and how we live. And they will come up to a guide and say, how must it that suit cost you? How long

07:04.600 --> 07:10.360
did you have to work in order to buy it and so forth? And this is one of the most effective

07:10.360 --> 07:15.240
manner, methods we have of communicating with people in the Soviet Union.

07:15.240 --> 07:20.920
I think it is effective, but of course your effectiveness is somewhat limited by the extent

07:20.920 --> 07:27.400
that they will let you take the exhibits around. That is true. We also print in the Soviet Union

07:27.480 --> 07:35.080
a magazine, an article illustrated which has a circulation of 52,000. It would of course skyrocket,

07:35.640 --> 07:40.680
but we are limited to the 52,000 by agreement with the Soviet Union. They print a similar magazine

07:40.680 --> 07:46.600
in this country. But in terms of effectiveness, Senator, you might be interested to know that a few

07:46.600 --> 07:53.400
months ago in our broadcast to Yugoslavia, we ran a little contest to give away a few transistor

07:53.400 --> 07:58.920
radio receivers. And we made a few announcements over a period of one week and we received better

07:58.920 --> 08:07.720
than 18,000 letters from Yugoslavia. And then you do our programs in satellite nations such as

08:07.720 --> 08:13.080
checklist of vacuum. Yes, we operate the voice of America operates in 36 languages.

08:14.360 --> 08:20.280
We estimate our audience to be roughly 20 million, however, in addition to the shortwave broadcast.

08:21.080 --> 08:26.440
We undertake what is called a package programming that is we do tapes and records here and supply

08:26.440 --> 08:32.040
them to local medium wave stations. And there of course is where you get the audience. And we

08:32.040 --> 08:39.720
reckon our audience there to be in the area of 45 million people. I believe that on the 24th of

08:39.720 --> 08:46.040
this month, probably where the voice of America will have its 20th anniversary. That is correct.

08:46.040 --> 08:51.560
We think we're achieving maturity now. Well, I think it's one of the most valuable programs about

08:53.240 --> 08:59.560
the learning of about this country, both inside and outside the iron, iron curtain countries.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.080
And one of the great, I don't know, sensitive and important places in the world today is of course the

09:06.360 --> 09:15.640
newly developed nations of Africa. And our success or our figure there is going to have a great

09:15.720 --> 09:22.760
bearing upon the future of the world. You have, I believe, just recently returned from a two or three

09:22.760 --> 09:29.720
week visit to Africa, have you not? Yes, I did. But tell us how do you think our foreign policy and

09:29.720 --> 09:36.680
our programs are getting along in Africa? Well, I think we are doing moderately well, but I came

09:36.680 --> 09:43.400
back from three weeks, all of it in West Africa, by the way, with a feeling that there is so much to

09:43.720 --> 09:50.600
do and so little time in which to do it. I have never encountered such a combination of

09:51.160 --> 09:59.480
candor, curiosity and suspicion. Suspicion of us, suspicion of the Russian, suspicion of each other.

10:00.120 --> 10:05.080
But there is all along that coast of West Africa in these new countries. What kind of three-age

10:05.080 --> 10:10.600
determination? Well, I started the Dakar and then went down the coast to Leopoldville.

10:11.960 --> 10:17.720
And it was this determination to explode into the second half of the 20th century.

10:18.760 --> 10:29.720
Now, an appetite to read, for example, in Africa south of the Sahara, there are probably, although

10:29.720 --> 10:35.000
no one has exact figures on this, probably one copy of one newspaper per each 1,000 people.

10:36.600 --> 10:44.200
The channels of communication traditionally ran north and south, that is to Paris, to London,

10:44.200 --> 10:54.360
or to Brussels during the colonial period. So there is now this appetite to learn, I think someday

10:55.320 --> 11:00.440
a perceptive historian is going to conclude that the development of the transistor radio was one

11:00.440 --> 11:06.840
of the most important events in this century because it means that it is now possible to communicate

11:06.840 --> 11:12.520
by radio with people who are illiterate, who have no power supply, who have no money economy.

11:14.360 --> 11:19.880
I found, for example, in Guinea and Ghana, two areas that have been heavily penetrated by the Soviet

11:19.880 --> 11:27.800
Union, that there is developing a certain disillusionment with the Soviet Union because the Russians,

11:27.800 --> 11:33.320
historically in any part of the world, are miserable expatriates. They don't like living outside

11:33.320 --> 11:39.080
the Soviet Union. They don't like the climate. They drive their cars too fast. They soak up the good

11:39.080 --> 11:46.520
housing. They tend to treat the local citizens with a degree of content. I came back with the feeling that

11:47.080 --> 11:55.160
in West Africa, nothing is lost that we are always to remind ourselves that communism has not

11:55.160 --> 12:00.840
taken over outside the shadow of Russian tanks or bayonets. And that while these people are

12:00.840 --> 12:08.280
shopping around in the vernacular playing both sides of the street, that still our revolutionary

12:08.280 --> 12:14.680
tradition, our feeling that we share their aspirations and their desires, are very powerful

12:14.680 --> 12:21.240
influence in one whole area. Now, I want to say that I think it's the USIA and your intelligent work

12:22.360 --> 12:28.680
for the various parts of this agency is doing more than any other activity of the government,

12:28.680 --> 12:33.640
ensuring them the true picture of freedom and liberty and what we are trying to do.

12:33.640 --> 12:39.240
Senator, what do we mean to them? When it comes time for us to ask for our appropriations,

12:39.240 --> 12:42.840
this year I shall come back and remind you of that and hope you will use your influence with your

12:42.840 --> 12:50.600
colleagues. Well, I think you've always appreciated the fact that I think particularly under you,

12:50.600 --> 12:58.440
this agency is doing a tremendously good job. I think what we need more of is to let people in

12:58.440 --> 13:04.680
other countries know about the real United States. You're doing that. Do you feel on the whole

13:04.680 --> 13:10.680
very briefly that we are succeeding, that we are getting ahead in our effort in Africa?

13:11.400 --> 13:17.560
I think we are making very considerable progress, as I say. There is so much to do. I think

13:17.560 --> 13:22.600
there are going to be new constellations of power, perhaps new collisions in Africa. I had the

13:22.600 --> 13:26.840
feeling, as a matter of fact, at the end of this trip in Africa that maybe Mr. Dooley was right when

13:26.840 --> 13:32.280
he said anybody who isn't confused doesn't understand what's going on. Well, thank you very much, Ed

13:32.280 --> 13:37.720
Murrow. And I know, friends, that all of you have enjoyed having Ed Murrow with us today as I have,

13:37.720 --> 13:47.480
we wish you well, and you're a very important efforts there. Thank you, Ed. That's all for now. Goodbye.
