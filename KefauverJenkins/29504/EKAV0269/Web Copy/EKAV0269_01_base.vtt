00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
We're ready to begin.

00:02.000 --> 00:07.000
Mr. Denkins, you're working you back to the committee table after your stand in there.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
So see, some crew would have left until they've very fine-done while interrogating the start.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
We have Senator Massasdi back on the stand this morning.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
He's the last witness now, and we will stay with him until all members of the committee and all the attendees of council.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And ask him the last question that they have in mind.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
If he thinks that you're anything to say or any questions to ask, please start.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Mr. Denkins, I have no questions.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Mr. Denkins, I have no questions.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Well, this chair will pass his first turn and start then with Senator McClaude.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Senator McClaude has 10 minutes and there are many who have 10 minutes before.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
One of them are about there when you were on the stand.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
7-4-3 days ago, you know how to make a free move.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
You can hear it.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
How is this?

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
It would all add now, and you can hear that in the comments.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
We will miss not too much of charge of counter charge of an hour.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
We'll be fair, giving you the floor.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
And I do not want for undiligable lady to see the ink by probably going into every detail and every charge.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I have another answer for what I do want.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
The question here about some of them.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
I will read both of you in the comments.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
I will read both of them in the comments.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
We will make you feel better, let you feel better, let you feel better.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Senator, may I tell you my intention to make a right for you, Mr. Denkins?

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I couldn't understand my being in a thing or to shut counter charge.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
I do have some other interesting things you want to do that, of course, with your federal and the...

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Wait and hear you, Mr. President.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I have to be here.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
I cannot understand anything about counter charge.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I will be right back.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
I don't want any of this.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
I don't want to call this any of this.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
I thought you were going to close your first letter.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't want to ask you that last letter here.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
There is a charity now and it wasn't here beneath the island.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
That's a here, it's very successful.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Even in sector Mr. Adams.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
If I had to do some training, it was arriving Mr. Steedham.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
But certainly someone, I guess here, but just heard from the people who are going to get the...

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
...follow the board before us.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Someone who are going to get those who give perhaps a few moment coming, this special concern.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I'm curious.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Senator, may I get the President that these lines speak, there's not a deal right here in the party either.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I don't know.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
But they're not arguing about that.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I don't know what this really is.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I can't be in for the President, I still have a friend.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
But I haven't campaigned for Mr. Kripper yet.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
So you're one up on it.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
No, I'm not.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, you're fired.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
You see we're fired for Mr. Kripper again.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
I think we just as well as the government once in a while, we're only having an evidence to the care of Mr. Kripper

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
...but the 20th of the 20th place will come this second day.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
That's not cool.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
I don't think all of this says there's no sworn testimony always have a monitored call for Mr. Simonton,

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
which indicate the only doubt that Mr. Kripper was advising Mr. Bob Stevens.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, in the A.Y. call, so that Stevens was willing to come and testify, was willing to give up the information.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
But apparently Mr. Kripper is...

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
...and a legal advisor or something prevailed.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
But let us start right now. You've tried to look for a certificate in this box for this month.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I don't try to think, I'm not going to do that.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
If all I do is draw attention to the testimony, are we up for a meeting with that?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I wonder if we are.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I think so.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I know I am.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, we act to be...

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
...the testimony shown...

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I thought you had a just a monitored call.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
We had no legal adjustments.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm sorry, sir.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I said a testimony to the...

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
...the monitor call shows that...

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
...they show the number one list of...

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
...signing that we have on the occasion of the first call...

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
...refers to gang of all the equipment.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Refers to the first assessment rate is...

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
...the discussion about legal plans.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Lawyers and cops talk about the advice...

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
...so given the plan to be by equipment.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So, reading or longer call or something...

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
...I don't think you can escape the conversion of Clark's equipment.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
The chief legal advisor of President Truman...

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
...while I was attempting to take out the coming of the...

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
...Broadian somehow.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
So, he was the advisor of Mr. Stephen Roswell.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Well, he thinks the chief advisor of the Attorney General...

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
...of the United States will get the chief advisor's rent.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I don't know the money I have here.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I beg for it.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I said no, no.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
You don't know.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
You may be dead.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
But let's get back to the question.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
They do have in mind at that time...

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
...and that you believe in them.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Do you now believe that they, Mr. Stephen and Mr. Adams...

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
...will protect those who are in time...

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
...have detected 50 in the counter.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I'm not sure whether or not they knew...

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
...that they didn't know that they were...

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
...a loyal hero screening board...

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
...with their dismantling during our hearing.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
The seven swimming individuals...

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
...who are very, very common workers...

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
...like to be sick and red-eyed plants.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I understand.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I'm not saying they didn't know...

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
...I'm trying to determine if this is a charge...

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
...if you made that statement.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And only you can answer it...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
...pickshap with an implication of the language used.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
But I'm not sure if we make this very clear.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Come on.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I don't know about Secretary Stephen...

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
...to the short time he was not a foreigner.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I do know that we were in...

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
...with Mr. Adams' presence...

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
...his job with his partner, Mr. Stephen...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
...that consistently...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
...people were coming to question.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Had dinner moved in the radar plant.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I laughed.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Then even after they got by the first time...

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
...the oil he poured was again on the first mass.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
That all more threat exception.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
When they got to the Pentagon...

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
...for the old film and board...

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
...they were sent back...

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
...to work in the radar laboratory.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Now the figure we have is 33 out of 35.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
That's unofficial because...

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
...Mr. Stephen's was down to the position they could not...

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
...office to give them any figures.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Well, as a chair contingent...

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
...that's all that was removed...

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
...or suspended...

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
...and that has been reinstated...

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
...or still communist and so forth.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
So, why should he be that chair contingent?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I would like to say it's a personal...

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
...I think that from the commanding officer...

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
...that the radar laboratory...

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
...to move the man...

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
...when the first time he was a oily board...

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
...found him on the fence...

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
...and down the loyalty...

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
...securety...

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
...that that was the official reason...

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
...why he should not have been ordered back...

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
...to the radar laboratory.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I know that from action by the Pentagon...

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
...sweening board...

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
...in a flight resort...

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
...of the...

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
...born inducing the commanding officer's...

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
...up there to no longer suspect.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Senator, I may agree with you by some of these things.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I think you might want to be a little bit...

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
...surprised.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I am not complaining about it.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
I am trying to pinpoint your target here.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And a day serious as I have...

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
...regarded them.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Very certain and desired to be looked into...

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
...and I think that's what this year was for.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I was my dependent in Europe.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And since you made the charges...

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
...it's your document...

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
...I'm trying to inquire into...

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
...the seriousness of them...

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
...and your conviction that they drew on to it.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Mr. Senator, I am convinced that everything...

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
...in the fence is not a charge.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
We didn't expect this.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Thank you.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Everything in the fence is a far-frighted or a church.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm sorry, my time gets wet.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
The doctor's time I get warmed up.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
We're back for you soon.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm in the next few minutes.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Send a Jackson.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I'm the attorney.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
I want to ask a few questions with reference to this.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Now, I'll bring this to an reporter page document.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
I came initially from the FBI and was sent to...

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
...G2 of the Army in coffee, too.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I believe G2 of the Air Force.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I want to ask you...

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
...the reason why...

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
...you did not get in touch with Secretary Steven.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
At the time, the serious information came to your attention...

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
...specifically the information in the document...

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
...with reference to Aaron Coleman.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm wondering, was the reason that you did not...

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
...communicate the fact in the FBI documents, too, Steven?

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
In the spring, I'd leave a 53 when you received it...

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
...because you knew your personal knowledge of the fact...

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
...contained in the document.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
But they say some of their Jackson that I...

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
...can't help but they somewhat amused...

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
...when I was planning to just out of the aisle with Democrats.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
First one is between jail...

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
...for receiving information.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
And then you get sort of served about how I use it.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
I use that information as I thought it should be used.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
I knew that the security officers in the middle of the day...

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
...shared all of the information.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Now, let's not prefer that as an FBI document...

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
...the two-and-a-half-page document was a...

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
...resumé of a 15-page document right now...

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
...with all information deleted which might give the names of the informants...

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
...which might demonstrate any investigating technique.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
That's what it might.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, now, Senator, in all fairness, the document...

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
...has used that version of an end of the record...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
...and I have not seen the document.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Did it not?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Like you should see it.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Did it not state...

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
...well, I'm going to follow the...

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
...may views of Mr. Hoover and Mr. Bownell.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
On that part of it about what the law is saying.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Not really. We don't remember Mr. Hoover's reviews.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Well, no, I think you're pardoned.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I believe that Mr. Collier has testified.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Has he not...

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
...in connection with the interview that he had with Mr. Hoover?

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
And he said that this information should not be made public on it.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Mr. Jackson, please say...

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
...the decision of that made by Mr. Hoover...

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
...the decision made by...

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Mr. Brownell, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith...

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
...it was in a famous January 21st, me...

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
...president.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
Is it not true that Mr. Collier testified in connection with his interview...

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
...with Mr. Hoover that it should not be made public...

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
...on less the Attorney General's grant as such approval...

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
...the Attorney General being his superior.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Well, that's what he's...

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
...that's the rules.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Well, but I didn't have any...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
...I had the estimate, yeah, I didn't have the...

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
...it's not the testimony.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
It's not something.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
The one I know about the rule that...

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
...Mr. Hoover, all of a sudden, I think, is the position of the Attorney General.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Any information may have been...

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
...will only be made public...

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
...upon the orders of the Attorney General.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Yes, but it's not the testimony in the hearing that...

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
...Mr. Collier interviewed Mr. Hoover.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Mr. Collier then came back and gave the information to the committee...

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
...and he testified that Mr. Hoover...

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
...was opposed to having it made public...

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
...unless permission was satisfied in Attorney General.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I think the record is quite true.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Mr. Jackson, may I say yes, but...

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
...Mr. Hoover, the Attorney General never authorized...

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
...the publication of any material that they have planned...

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
...the appalliz, the only takes the permission of Attorney General...

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
...who is his boss, nothing like that.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I didn't mean to go into the meeting.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Let me finish up on that.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Let's not go into a lot of others.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I know you're a man or an important senator.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Well, I don't like to take too much of your time...

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
...but I think it's important here to make this clear...

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
...to the people who are listening.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
That is the day of your Hoover.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Make no decisions.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Insofar as a publication of any information...

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
...and trying to make an a heritage of white tape.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Hoover had been urging, re-arging, re-arging...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
...something that you don't know the rest is.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
There's only Mr. Brown here on the street.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Honours, his mercy, his presence...

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
...the vast information was made public.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Well, Senator, you remember that one newspaper man...

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
...said that he called up Mr. Hoover, one known...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
...to put it in his column and he...

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
...was advised by Mr. Hoover according to the report in the paper...

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
...that MPD had to be arrested immediately.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And I didn't mean to report.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, there was a reason that you did not get in touch with Mr. Stevens...

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
...because you felt that he met personal knowledge of this...

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
...indiculation.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
Mr. Jackson, this was just one part, one piece of evidence.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
And I have been very, very like a friend.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
The information was all on that, all of them, in a position...

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
...of security, let's call that.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
And you...

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
...even much more than we did about the situation.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I gave you the days to other documents, other...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
...the other post went down...

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
...in which apparently they had to turn away as a matter of...

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
...the victim of the document.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
The reason my question is...

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
...was, did you not get in touch with Mr. Stevens...

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
...because you felt that he had personal knowledge.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
This is what I'm talking about, and I want to say it in C2...

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
...but because Stephen's had personal knowledge...

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
...our information.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I wasn't much of Mr. Stevens.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Well, I think, but why didn't you get in touch with Mr. Stevens?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Was it because you felt that he had already been...

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I... Mr. Jackson, I'm trying to give Mr. Stevens all the time...

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
...and they can brief picture of the situation as well.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I...

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
...could Mr. Stevens use our bad way to serve their words?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Not only of us.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Not only of us.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Not only of us.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
...but of us.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Well, Senator McCarthy, I'm referring, of course, to the time...

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
...when you first learned this information back up, please.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Let's say April, May, whatever you said the spring, I think, or April.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
When you received this alarming information, particularly with reference to Aaron Coleman...

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
...did you then get in touch with Mr. Stevens?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
No.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
And did you...

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
...not get in touch with him because you felt he had the information anyway?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Personal knowledge of it?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
No.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Well, was it because...

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
...that you didn't feel that it was much used to getting in touch with him?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
No.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Uh...

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
...didn't you feel that here's the new man in his pecaterity army?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
New team going in, so to speak?

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Couldn't learn everything about it immediately.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
That is...

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
...the situation was as represented in the document.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
In this document that time was of the essence and you should get in touch with him immediately?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
No.

16:10.000 --> 16:20.000
Well, isn't it quite obvious that the most important thing in the situation such as this where you have information that a...

16:20.000 --> 16:30.000
...individual has worked at Monmouth, was in touch with Russian-Estenarge agents, that that information should be conveyed immediately so that such people could be removed at once.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
First information was in the hands of all of the pumpers.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
What the big thing is that I can hear you.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
I am just talking about one piece of information.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
During the course, I think you know this.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
During the course of my investigation.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I don't know if it's true.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
We receive information every day about various different things.

16:50.000 --> 17:03.000
My task, if I were to get on the phone with each time I receive information, for example, about the CIA, about atomic energy, about the Army of Warcraft, about the indoctrination questions,

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
about coming to speak, or rather coming to find the speaking.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I already have a phone.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Each time I receive a report, I have a phone all the along.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I do have a judgment.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
When I know all of that, a piece of information is the only file of Army intelligence.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
I know that those were charged with getting rid of coming to have information over one period of time.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
It would be worse than silly.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
We need to call them up.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
They don't get to know us in your file.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
The senator, Mr. Smith, has only been in office a couple of months.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
And there are thousands of documents in the files of G2.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Now, isn't the real...

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
...wing an issue here is getting these alleged subversives out of the government.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Isn't that the real objective?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
The incident is getting him out of force.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
The incident is an accident.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
But one day you see you want to send me to jail for getting you some information.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
No, no. Wait a minute.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
You never heard that day. You just don't wait a minute.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
Wait a minute. Let me ask you to point any place in the elected senator.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
What I said that I was going to send you to jail.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Now, what's that all?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
You may have a good point.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Why do you say that?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Why don't you answer?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
We're not aware of it.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I have a question.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I think I should rather be silky.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't think I don't answer to the senator's satisfaction.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
So the chance to add another question.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
The senior member...

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Well, I'm a Democrat.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
So don't interrupt.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
We're all the time in the world, yes.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
The senior member of the Democratic Party, Mr. McCormick,

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
not only here on the stand, but in speeches.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
And I'm not fitifying you for it.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
He's right to think that everyone should.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
So if I receive this information about communist and the radar plan,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
that there's something illegal about that, that there's some time.

18:59.000 --> 19:07.000
I may say I can't help but be somewhat amused when I find my Democrat friends over here.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
One day, saying that the Attorney General should find getting excited,

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
forgetting information about communism, and the next day,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
saying I didn't handle it information properly.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I handled it as best we could.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
We handled it sort of in the end result for us.

19:23.000 --> 19:31.000
That some 35 people were communist workers who were handling radar material.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
At the time we got this document, I no longer handling secret radar material.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
Now, that's as best I could do with massacres.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Well, send me all that stuff that you have to do.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I'm asking you, ma'am, I'm asking you, ma'am, say,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm only one man.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
If my three Democrats and friends had less than a committee, if they had worked with me,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
maybe we could have accomplished more.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
Well, apparently we were right, Senator, because you turned around and granted all the confessions of what's in the basis for our leading.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
And if we were wrong in leaving, why did you turn around and ask all the rules be changed?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I think I made a mistake and I'm going to get you to come back and let's give him.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
You're admitting that you made a mistake?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I did like that.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Because we've done very little work,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
besides investigating our sands.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
We'll actually be trying to create a situation that caused all this trouble.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
All happened while we were off the committee or somebody caused it.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
We were not on the committee, that's right.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Now, the next minute is a little later.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Where's the head to the next?

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
No, that is in the field after the time being because that was a statement, not a question.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I think it was a report.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
No, I have a question.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I think it was the form of trust.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
That's the timing.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
In Man's, the next time we go around.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I think it was a statement.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I think that's it.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
Before asking questions at Sendemac, I'd like to make a short statement.

20:49.000 --> 20:57.000
Monday I asked Mr. Carr a series of questions about security measures with the structure of the file with this testimony.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
I was definitely asking for information and I saw stated it that time.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
I was distressed, however, in a hearing of Mr. Carr, the sobred security situation,

21:07.000 --> 21:15.000
with respect to the files of our committee, and also to the reaction of my question to Sendemac.

21:15.000 --> 21:23.000
Mr. Chairman, each member of this subcommittee, Republican and Democrat alike, has responsibility to the people of the United States,

21:23.000 --> 21:32.000
both at law and in fact, the safeguard any classified information which rests in the files of this committee.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
Each member of this committee is equally responsible for the members of the staff of the committee.

21:37.000 --> 21:48.000
In fact, as you will recall, the Democrats only returned to this committee after it was agreed they could ensure share responsibility for all staff members.

21:48.000 --> 21:59.000
Therefore, I now demand that before the end of the day, the Department of Defense, which I just now has various representatives in this room,

21:59.000 --> 22:08.000
report to this committee as the each of the members of the staff of this committee, for the legal, investigative, secretary or administrative,

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
for whom a defense department clearance has been requested.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
With the date of such request, and each staff member for whom such clearance has been granted, with the date of such grants,

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
and each such staff member for whom such clearance has been denied, with the date of such refusal.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
I want to clearly understood, Mr. Chairman, that I am making no accusations, whatever.

22:33.000 --> 22:44.000
However, I feel it important for the nation's security that this requested information be forwarded to this committee before these hearings are terminated.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
I also request that this information be given this committee an executive session.

22:49.000 --> 23:00.000
I do not now and I never have made any accusations that any individual was a security risk on the basis of any trivial charge,

23:00.000 --> 23:10.000
and I do not want to be appointed to any public accusations against a censorous person, such as we have witnessed on occasion, indeed here.

23:11.000 --> 23:19.000
However, the investigators and other staff members have had and will have access to matters affecting the security of the United States,

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
in the course of path and future investigation by this committee.

23:23.000 --> 23:33.000
It is therefore the highest importance that this committee do all in its power to make sure that no weak security links can be found in its own staff.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
No, Mr. Senator, he has a topial heartiest red.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
No red. I could instruct the department, Mr. Senator.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
I am Mr. Wel Arabic. Glad to have to say.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the senator a few questions.

23:53.000 --> 24:00.000
Chairman Claude, may I read to you from a portion of your course of examination of secondary statements on April 30th,

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
or may I read one, three, three, five of the directors, with the whole of the middle- stomach like that?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Hello.

24:07.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't question your ability to read. I think you've been doing very well.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Well, Senator, you've mentioned that several times.

24:17.000 --> 24:26.000
I'd like to know I wrote this, remember? If you take the deputy senator out of this country and out of your area, I think you could hear me senator sometimes.

24:27.000 --> 24:39.000
May I say that if we're to have a deputy, if we were to have a deputy junior senator, I shouldn't think of anyone of my fellow head who would have to come and have a deputy junior senator.

24:39.000 --> 24:47.000
Make no mistake about it. I think Mr. Cohen is one of the most valuable men I've ever had with any committee.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
Now, what's there to be reading from the governor?

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Say it one, three, three, five of the directors. Yes, sir.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
How we set?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Oh, sir. I'm looking.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Santa McClothy.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
Well, all right. Now, what is the standard in your vocabulary?

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
The secretary's team is spying. Santa McClothy.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
Well, now, if a man gives away a secret, that would be a violation of this standard act.

25:15.000 --> 25:22.000
Would it not? Secretary Steven. You would know about that. I assume that would be correct.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Santa McClothy. Well, Robert, you are the secretary of the Army.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
Secretary Steven. That is right. Santa McClothy.

25:30.000 --> 25:42.000
Well, now, if a man or as an employee of the Army gave an unauthorized person, secret, top-decorate or confidential material, that would be a violation of this standard act.

25:42.000 --> 25:50.000
Secretary Steven, you are familiar with that. I assume that it would be Santa and it certainly sounds so.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Have I read that? Right?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
You have read that exactly.

25:53.000 --> 26:08.000
Now, Santa McClothy, as I see it, based on your own words, if a man or as an employee of the Army gave an unauthorized person, secret, top-decorate or confidential material, would that be a violation of the advantage act?

26:08.000 --> 26:18.000
An unauthorized person. Yes. I believe that some of them are over giving convictions or violates the appeal of the Army.

26:18.000 --> 26:27.000
The information would not be of such a measure as to the benefit of an enemy.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
But, thank you.
