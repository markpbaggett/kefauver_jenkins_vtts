00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
A two-nine-stage code annotated title 18,

00:03.600 --> 00:05.360
five and criminal procedures,

00:05.360 --> 00:07.160
7-0-1-16-90.

00:07.160 --> 00:10.960
Um, I have seven, nine, three.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.560
Oh, you're a bit beyond my depth.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.760
I don't have these numbers.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.160
Well, I have to step down.

00:15.160 --> 00:17.160
Whatever.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.600
And as I understand that, I could also make

00:19.600 --> 00:22.640
a illegal for any authorized person to retain

00:22.640 --> 00:24.800
any such unauthorized information,

00:24.800 --> 00:26.760
without delivering it to the officer

00:26.760 --> 00:28.800
like the government in title to receive it.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.200
No, I think you're right.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.720
I think you're right.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.520
Well, let me give you any authorized person you mentioned.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.040
I'm also an authorized person.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.040
Right.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.080
I think that's the react.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.480
Thank you.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.320
You were present for you, not when Mrs.

00:41.320 --> 00:45.080
Holley testified about the two-in-a-quarter-page document

00:45.080 --> 00:48.120
before the two have been signed by Mr. Hoover.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.720
I was privileged to meet Mr. Holley herself tonight.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.640
Mrs. Holley testified that the two-in-a-quarter-page document

00:54.640 --> 00:58.280
was more personal and confidential, the only assault.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.120
I don't know.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.400
How does one of these testimony speak for itself?

01:01.400 --> 01:02.840
I very call it.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.800
It's a sensory-led testimony.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.920
I mean, I think it's a question.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.480
Fun for you.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.600
Mr. Holley testified that the two-in-a-quarter-page document

01:09.600 --> 01:12.600
was more personal and confidential, the only assault.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.080
And that the FBI, original memorandum,

01:15.080 --> 01:18.800
was also more confidential, the only assault.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.040
Did you say that was the only assault?

01:20.040 --> 01:20.880
I don't know.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.080
That's why I'm a fan of centers.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.080
Therefore, there's a video there that reminds

01:25.080 --> 01:27.200
of anyone who's serving documents

01:27.200 --> 01:30.640
that they contain confidential information, which by law

01:30.640 --> 01:33.280
does not be given to any unauthorized persons.

01:33.280 --> 01:33.960
Is that right?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.080
Any unauthorized persons?

01:35.080 --> 01:36.800
Right.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.240
Now, you testify, having to do with your informer,

01:39.240 --> 01:40.840
I'm not asking to name him.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.960
Will the unperson employed by our serving in New York?

01:43.960 --> 01:46.280
I wait up in my testimony.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.600
And he gave this two-in-a-quarter-page document to you.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.320
Yes, and authorized chairman of an investigating committee.

01:53.320 --> 01:56.000
If you were a person authorized to receive this document

01:56.000 --> 01:57.160
under the law, there is no viable.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.560
The violation of the law.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.640
If you were not authorized to receive the document,

02:00.640 --> 02:01.520
there is a violation.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.640
And the sample is that, isn't it?

02:03.640 --> 02:04.480
No, it doesn't.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.240
It's not the same as that.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.720
Number one, I'm authorized to receive.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.560
And generally authorized of a duty to receive any evidence.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.680
No, I have nothing to finish.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.480
I honestly can't think you're authorized to receive.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.960
I won't do this question, tell you.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.480
No, no.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.680
Sunday, this is the whole meat of this case.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.760
Now, when you get into the question of secrecy versus giving

02:19.760 --> 02:23.000
the American people a fact, the chairman of an investigating

02:23.000 --> 02:26.680
committee has the duty to get evidence

02:26.680 --> 02:28.200
of wrongdoing.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.800
Everyone in the government under the law

02:31.800 --> 02:36.640
has the right and the duty to give information

02:36.640 --> 02:38.680
to the chairman of an investigating committee.

02:38.680 --> 02:43.800
And when you have as you have here, the FBI doing just

02:43.800 --> 02:45.520
a thorough job as a legitimate candidate,

02:45.520 --> 02:47.720
extra white case, I believe.

02:47.720 --> 02:51.120
Warning day after day after day,

02:51.120 --> 02:54.720
that men with communist workers were in a secret way

02:54.720 --> 02:56.720
and they were in a bad way.

02:56.720 --> 03:01.120
I believe that there was no choice on the point of anyone

03:01.120 --> 03:03.200
who knew of that information, but to give that

03:03.200 --> 03:05.960
to the chairman of some committee who did.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.080
The chairman of the Florida of the 8-mile question

03:08.080 --> 03:11.400
and then repeat the answer.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.000
The whole answer is in the whole question.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
The whole question is in the question.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
It's been done.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.720
Well, the report of a searching for it

03:20.720 --> 03:21.680
and while we have the opportunity,

03:21.680 --> 03:23.680
I'll let you know.

03:23.680 --> 03:28.680
If you are a person, author, I have to receive this document

03:28.680 --> 03:30.680
under the law.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.680
There are so violations of the law.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.680
If you are not author, I have to receive the document.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.680
It is a violation.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.680
There is a sample of that as a listener.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.680
No, it isn't a sample of that.

03:40.680 --> 03:41.680
Another one.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.680
I am author, I have to receive.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.680
Not only author, I have to receive an evidence.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.680
But it's been it.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.680
So if you're silent and I don't correct you,

03:50.680 --> 03:51.680
I have to receive the question.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.680
May I relate to questions for you?

03:52.680 --> 03:53.680
I have to send a comment.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
No, Senator.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.680
This is a whole new case when you get into the question

03:57.680 --> 03:59.680
of secrecy versus getting your mat and feet

03:59.680 --> 04:01.680
to the facts.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.680
The chairman of the Investigative Committee has the duty to...

04:03.680 --> 04:04.680
I have to receive.

04:04.680 --> 04:09.680
The chairman of the Investigative Committee has the duty to get evidence

04:09.680 --> 04:10.680
of wrongdoing.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.680
Everyone in the government under the law has the right

04:13.680 --> 04:17.680
and the duty to get information to the chairman of the Investigative Committee.

04:17.680 --> 04:22.680
And when you have, as you have here, the FBI joined just to start a job

04:22.680 --> 04:25.680
as they didn't have a clear case, I believe.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.680
One day after day after day, that man with communist records

04:29.680 --> 04:32.680
worked in the secret radar laboratories.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.680
I believe that there was no choice on the part of anyone who knew

04:35.680 --> 04:39.680
that information, but to give that to the chairman of the Investigative Committee.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.680
And you, the fact that the senator's time has expired,

04:42.680 --> 04:44.680
I would like to pass to anyone who has...

04:44.680 --> 04:49.680
I would like to pass to everyone who has been informed by Colonel Murray

04:49.680 --> 04:54.680
in respect to the senator signings and requests that the job

04:54.680 --> 04:57.680
as the defense department would be much simplified

04:57.680 --> 05:01.680
if we could have a list of the current information.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.680
The governor, the governor, has been informed by Colonel Murray

05:05.680 --> 05:08.680
in respect to the senator signings and requests

05:08.680 --> 05:12.680
that the job as the defense department would be much simplified

05:12.680 --> 05:17.680
if we could have a list of the names of the current employees

05:17.680 --> 05:20.680
of the Senator's staff.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.680
And if somebody can give instructions to give us those names,

05:23.680 --> 05:27.680
promptly, we can be more specific and obeyed with the man

05:27.680 --> 05:30.680
or at least with the death of the senator signings.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.680
So the North American soldier, the governor,

05:32.680 --> 05:35.680
the senator, all behind your death, be the death of the senator once.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.680
Can you take care of those?

05:37.680 --> 05:40.680
Mr. Ernesto, I'd like to ask the minister about this.

05:40.680 --> 05:45.680
Mr. Cohn, you have ten minutes if you want to ask your client any questions.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.680
All right, you're back. Mr. Wilson, Mr. Senkai, you're at ten minutes.

05:50.680 --> 05:58.680
Senator, I was interested in the matter that Senator Jackson opened with you.

05:58.680 --> 06:02.680
And I may be try well, but if I could just imagine I had a meeting with him now,

06:02.680 --> 06:05.680
Senator Jackson was called away from the committee table

06:05.680 --> 06:08.680
to attend the meeting of having a vote of the public works committee

06:08.680 --> 06:13.680
and I was just going to ask you, sorry, not by the head of the notice that he had gone.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.680
That would not happen every time.

06:15.680 --> 06:21.680
You recall telling the senator that you got that two-and-a-quarter page document

06:21.680 --> 06:25.680
sometimes presumably in April or May of 1953.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.680
Well, I think those first.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.680
And if we say this last, level one, was it not?

06:30.680 --> 06:32.680
I don't think it's all a day, Senator.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.680
It was a 51 document, was it not?

06:36.680 --> 06:38.680
I think it was there sometime in 1961.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.680
Yeah.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.680
Now, of course you do when that document came, like that, out.

06:43.680 --> 06:47.680
And I think you told the senator that when that document came into disrepresentation,

06:47.680 --> 06:50.680
you were much disturbed.

06:50.680 --> 06:56.680
That'll be cool, my testimony, but I certainly was concerned about it.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.680
I think you used the word, disturbed.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.680
I may have used that word.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.680
And is that act with? And you were disturbed?

07:02.680 --> 07:05.680
Yes, I'm always disturbed. My hear about coming us together.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.680
Yes. And this, when you knew enough about Mama,

07:08.680 --> 07:10.680
even then did all of that.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.680
That this was disturbing news, didn't you?

07:12.680 --> 07:14.680
I was disturbing news.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.680
You also knew, Senator.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.680
The statement was a brand new,

07:19.680 --> 07:22.680
secretary of the army, didn't you?

07:22.680 --> 07:24.680
Well, he was familiar to me at one of the best.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.680
That's right.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.680
And you were pretty testified here that one of the very first acts

07:29.680 --> 07:33.680
that he did on taking office was to instigate a review

07:33.680 --> 07:38.680
or a review and a security situation throughout the army.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.680
No, I think everybody said that he asked the FBI to conduct an investigation.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.680
That was on April 10th, sir.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.680
Of course, it was completely unnecessary because they had sufficient information

07:46.680 --> 07:49.680
of which act, number one, number two, number two,

07:49.680 --> 07:53.680
it is the job of Army intelligence. They now have the information.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.680
Well, even if the FBI is aware,

07:55.680 --> 07:59.680
it was not until April 10th, the FBI, the FBI,

07:59.680 --> 08:01.680
in making investigations.

08:01.680 --> 08:02.680
You would call that test.

08:02.680 --> 08:03.680
I believe that it's not.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.680
Now, whether it's necessary or not,

08:05.680 --> 08:09.680
it's always a very wonderful idea if you're disturbed about security

08:09.680 --> 08:12.680
or safety to have the FBI go into the mask.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.680
I think that the following of the FBI and the FBI

08:15.680 --> 08:17.680
have sufficient information of which act.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.680
When you know it's right side, it's on the file.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.680
There's a great way of setting an effort.

08:22.680 --> 08:26.680
There was sufficient information in the files on April 10th.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.680
To suspend all those who are suspended after our hearings are called.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.680
Now, I am directing your attention to another patient evidence.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.680
And that is at almost instantly on taking off.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.680
Secretary Steven sent for the appropriate officers

08:41.680 --> 08:43.680
and had everything on the security situation

08:43.680 --> 08:46.680
so that he could be sure he could get the wheel going

08:46.680 --> 08:50.680
under his administration to do everything possible

08:50.680 --> 08:53.680
to protect the Army and the country in that area.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.680
Do you remember his phone test file?

08:55.680 --> 08:56.680
I don't recall.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.680
I'm going to get a test of many cases.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.680
I'll test them right now.

08:58.680 --> 09:03.680
Now, you go back to your work that served.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.680
You were, I think you were great with me.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.680
The moment you saw the truly quite a safe document,

09:08.680 --> 09:10.680
you were disturbed. Is that right?

09:10.680 --> 09:11.680
Yes, I say.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.680
All of the documents are here but try and find out.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.680
And you were disturbed with the safety of the country.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.680
Something else.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.680
You knew from the date on that document

09:20.680 --> 09:23.680
that it had been in the files of the Army for some time,

09:23.680 --> 09:24.680
did you know?

09:24.680 --> 09:25.680
That's very very impressive.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.680
And you certainly knew another person,

09:27.680 --> 09:30.680
so we have a record straight.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.680
We talked about that document.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.680
The document which I received, you understand,

09:34.680 --> 09:37.680
was a resume, a plan,

09:37.680 --> 09:41.680
according to the testimony here of an FBI report.

09:41.680 --> 09:45.680
Now, whether that resume was made and circulated,

09:45.680 --> 09:48.680
to verify if the documents are not,

09:48.680 --> 09:50.680
or whether the original documents are circulated,

09:50.680 --> 09:52.680
at this time I think they don't know.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
Now, you do, of course,

09:53.680 --> 09:56.680
that when Secretary Steven became Secretary of the Army,

09:56.680 --> 10:00.680
that he had a multitude of doings to perform, didn't you?

10:00.680 --> 10:01.680
Did you remember, did he?

10:01.680 --> 10:04.680
And you knew as someone familiar with Washington

10:04.680 --> 10:07.680
that it was just incredible that he would be able

10:07.680 --> 10:10.680
to locate himself with the file, quickly.

10:10.680 --> 10:15.680
He has a great number of men who are giving that document.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.680
The Secretary is the administrator in the office.

10:18.680 --> 10:19.680
He's got you, Senator.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.680
You're Senator.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.680
You're Senator as soon as you saw that document.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.680
And as soon as you were discovered by it,

10:25.680 --> 10:29.680
we're in a position whereby the use of the telephone alone,

10:29.680 --> 10:32.680
you could have said to Mr. Steven,

10:32.680 --> 10:35.680
Mr. Secretary, I don't know how busy you are, Domino.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.680
Or how much you've got to do.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.680
But I had some information about possible circumstances,

10:41.680 --> 10:43.680
so very soon to the Fourth Amendment,

10:43.680 --> 10:45.680
and I think you ought to have it.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.680
You could have done that.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.680
Couldn't you send it?

10:47.680 --> 10:48.680
I could have followed Secretary, Secretary.

10:48.680 --> 10:49.680
I could have followed it.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
Or you could have gone and seen.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.680
I could have gone and seen him.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.680
I could have followed him.

10:52.680 --> 10:53.680
Yes.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.680
And either one of those would have been a simple,

10:56.680 --> 10:58.680
courteous gesture on your file.

10:58.680 --> 10:59.680
Would it not?

10:59.680 --> 11:00.680
It would have been very, very simple,

11:00.680 --> 11:02.680
and a courteous gesture.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.680
For the case, the concern with the point is,

11:06.680 --> 11:10.680
after the information was given to the Secretary of the stratums,

11:10.680 --> 11:12.680
they took our hearing,

11:12.680 --> 11:14.680
they took public hearings,

11:14.680 --> 11:15.680
they get rid of these into that too.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.680
Oh, there were no secret caps from the Secretary.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.680
Mr. Adams is a lot of sit-in on every executive session.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.680
He was given all the information we had.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.680
It was only after hearing for help that the investigation started

11:30.680 --> 11:31.680
that there was suspension.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.680
One, I'm talking about April Armae.

11:33.680 --> 11:34.680
I know what you're saying.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.680
When you are disturbed,

11:35.680 --> 11:37.680
at the situation at Mama,

11:37.680 --> 11:39.680
you remember what I'm talking about.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.680
Do you know?

11:42.680 --> 11:44.680
April Armae.

11:44.680 --> 11:45.680
You don't know April Armae, go ahead.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.680
Yes.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.680
When you were disturbed.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.680
What happened to you?

11:48.680 --> 11:49.680
I'm not the situation at Mama.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.680
You've told me many other situations.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.680
Yes, but you're disturbed.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.680
That one.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
Thank you.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
You're a person of a bad life.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.680
Right.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.680
And I'm saying to you that it would have been a simple

11:57.680 --> 11:59.680
and let's say I think you're an ingestier.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.680
You say to this new Secretary of the Army,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.680
Mr. Secretary,

12:04.680 --> 12:06.680
there's something you've not enough you may not know about.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.680
It's got me disturbed and I crease you to know.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.680
You've heard of said that.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.680
Couldn't be the Secretary.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.680
I've got a talk to the Secretary.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.680
And we've put up in months, weeks and months ahead

12:16.680 --> 12:19.680
of the time that we were in the news.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.680
When this hearing comes about doing something about Mama.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
No.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.680
Don't you know it's going to carry that.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.680
It's the Secretary that maybe knows it.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.680
Let's just have to spike it out.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.680
No.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.680
If there's a Secretary of the Army, no.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.680
It's a security risk anywhere.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.680
That he can be put under surveillance for a moment.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.680
He knows it.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.680
Mr.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.680
Mr. Wilson.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.680
Mr. Wilson.

12:40.680 --> 12:41.680
That's the question.

12:41.680 --> 12:42.680
You know it's a Secretary of the Army.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.680
It's about any suspected surveillance.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.680
The Mama he knows he's made.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.680
What they're about to show her on your...

12:49.680 --> 12:52.680
The Fifth Amendment coming to throw.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.680
Was promoted.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.680
Given unable to judge.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.680
Fairfable.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.680
Twatch dizzy.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.680
We're been trying for months and months.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.680
Forgetting me such a thing, the name of those who responsible.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.680
I hope you'll let him get those names.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.680
Now, if you try to create the impression of all I have got to do

13:11.680 --> 13:14.680
is call up ahead of a bureau and tell him there's something wrong

13:14.680 --> 13:16.680
in his department.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.680
But it's not my tap.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.680
I do not give any secrets from the various departments.

13:22.680 --> 13:27.680
I have found over the past few years that a great waste of time

13:27.680 --> 13:32.680
to find a third house waiting up on my head to the various departments.

13:32.680 --> 13:38.680
But the only way that we can accomplish anything is by letting the American people know what's happening

13:38.680 --> 13:41.680
then we can force action.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.680
Now, as of this moment, keep in mind Mr. Welk.

13:44.680 --> 13:50.680
We are still trying to get the names of that old human loyalty board

13:50.680 --> 13:53.680
who sent men with terminus records.

13:53.680 --> 13:59.680
Men with them found on-sits to serve in the radar laboratories, sent them back to Fort Mama.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.680
Now, you're trying to create the impression I can really call up and say

14:02.680 --> 14:04.680
there's something wrong here.

14:04.680 --> 14:08.680
So, if I do a tentative, if you give the American people a five,

14:08.680 --> 14:11.680
I'm going to keep on doing that.

14:11.680 --> 14:16.680
Mr. Report, and would you be good enough to raise the tentative request

14:16.680 --> 14:20.680
and I just ask him and would you listen to what is its right?

14:20.680 --> 14:22.680
So, I always look to you as well.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.680
The file is ready for you.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.680
Would you listen to the question?

14:26.680 --> 14:30.680
Do you know that the secretary of the Army, for any suspected subversive under surveillance,

14:30.680 --> 14:33.680
the number he knows his name?

14:33.680 --> 14:35.680
In the near last question, Senator.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.680
I heard the question.

14:37.680 --> 14:44.680
Now, do you know that the secretary of the Army can put any suspect into the bird?

14:44.680 --> 14:48.680
Under surveillance, the law, he knows his name.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.680
She was a time spy, but I'm not sure.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.680
First, the women after they second they can put them on under surveillance.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.680
Get up to that surprise. That's the way up.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.680
I did hear this.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.680
The new question is whether or not the secretary can put them on under surveillance,

15:02.680 --> 15:04.680
I say the secretary would have answered the matter.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.680
Don't you?

15:05.680 --> 15:06.680
Go ahead.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.680
Um, five seconds.

15:08.680 --> 15:09.680
Five.

15:09.680 --> 15:14.680
Chair, a few questions would like to say that over the weekend,

15:14.680 --> 15:16.680
and during the two days of Mr. Kyle was testify,

15:16.680 --> 15:21.680
and the chair has gone through these various documents, specifications,

15:21.680 --> 15:24.680
charges, and counter charges, and statements to facts,

15:24.680 --> 15:28.680
and as much as the testimony that was previously given by Simon McCalfey

15:28.680 --> 15:32.680
as he could in an effort to find out, and to anew in the end,

15:32.680 --> 15:38.680
whether we had overlooked any pages of questions which should be cleaned up.

15:38.680 --> 15:43.680
And I'm aware of the fact that Senator McCalfey is going to follow his

15:43.680 --> 15:49.680
customer practice that he has followed, including the hearings of taking the so-called

15:49.680 --> 15:55.680
McCarthy, Carl Cohn, Dr. Minton, interrogate Senator McCalfey about that,

15:55.680 --> 15:57.680
as he is until again at the other witnesses.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.680
I have raised at least two points, possibly three or four points,

16:01.680 --> 16:06.680
so the other side of this specification signed by Joseph N. Wilk,

16:06.680 --> 16:11.680
on behalf of Adam's students, led it in for 13th.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.680
Do you have a copy of that before you and your other,

16:14.680 --> 16:15.680
or whether or not you have one?

16:15.680 --> 16:18.680
But you turn the page three.

16:18.680 --> 16:24.680
I believe that there is already testimony in the records about

16:24.680 --> 16:31.680
your answer to the child starting on the bottom of page two.

16:31.680 --> 16:37.680
Number of eight, in which it is alleged on the number six,

16:37.680 --> 16:41.680
that Cohn, McCarthy, and Carl, McCarthy, Mr. Cohn,

16:41.680 --> 16:42.680
and that's the car.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.680
Subtool of the range and assignment for a day in time,

16:45.680 --> 16:51.680
which will enable him to check on the textbooks at work point.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.680
Have you been asked question about that?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.680
I think that specific thing has been covered,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.680
but I am not sure I would like to head your testimony on.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.680
That has been covered, I would like to do it again,

16:59.680 --> 17:00.680
one of those.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.680
This is that piece of art.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.680
I will point to you, particularly.

17:02.680 --> 17:06.680
Well, now, I thought of the worst point phase of this,

17:06.680 --> 17:09.680
was the least important.

17:09.680 --> 17:16.680
We had information from clients that terminus-boying books

17:16.680 --> 17:18.680
for being used and doctorate,

17:18.680 --> 17:22.680
and the military, especially intelligence,

17:22.680 --> 17:25.680
and other vineyards in the Army War College.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.680
Some reports about the worst point of the life,

17:27.680 --> 17:28.680
I haven't seen very little,

17:28.680 --> 17:32.680
time for information regarding the worst point I must have met.

17:32.680 --> 17:37.680
The secretary discussed with me, I think, today,

17:37.680 --> 17:39.680
was the 14th of January,

17:39.680 --> 17:44.680
which is the day that he, before he went to the quarry,

17:44.680 --> 17:47.680
he came over to the car alarms with tell.

17:47.680 --> 17:52.680
We had a general discussion about what to be done about this subject,

17:52.680 --> 17:54.680
the difficulty of the committee,

17:54.680 --> 17:55.680
going into it,

17:55.680 --> 17:57.680
or they're not that well-wouldn't be a job,

17:57.680 --> 17:58.680
but we could do it himself.

17:58.680 --> 17:59.680
To shorten the...

17:59.680 --> 18:01.680
Then he just got signed, I have to connect to next.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.680
In the church testimony,

18:02.680 --> 18:06.680
the secretary Stevens brought up the matter of an assignment of sign,

18:06.680 --> 18:08.680
or the level to suggest and may have,

18:08.680 --> 18:11.680
the part of the three of you, the sign being assigned to him.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.680
The secretary of the Stephen's Grands Bay,

18:12.680 --> 18:13.680
that Mr. Cullen, Mr. Cullen,

18:13.680 --> 18:15.680
went up close by today.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.680
And I may have been able to turn them into...

18:17.680 --> 18:19.680
I believe we're talking about a different date than the MacKackie,

18:19.680 --> 18:22.680
just date, I think, is November...

18:22.680 --> 18:24.680
November 6th.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.680
So, November 6th?

18:26.680 --> 18:28.680
Assembly, I don't recall the justification number eight,

18:28.680 --> 18:30.680
and I'm not aware of any of the bottom seats.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
I was talking about the...

18:31.680 --> 18:33.680
You were talking about the Caroline's, the Federal League.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.680
I believe November was the luncheon in the office of Secretary Stevens.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.680
I recall a very little term of inflation,

18:39.680 --> 18:41.680
but what's the sign on that day?

18:41.680 --> 18:42.680
The...

18:43.680 --> 18:44.680
Me, to the Congressional,

18:44.680 --> 18:45.680
I think, that they had to do with...

18:45.680 --> 18:49.680
Well, they're not going to call off the hearings of the...

18:49.680 --> 18:51.680
Congressional, I think, no.

18:51.680 --> 18:52.680
What if this later?

18:52.680 --> 18:53.680
There's some confusion about the date,

18:53.680 --> 18:54.680
did it at any time?

18:54.680 --> 18:59.680
You or to hear now, Mr. Cullen, suggest and sign the...

18:59.680 --> 19:03.680
You need to be snowing very duty for purposes of making a study of...

19:03.680 --> 19:05.680
co-command textbooks in the art.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.680
No.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.680
No, but...

19:07.680 --> 19:09.680
And, Ferneth, Mr. Stevens, let me say that.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.680
Mr. Stevens and I discussed a number of occasions that I saw,

19:14.680 --> 19:20.680
but specifically the Caroline and the Federal, meaning the problem of...

19:20.680 --> 19:23.680
Communist textbooks,

19:23.680 --> 19:25.680
I mean, you're indoctrination,

19:25.680 --> 19:27.680
material and indoctrination for sports,

19:27.680 --> 19:29.680
stuff of the Army worked all day.

19:29.680 --> 19:34.680
And, oh, we discussed the wisdom of...

19:34.680 --> 19:37.680
I feel getting a team of competent people.

19:37.680 --> 19:38.680
Thank you.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.680
Do make a study of that subject,

19:43.680 --> 19:46.680
and see, until the fact,

19:46.680 --> 19:47.680
it would be very...

19:52.680 --> 19:54.680
Now, the way that he was discussed,

19:54.680 --> 19:56.680
was that your testimony that it was discussed,

19:56.680 --> 20:00.680
and the time and the item was initiated by Secretary Stevens,

20:00.680 --> 20:02.680
and there's no effort,

20:02.680 --> 20:03.680
it was made on your part to get signed,

20:03.680 --> 20:04.680
and sign that I just...

20:04.680 --> 20:06.680
No, no, no, no, that's the test.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.680
Now, I was at the background,

20:08.680 --> 20:10.680
and I was at the end of the study,

20:10.680 --> 20:11.680
last line of that child,

20:11.680 --> 20:13.680
if I look at the type of page three,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.680
because I think no question has been asked about this.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.680
And Mr. Wilson's specification is fair.

20:18.680 --> 20:23.680
These requests were coupled with promises reasonably to limit,

20:23.680 --> 20:25.680
or to terminate the subjectivity,

20:25.680 --> 20:26.680
hearing and whacknack.

20:26.680 --> 20:27.680
And I want to find out,

20:27.680 --> 20:32.680
what promises did you or Mr. Carl or Mr. Cohen make individually,

20:32.680 --> 20:33.680
or collectively, to limit,

20:33.680 --> 20:35.680
or terminate the subjectivity here?

20:35.680 --> 20:37.680
Mr. Chairman, there was never any promise made of any...

20:37.680 --> 20:39.680
there was never any promise made of any kind.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.680
We made it very clearly,

20:41.680 --> 20:43.680
Chairman, Mr. Adams,

20:43.680 --> 20:45.680
that Mr. Shiam had...

20:45.680 --> 20:48.680
nothing whatsoever to do,

20:48.680 --> 20:50.680
with calling his hearings on,

20:50.680 --> 20:51.680
calling them off.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.680
Mr. Shiam's induction in no way affects us.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.680
In one eye,

20:56.680 --> 20:59.680
the investigation has come to see him in the military.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.680
So, the year before the money,

21:01.680 --> 21:04.680
this statement in Mr. Wilson's specifications,

21:04.680 --> 21:06.680
these across the couple of his promises...

21:06.680 --> 21:10.680
reasonably to limit or to terminate some committee hearings on,

21:10.680 --> 21:12.680
thought man mounted and inaccurate statements.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.680
Completely false, Mr. Chairman.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.680
Both eyes to limitation of hearings,

21:16.680 --> 21:17.680
and as in termination of hearings.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.680
Completely false, and I might say, Mr. Chairman,

21:19.680 --> 21:22.680
I think very insulting to tonight,

21:22.680 --> 21:27.680
that, given my staff, when I would call off exposure of treasors,

21:27.680 --> 21:30.680
in order to get a favor for some five of meerkings.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.680
Number one, the hearing,

21:32.680 --> 21:33.680
we're never called off,

21:33.680 --> 21:35.680
until they file these charges.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.680
That result may have been called off.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.680
Number two,

21:38.680 --> 21:41.680
according to General Ryan, Shiam never got any favorites.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.680
For the best America election,

21:43.680 --> 21:45.680
there has been no questions about that particular sentence

21:45.680 --> 21:47.680
and the specifications.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.680
It seems to deal with the same general,

21:49.680 --> 21:51.680
and subject matter is the...

21:51.680 --> 21:53.680
press statement which has never issued from Fort Manman.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.680
But it refers to a different occasion.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.680
And you are quite sure that no such promise

21:58.680 --> 22:00.680
or an implication of promise is made.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.680
Very definitely, Mr. Chairman,

22:02.680 --> 22:03.680
and I...

22:03.680 --> 22:04.680
Thank you.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.680
Right now, Mr. Chair.

22:05.680 --> 22:10.680
Now to return to page four of the wealth specifications,

22:10.680 --> 22:12.680
item 14.

22:12.680 --> 22:15.680
There is this statement, the last statement in the paragraph.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.680
Private Cheyenne was absent from Fort Dick's,

22:18.680 --> 22:20.680
on such special persons.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.680
On occasions when, in fact,

22:22.680 --> 22:25.680
he did no work on behalf of this subcommittee.

22:25.680 --> 22:29.680
Is there testimony in the record?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.680
Is there information available for you?

22:31.680 --> 22:35.680
There is a proof that Mr. Shiam was absent on occasions

22:35.680 --> 22:37.680
when he did no work for this subcommittee.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.680
Mr. Chairman, this is just one of those statements

22:39.680 --> 22:41.680
which have fallen for lack of proof.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.680
There's been no proof on behalf of...

22:44.680 --> 22:46.680
You know, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Adams,

22:46.680 --> 22:48.680
Mr. Wells, that Mr. Chair.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.680
The Chair has looked through the record trying to find that.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.680
It's in the patent possible of course that Mr. Wells

22:53.680 --> 22:56.680
is in the question of his interlocutories.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.680
While he changed his own progress,

22:58.680 --> 23:00.680
may he introduce such evidence.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.680
But the Chair was concerned because he could not remember

23:03.680 --> 23:05.680
any specific testimony under oath,

23:05.680 --> 23:09.680
as to occasions when Private Cheyenne was absent

23:09.680 --> 23:11.680
on special passes,

23:11.680 --> 23:14.680
when it was true that he was not working on behalf of the subcommittee.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.680
And if there is such evidence available,

23:16.680 --> 23:18.680
I think he would be very pertinent to this case.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.680
At least it would be pertinent from the standpoint

23:20.680 --> 23:23.680
of whether or not the Army had been branding him preferential

23:23.680 --> 23:27.680
treatment or whether or not he had deceptively

23:28.680 --> 23:32.680
been able to get passives in order to de-seize the Army.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.680
And so there is evidence available,

23:34.680 --> 23:36.680
I think, that should be introduced during the question of hearing.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.680
No, I agree with the Chair.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.680
Senator McCartney, do you have ten minutes?

23:41.680 --> 23:46.680
Senator McCartney, during the course of these hearings,

23:46.680 --> 23:51.680
I have tried to be impartial and impartial in the performance

23:51.680 --> 23:53.680
of my duties.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.680
I hope I succeeded.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.680
And I shall continue to try to be a good girl.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.680
You made a statement while I was low that I have made some statement

24:02.680 --> 24:03.680
in a speech.

24:06.680 --> 24:09.680
About your being put in jail or being in battle,

24:09.680 --> 24:12.680
do you have any other instruments for that?

24:12.680 --> 24:15.680
Senator signing my first interview of Uplands.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.680
I have an interview with the record.

24:18.680 --> 24:22.680
In the record, I will sign up for the welcome.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.680
I will be back in a few minutes.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.680
Okay, here.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.680
539-15.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.680
Do you want to cut the left on it?

24:33.680 --> 24:34.680
I don't need it.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.680
I say, I'm just going to switch to Senator the other day and I think

24:37.680 --> 24:40.680
to stand the first year old's, but what or not I should give up the land

24:40.680 --> 24:43.680
of this young man who gave the dinner to me at the FBI files.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.680
Do you want to read a story of the paper about two or three days later?

24:46.680 --> 24:50.680
And again, I said, you know, hold your responsible points for news reports.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.680
This committee has enough information.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.680
Your statement has a report of what's with the effect.

24:56.680 --> 25:00.680
But you thought perhaps not only the man who gave me this information about tenure,

25:00.680 --> 25:04.680
but also Senator McTarty, nice big guilty of a crime.

25:04.680 --> 25:08.680
Senator McTarty, I repeat that statement, sir.

25:08.680 --> 25:14.680
I do not believe you can receive information that is obtained by a criminal medium

25:14.680 --> 25:19.680
and hold it in your possession without the probability of you two being guilty of a crime.

25:19.680 --> 25:23.680
Can I say, if anyone wants to indict me, they can go out a hat,

25:23.680 --> 25:26.680
son of a thorn, so this is a matter of legal opinion,

25:26.680 --> 25:30.680
but this is not for a strict information if you have a man for the committee.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.680
Senator, I ask you act like that.

25:33.680 --> 25:39.680
If anyone is reading that, we would understand that you had taken the position

25:39.680 --> 25:44.680
that I was number one, this information was obtained by criminal means, which is untrue.

25:44.680 --> 25:48.680
And number two, that I would give you the crime for having taken it.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.680
I feel that it is closely untrue, son of a thorn.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.680
I have hope.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.680
And do you know we worked together for a week?

25:57.680 --> 26:01.680
Well, for a week or a year, I have hope that you might correct that direction,

26:01.680 --> 26:06.680
because if it stands in effect for the first time under our beliefs, I think you agree with me.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.680
In effect for the first time that if today comes,

26:09.680 --> 26:13.680
let the Democrats take over the son of the thorn becomes the chairman.

26:13.680 --> 26:16.680
That's an important point.

26:16.680 --> 26:27.680
In effect, you say that no one can give me information about what I'm doing in government,

26:27.680 --> 26:32.680
because it is stamped with the stamp secret confidential restrict.

26:32.680 --> 26:41.680
Now, Senator, may I say, I think you are real slate, but honest slate, in error.

26:41.680 --> 26:48.680
If you are a right son of a thorn, that means that if I am in a job in the executive department,

26:48.680 --> 26:50.680
that's the entertainment department.

26:50.680 --> 26:56.680
If I am bezel, just the 100,000, half a million dollars, is my stamp all the documents,

26:56.680 --> 26:59.680
secret top secret confidential.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.680
It means no one can ever tell the Congress about that.

27:02.680 --> 27:07.680
And I think that the United should be on the same side of this slate, Senator.

27:07.680 --> 27:14.680
I think you and I should be on the side of attempting to give the American people all the information.

27:14.680 --> 27:21.680
So long as the dozen number one gives out the names of any informants,

27:21.680 --> 27:26.680
makes public any investigative technique, or no way in danger is the national security.

27:26.680 --> 27:33.680
But I'm sure Senator that you will agree with me that we've gone to a ridiculous point, both aside that.

27:33.680 --> 27:40.680
For the last number of years, in not worrying about the national security,

27:40.680 --> 27:44.680
but rather the information that might affect the security of some job board.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.680
And I say thank you directly to the right people that I made a speech.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.680
And you want to know what I have in it?

27:51.680 --> 27:54.680
Senator, I ask you about the speech that you have defeated.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.680
I said your statement.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.680
I want you to reflect through in the speech.

27:57.680 --> 27:58.680
I said your statement has it as code.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.680
Isn't that what you are saying?

28:00.680 --> 28:01.680
I have yet to know.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.680
I'll ask you about the speech.
