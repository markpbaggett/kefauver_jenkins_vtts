00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I thought I was just like a speaker.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
You're a statement.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
You're trying to say the case speeches about wanting to get this thing over.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
If you like to look for the speaker, you're scared.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
And I hope that the time comes when we get the bias and the legislative plans.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
But what this problem is, so that we can go out there together.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
I just feel that my system is still a little bit silly.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Hope we can work it out.

00:26.000 --> 00:37.000
So, do you challenge my position when I ask for a room in the room to get tired and let you not see your colleagues on this committee who seems to touch that document?

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
In apprehension, that they will be doing something here, we do, and all.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Did you not look this way, rather, with the seat?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I think that's a great statement.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
That is, not the best push to pursue.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
To try to look at the questions resolved through legal and proper processes.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
So, for some of you who are right, thank you.

01:02.000 --> 01:16.000
But what was me say to, I feel, I think everyone was watching you felt, that you were indicating that you felt it was wrong for an investigating committee to get any information as a stand by the way.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
If you were, if that was incorrect, I think that you should correct the record now, Senator.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Because this can have a very serious flexibility for an ability to get information.

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
I won't think I am wrong. I want to say that I take the position that the father who takes the document is committing a fail or violating the law.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
When I doubt that anyone is authorized to receive it, and I think that should be fair enough, as you indicate it, I think, there is perfectly so a moment ago.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
You may not always reach out to the committee, and if not wrong to know that I'm proceeding easily, then they're receiving such information.

01:57.000 --> 02:07.000
If you miss all of that, as a position I have taken, and I thank you for, may they choose just this before I move or someone, I don't know who, as being a stack of dick.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
I don't know what a stack for no other could be. We should get it unstacked. I can put a hand on the frame.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
And get right here. Would you pass it back?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You don't have to pass it back.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
Even if the position is pressed, all I want to do is establish it as a fact so we can all proceed according to the law.

02:25.000 --> 02:33.000
If your position is incorrect, and the law should be what you intend it is, then you're the considerumending the law.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Are enacting a statute that will not be received your legal?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
That's all I'm trying to do, Senator.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
I thank you for you, Mr. Senator.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
The minutes are so long and clear.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
Back in 1912, I was a handful, pretty much the only order but we have to beg.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
And at that time, my fellow professor, Senator Bob O'Fall, has seen you.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
He produced a bill that was passed as far as I know a civil war today.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
It provides that every individual in civil service has the right to give to finish,

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
quote, information either out of Congress or any committee or members of the law.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
And that's right, you're not getting it very good.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
Now, that is not a list. That's not a list. That's not a list of me, legal information.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
That wasn't, that wasn't, that wasn't good.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
That's someone taking a class as a five-dog, and then I think it can be the wrong person.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
I don't think that any government employee can deny the people they write to know the fact that I'm using a law for some amplacian.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm not saying something.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
The question is a legal question.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I don't think that's the truth about some sort of animal.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't think that's the truth.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
That's all I'm trying to do.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
But as long as the government is better than the government, in the hope that you will write about your administration

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
that is restraining you and that we can get away from all of us.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
And get down to the procedure that we all recognize and acknowledge as being the law of the land.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
So I was very affluent to recognize all your colleagues here in the two-step and the council

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
that this committee had selected in these decisions, which is just the document.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
And I think it's very new on the road as to how we were proceeding when we were in the law about the law of the young and about.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
And I think it's very important that I do whatever I can be certain that's all I'm interested in.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
It's not something to me, I think it's very clear, so there's no question about it.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
So I got to see who tries to sustain me or vice versa.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
My life is in the end of the committee.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
I will receive all the information I can get about wrong during the executive branch.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I will give that information to the American people.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I understand that you have a mission.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
And it will give, I will protect anyone who gives me that information.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, I don't bring it that's protected and it will give you information.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
That is not the question of the mission.

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
The question is, will you use all information and the curing of information that may constitute or need to be given to the government of it?

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
And I think that is the issue that I want, sort of, because I...

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
When the Democrats get here, I will proceed within the law.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
So I can answer, probably, as far as it is, if you're a long time to debate this, you can still have Democrats get in.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
But I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Before I send a direction, I know that the person that begins to question that.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
You didn't want to answer that, did you?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
That was a mistake.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
Just chairman, I nearly want to make one observation on the general question of the informants.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
It involves it once a legal question and a moral question.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And I don't believe government can be on both sides.

05:44.000 --> 05:55.000
Now it runs in my mind that in 1852, Congress passed the law, which is setting effect on any citizen of the country.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
If you were to form on somebody who has, say you would to pay attention.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Or on a hundred methods.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Or there will be a rule in the form of a 20% of the recovery.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
If memory serves me correctly, the informer statue to the true sign that I am making is still on the statue to us.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
And as a matter of fact, it was modified somewhat by Congress a few years ago.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
Now, if government says to its people through the funders now it will inform on your fellow citizens,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
you will receive a question of whatever you can.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
There is a moral abstract in the matter.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm just wondering where you place the divide as well.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And it gets not an easy question there.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, I may say something about it.

06:42.000 --> 06:52.000
If you have fellow law, who have some books to me in the years providing that we give a bonus to individuals

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
who give information about financial wrongdoing.

06:57.000 --> 07:06.000
It is completely incomprehensible to say, but you must keep information about the prison secrets you can't give that to the country.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
It works, and it's probably, I just want to raise this one question.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm pressing out.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
There is a law.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm frankly disturbed as you are about this thing.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
But I protested just over the court here since it might be so.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
I have the utmost personality that has been barged in those throughout the same new agit.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I just want to get a question so there is other.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
If we call it as an narrative, that would be a bad fallout.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
I think that can be an information through a thought solution.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
It's a question that is much of no easy solution.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean, my approach at legalistically is to try to look on outside.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
But I'm wondering about it this idea.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
It's like a suit, a document in a file of which two men had a knowledge.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
If it's telling the end to the end, it could be resolved and giving aid and comfort to the end, which is the extra definition for truth.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Suppose one of the truth should say, I want to get a friend who would translate this to the end of it,

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
and the other would not assume of his interview to be sent to it, and then went to complain to a superior who will about it,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
and got to know such a fact the end state.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
And then, all into the attention of some of the other half to some.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Now, a legal involved of where you saw the line where the security of the country could last,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
and it might be a pretty easy solution.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Sure, there is one of the two individuals,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
there is an ingrained sense of lawyer's vision, the lawyer's vision,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
and the lawyer's vision says, this is the case.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
If you give it, and while I get no conflict with my superior by telling him,

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
but you have this in mind, I'll call up one of the scientists and tell him about it.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Question is, what about the legal aspects, but what about the moral aspects of the conflict?

08:42.000 --> 08:53.000
I think it raised a problem in front of the point, so all it doesn't require any answer of any kind.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
I personally feel that the oaths that every individual takes the time,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
this country is all enemies for and the message,

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
places upon him the heavy responsibility to bring to the Congress any information,

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
a wrongdoing for the matter of not being taken care of properly by his superior.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Take the Harry Dixon White Chase, for example,

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
if someone in the executive department had come to the Congress of that time,

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
given the information which we got, after Harry Dixon White was dead,

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
it might have meant to many men who are dead today would still be living.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
We know now we had a tough time despite the Treasury Department working money system in China,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
planning our occupations in Europe.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
So I may say, Senator, I feel a strong way that this isn't even a close question.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
I think that oaths to defend your country against all enemies for and the message,

09:53.000 --> 10:01.000
powers above and beyond any loyalty you might have to the head of the Bureau of the Head of the Department.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kennedy, I'm still in trouble about the list of employees of the committee.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
So Colonel Murray, I've been informed that Senator McCarthy wishes to see the list

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
before it's committed to the Pentagon.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
No, is that correct? Could it be that?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Senator, I have a question.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Mr. Kennedy, could I have a visitor to the list?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
A recess, two minutes.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Here he is for about, not over five minutes.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
I think that it is a matter of public record.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
The list of employees on every committee, I think, says that.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
I believe the law requires that they'll be public for beginning each year in the conventional record.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And a list of all people out available for the record.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
No, no, no.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
There's no point in anyone taking vital time in the committee on this.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Of course, the names are going to be supplied.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
May the people of the committee be sent to the committee to talk to you.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
You have just heard that Chairman Month declared a three-thirds answer.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
The ABC Television Network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army controversy.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
The ABC Television Network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army controversy.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Senator McCarthy is returning to the witness chair.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
He is on his left, Mr. Frank Carr and his right, Mr. Cohn, as you see it on your screen.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
He will be elected behind in a large parking space, containing the records and the notes of this hearing.

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
And the regimes to the Anacines be in charge of those notes and material and need passeth into the senator to Mr. Cohn and Carr if they are needed.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm on the recess.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
The introduction has just concluded his ten minutes go around.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
The next committee member in order is Senator Jackson.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Mr. Chairman, I think it's a hand for the two-minute recess.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I was called back to my office over the question, but I'm not...

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Mr. Walsh, anyway, I'll start the names of the staff members.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
They can have their names of all staff members.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
It's almost new mail. I would like to check over the list and make sure that you have all those who are working with the staff.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
And if you want those, it would want to be all right, so throw them out.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
The staff members are public.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
No reason why anyone should have their complete list.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
And it's one of the last ones published in there.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
That's correct.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
I think that is in January that we're not here today.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
The staff members are public.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
No reason why anyone should have their complete list.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I'll give one a call.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
I'll give one a call.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I'll give one list.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
If you will, Mr. Walsh, and one to seven times in a minute, then we'll have everybody in position of the faculty.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
The staff members, you have ten minutes.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I'll pass.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I'll ask them questions.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I'll ask them questions.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I'll ask them questions.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
You have ten minutes.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I ask your question.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And if your question is my memory is all yours.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I'd like to ask a question again.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
If you are a person who authorized to receive this document under the law, there is no violation of the law.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
If you are not authorized to receive the document, there is a violation.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
If you're simple as that, it does not appreciate it, just in no answer if you can give one.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Nothing is wrong with that, sir.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
Now, I understand you believe that it's permanent chairman of the staff committee on investigation.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
You are an authorized person to receive classified documents, is that right?

13:40.000 --> 13:48.000
I'm an authorized person to receive information in regard to any wrongdoing and executive branch.

13:48.000 --> 14:00.000
And when you say classified documents with the timing, then certainly I am not authorized to receive anything which would devolve the names of, I will say, informants of Army intelligence.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
I mean, which would, or anyway, compromise and investigate a technique.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Not sort of thing.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
But as chairman of this watch star committee, I think that's what's in the following.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
I see why I'm in duty to understand any inflatable or ongoing.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Well, now let's take a typical illustration.

14:21.000 --> 14:28.000
I agree with Senator Jackson's settlement, this is a fundamental proposition and it may be the one good thing has come out of it, hearing too quick and analyzed.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
I believe it's probably the main in this government, to those who most of that security matters might possibly be the executive secretary of the National Security Council.

14:36.000 --> 14:57.000
Now, most of the second secretary of the National Security Council decide that he has some information which he thinks is a derogatory and he believes that somebody on the National Security Council say the director of mobilization is doing something which is against the best interest of the country.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
And does he have the right to give you a classified document, I think?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Well, look, there's something in your mind.

15:04.000 --> 15:15.000
The number of assumptions in my question of which I didn't agree, I think the land in the west and more prominently qualified.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
There are many questions security and I don't like to write these quote tales also.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
I know he showed me a lot of them, getting rid of a sore over the past 32 days.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And that's the exact correct.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
As far as the National Security Council is concerned, the executive secretary.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
The executive secretary, Mr. Bundae.

15:34.000 --> 15:46.000
Why isn't it the chairman? Mr. newcomer, I believe as he lives on working with that individual. Mr. Bundae, as you very well know, Senator, has...

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
I don't know anything about the funding of the UN.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Well, we discussed it in a regular session with you.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Well, let me make another illustration.

15:57.000 --> 16:07.000
Suppose that the deputy director of the CIA believes that he has information to show that the director of the CIA is functioning against the security of the United States.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
The deputy director reporting for the director.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
So he has the right to bring a classified paper down here to you as chairman of this committee.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
Well, first, Mr. Femme, you must not worry too much about the paper, but rather the information.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
The deputy director of the CIA, or anyone else, has information that anyone is guilty of wrongdoing.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
Then he should bring that information to the representatives of the people.

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
Namely, yourself, some demand, any of us, for my money, is quite bad. I'm not sure if it should bring it.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
To my number, that's fair, because they say that they will explore these names.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Well, that's Kevin.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm quite a person, forbidden.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Then you're allowed out of my question.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Senator, you haven't heard this Democrat say anything exposed to any name.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I do know that.

16:55.000 --> 17:03.000
Senator, if you just heard the unwritten, I can't go through the testimony now, but I will be glad to see the opening of the afternoon.

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
The question is, what kind of a view, but you would give the names of any of your informants.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I thought that was an unwise decision.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Well, I am. That was your offer, and I did that picture down at the rest of it.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I told you I could get asked.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
You've been John Harnett, told you that anyone else has never made an statement.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
And the chair said he believes that Senator Miss Smith has made this today.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
And today, he did not say for giving out the names of the public.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Senator, I'm not going to know what I want.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I didn't want you to know.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
Senator, if Senator Fallon can read the read, I think this would be a great benefit right now.

17:35.000 --> 17:42.000
Because, as you know, as a Mayor, we've got 47 Republicans and 48 Democrats wanting to fund them.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
We don't know who will be the chairman of this community after the first of the year.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
If the Democrats...

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
If the Democrats...

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Now, you may not be...

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
No, no, no, no.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
This is not a big, kind of question.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Why is this not a big question?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Could we, could we now...

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
You and I are both set of the public.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
You will either be the chairman of the right and the Democratic member.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I will either be the chairman of the right and the Republican member.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Can we now say to the public...

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Say to the people working in government.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
But if they know of any wrongdoing,

18:08.000 --> 18:19.000
that no pony stamp of secrecy or classification should keep that from the Congress.

18:19.000 --> 18:27.000
Can we agree now, John, that if anyone brings you in information or any information,

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
if they do that in a confidential manner, that their names will not be...

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
If we do that, we do that.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I'll do any more information very frankly, if they do it legally.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
No, their names will not be given out.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I will not protect people in crime.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Now, I have to defend, and that's the issue I'm trying to get settled.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
But if you want to take the other position, that's your privilege.

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
That I say frankly, that I will not protect people in crime against my government.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
In some summer, after giving information, I don't want to put a position you took with respect to...

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
The one who gave you the document that you thought was legal and you had a right to it.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
I would certainly agree with you that you were under no obligation whatsoever to give his name.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
That position I take, but I will back to the position and the path of all.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But I will not come bold.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Fine.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
So, in some time, I don't know what your position is.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
In some way, don't we do this?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
And I don't want to pursue this.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
And I think whether we're all right enough to do anything.

19:26.000 --> 19:37.000
Can we agree that if anyone in government knows any wrongdoing, whether it's left, or it's treason, or it's come that's in so fresh.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.000
But if they come to you, if they come to me, that we will consider that they are doing their duty,

19:45.000 --> 19:53.000
and that they are not guilty of any crime, because the law says they have the right to do it, they take an oath of law to protect this nation.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
If we get a green map, some say it's an operation.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
If we have some say it may have been a green map.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
Then I think that much of the time which might otherwise be considered wasted would not be wasted.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
I say that you would answer the bad if one brings to me a classified document.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
And I am with the opinion of the US Biologist of the Law, then I will be under no obligation to keep those names secret.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
And until you can settle that question, I cannot swallow.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
I guess I'm going to have to go to the other side of this year.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
Mr. Chairman, Chair believes now that one of the final persons will settle the cause of any crime clearance, certainly sending the McCarthy head.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
I just want to say that one of the final persons will settle that.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Make it very pretty, Chair.

20:32.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't think there's anything in the record on the part of any of us on the Democratic side that we would not accept information of wrongdoing from individuals in the government.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
The FBI operates on the premise that it must get information from people.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
But that is one thing to talk about a employee coming up to the hill and say so and so maybe violating the law

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
is doing things that are wrong and report to a privilege, report for a member of Congress's privilege.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
I think every citizen has an obligation to report violations of law.

21:04.000 --> 21:12.000
But this is one senator who wants to make it clear that a employee is a government and a citizen has no right to violate the law

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
to report a violation.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
They can come up and say so and so is a crook down in a government yodel look into it.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
But that doesn't give the citizen the right to take classified secret documents.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
Up to the hill, in violation of the statute of Congress, there's a vast difference.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
I don't believe the FBI has people in the law and violate the law in order to give them information.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
Now all of us want employees all citizens to report to them violations of federal law or Congress has jurisdiction.

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
And I don't want the record to stand that at least I, as one member of this committee,

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
I'm not interested in getting information of wrongdoing.

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
That's one thing but to ask an employee to commit a wrong in order to report a wrongdoing is something else.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
But this I don't think you like.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
This is the generally I assume that's the nature of a person I've known.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Some of Jackson makes a very unusual statement here.

22:11.000 --> 22:20.000
He tells that it will be a violation of the law using the certain circumstances of a report to wrongdoing.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
Now that's not the right senator.

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
Whenever there's any wrongdoing in draft corruption, racism,

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
the person who reports that to the Congress cannot be guilty of any wrongdoing.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
And when I say that I just, when I have 30 seconds of Mr. Chairman,

22:43.000 --> 22:50.000
I, if everything is possible, as a chair, and I'll try and get my demo, that thing, come back on the committee.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
I felt that the work of some important we should have on here.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
I've all of that the highest respect for the Summars of Mark and Saul.

23:01.000 --> 23:08.000
I just wonder now whether it is wise, mean, and follow the best word of it,

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
and where I'm modifying it, and effect subtle employees,

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
that they should not give us evidence of wrongdoing.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
And some of the jacks, I'm going to take that.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
You are, whether you're bitter or not, senator.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Anyone that you've got to give it a good jury here on the television audience?

23:25.000 --> 23:34.000
I think any man that has two and two assume that you are saying that if someone brings you evidence of wrongdoing,

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
so that is improper if he may be violating an order of his department here.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Take take for example, some of the signs.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
I think you and I should be at the beginning of the reading,

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
we read him the work of the other day.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
It's new secrecy rules, and a part of that's the way.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
The secrecy rules became effective, I believe, in April this year.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
The right of the fair, where they couldn't stand something secret under any presidential record.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
They could stand before official use only.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
A rather fantastic document.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
I think that we can gain something here, if all of the centers could agree.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
We got to put it, we got to democrat our republican party in the White House.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
And the time may even come, we have a democrat, I hope not.

24:22.000 --> 24:34.000
But we do not have any secrecy rules that prevent a federal employee from giving members of Congress and the wrongdoing.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
If we could agree on that, we would have accomplished something.

24:36.000 --> 24:46.000
So, let me FPI as a top secret document, carrying it up to a number of Congress on the Hill and the Fiance of an order of J. Edgar Hoover and during the right thing.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
It could give me a long doing within the federal government.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I don't know if anyone who is in the federal government.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
I didn't ask that question, I said supposing.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
I said supposing a clerk in the FBI.

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
As in, here's her custody, top secret material and the specificity of the law and the property of wrongdoing and not handling it properly.

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
If we're perfectly all right for that, we're going to bring it up to any member of Congress and chairman of the committee in the Fiance of an order of J. Hoover.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Number one, you are assuming a metric of Hoover.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
We would try to protect wrongdoers, may it be I have wronged?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
That's what we're talking about yet.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
No, that's wrong. Mr. Hoover would not.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
I think the best of them for the implementation.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
The ones where it's not there next year.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
He can't be there for every month or year.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Your question is if someone knows the example, let's make a specific comment.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
If someone knows, I'll be in the press for a moment.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
If someone knows the example, I'll be going to the press.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
My name is...

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Chair agrees with that.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
I was in a press conference.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I'm going to send a Jackson by the way until he's next door.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm going to send him a guy to the press and discuss with him.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
That's right.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I'll be in the press.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I'll be in the press.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I'm waiting.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
We've been waiting.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
The other two representatives are state of their positions.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I'd like to say bye.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
All the government agencies, executive branch and are ran.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
My office was always open.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Do any differences in any person before?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
The day has something that was so far.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
It's not doing right or they were getting a fair deal.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I would say that at least 90% of the cases

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
there's a investigation, a misunderstanding.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
The following that would either come to me with this problem

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
or something that he always entirely wrong.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
As to the other things I'd say I also believe crime is wrong.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
And I'll believe in a government.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I'll believe it.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Just a unanimous man.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Just a unanimous man.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
That's right.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
I'll believe crime is wrong.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I believe the government is wrong.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Now may I continue with it, Christy?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Because I understand kind of going back to life

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
and you believe that it's permanent chairman of the Subcommittee on investigation.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
You are an authorized person to receive classified documents.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Did that right?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
First of all, some of the...

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
I assume you may have that comment that you may have wanted to comment on.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I would say when you admit that the phone's open,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
the crime is wrong, but I agree with you.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Now, number two.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
There's one thing that's not getting any.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
And remember, it was deep enough about a document,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
but what about a letter?

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
So there's a letter of water waiting for us in place.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
That the summary is surely added.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And I'm going to have a few questions.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
As I understand some of you are going back to the last one.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Do you believe that chairman of the Subcommittee on investigation?

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
You are an authorized person to receive classified documents.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
The answer letter is...

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
What's the timing from that?
