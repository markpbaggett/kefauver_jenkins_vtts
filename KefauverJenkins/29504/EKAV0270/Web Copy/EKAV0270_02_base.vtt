WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I said the answer to that is that no one can deny our information.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
And now they've got information that's not going to pass the fire.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
So they've got it to run a top-shake with you there at the secret.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
But it's not going to pass the tram on them.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
We should not, we'll see, give information that's given the land for any of the once-runny

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
investigation agencies.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Anything that's there that is going through there and investigate a technique.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
I think which might endanger the national security.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
We have not.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
I believe that other members of this subcommittee are also entitled to receive such documents.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Not those who say that they will make public names of the informants.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, I would be glad to make public names of the informants.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
That's not all.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
I would be glad to make public names of the informants.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
But if it's a violation of law, I think I'd have the right.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I would say that it's going to make public the name of a informant.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
So some of it could be agreed that there's no law.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I think I'd have the obligation to make the name.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Sorry, but we agreed that there's no law, which allows the man to suffer a wrongdoing.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
They're the only law in the book.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
As far as I know, covering this subject is the law of making 12 of which says that

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
the individuals in the executive have the right to do to get information from under the comments.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, Senator, of course, I wouldn't want to get a name of an informant.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
If he was legally right for him to give me the information, as far as the law of 1912,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I was not just saying that he sent over here.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
It has nothing whatever to do with satisfying information.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Now, let me ask another question.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Do you believe that the chairman of any other Senate committee,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
say the Senate committee on internal security, is also an authorized person

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
for the purpose of receiving such confidence and documents?

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
Any committee with those jurisdictions over a subject has authorized receiving information

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
when he sent them from the documents.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I would say does not control it.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Any any any any of them's wrongdoing should they be being available to people,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
especially when it has to do with prison?

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
We don't have a sub-inspirational security or anybody can decide themselves.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
We don't have the classification of a document if they believe that it's wrong,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
whatever there's a failure does, and therefore they have to write,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
to tell us who has the right to committee, is that right?

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Some of this will be no question, and there's any anyone who has any wrongdoing

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
has any right to the duty to bring that evidence to a congressional committee.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Now, I'll do it this year, you can follow Jerry Ryan, a reading center.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
I will do it this year, but not the end of the day.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'll do it this year, because the information about himself,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
so I think we've got to have to take that.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
And that's not the end of the day.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Now let me ask you this question.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Suppose there was something that a person felt was wrong,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
it turned out not to be wrong, then what would happen?

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Suppose that a man came to you in from an agency that I had information to show

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
that my boss on the chips of staff is a traitor,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
or it's done something which I think is inimical,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
but with the best interest in the United States,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
and it turned out to be fully wrong.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
What is the procedure from there on?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Do we investigate and check whether the man is right or not?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
And what do we do about that?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Do we turn it over to the FBI?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I think the center here is fully aware of the clear rule.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
And that is that the name no one accused of wrongdoing is made public.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And so number one, you appear before the committee

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
and as well as the chief finalist and number two,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
and to all of the suspicion voucher and the convention committee

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
is wrongdoing.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
And so, the question is,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Mr. Wilson, please invite your head to the committee.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Senator, I don't know that I can throw any light on this.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Rest all of these.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Some of your time with you.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
But as I, my north raises followers,

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
that it is your testimony that no one can think I asked them by that,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I take a community committee,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
information by stamping a document classified or confidential,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
as that's your opposition, sir.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
No information of any wrongdoing.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
That's right.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
So that if the FBI has a report about some wrongdoing and has

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
with some malty to stamp it,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
classified or confidential,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
it may still be brought to you by some disabled government employees.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Is that right or wrong, sir?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
No, number one, just so there's no...

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
That's there's only one answer today.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Is that right or wrong?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Well, I'll answer it, but I...

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I'll think it's a answer.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Number one, we received no information from the FBI.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Number two, I do think Mr. Boston will ask me for the information.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
I think number two, if the FBI has an issuing reports to certain agencies,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
because I'm Mr. Eckers, he is a stripper.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
If you'll be as firing as the North on Avenue,

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
if someone on that agency knows not the reports are being ignored,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I think he has a duty to bring that to the U.S.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
So this committee, the dinner committee, the Vellic committee,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
something to clear for you, sir.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
That's what I thought you meant, sir.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I think we understand each other.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
And as far as you are concerned,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
the appearance on the top of the document of the word,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
is it classified or confidential?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Just don't impress you.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Is that right, sir?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Not if not if that's the prosecution's cover for ongoing your business.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
And if it's put on by the FBI, it does not impress you.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
I know we're providing a hoover's cocktail here on the heavily-bred stood.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
As far as I'm concerned, I never have received any information directly from the FBI.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Not directly, sir, but it gets different from one of the other.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And if the one that's the patient that's arrived, I will still.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
But you are quite ready to take its second hair, not, sir.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
I heard you've told me things were so excellent, matter of fact.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I didn't think that that said.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
I know you didn't, sir.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
You know, I agree on the importance of it.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Now, my name is the FBI.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
It's only a few questions.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
In the FBI, as in the ultimate stage, as reported,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
evidence of prison-ready partner,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
in the hell of a department who was all over them,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
in the reviews of full action on them,

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
then I think it's a duty of any amount of people

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
who love this country to bring that to the attention

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
of the proper investigating committee.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And I think that is the rule that we should solve,

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
not only in 1964, but in 1964, 1974, 1984.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Otherwise, what's about?

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
If we can cover up, long doing,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
if we can cover up, say, then by a sample, say,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
then you and I, you and I will...

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Like I said, the administration certainly wanted to on the way.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Well, Senator, let's try one more time,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
and then let's be done with it.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I take it, sir, one more time.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
One more question for me, you.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Now, I take it, and it is your position,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
that when the disgruntled employee,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
who sees before in this document,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
stops, fails,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
classifies, or is confidential,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
emanating from the FBI,

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
and is satisfied with the progress that is being made about it,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
in the end, anytime,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
with the pride, deliver to you,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
can you tell me whether that's correct or not?

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
You're in front of anything, your question, Mr. Unchrooze.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
You talk about a disgruntled employee.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Is that definitely...

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I got this question in order to argue employee, right?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Mr. Wells, your current cancer question from the man

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
will bring to the Congress information sendient.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
The one in the organization, look, they finished it.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Well, according to your definition,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
the young man who came to the center of work

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
and gave him information,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
including in the safety part,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
the truth of all your hits.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
The exact young man has followed

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
what apparently is your rule of conduct,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
then all your hits would undoubtedly,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
as of this moment,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
as of the 16th day of June, 1954,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
you don't know the whole of your mind position with government.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Now, that's your definition of disgruntled.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
A young man, a young man who gives evidence of truth.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Who would have reflected all the defendants of your hits,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
all enemies warning domestic?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
You and I have a much different definition of disgruntled.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Then to my faculty,

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
I am not trying to settle the question we have under discussion.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I am trying to only through a little bit,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
so that the country will know what we are talking about.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Do you understand that, sir?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I understand exactly what you're trying to do.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
This is what I am trying to do,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
and you can help me,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
and we be done with it.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I want more, I want to help you,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
and what you're trying to do.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
One more effort.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And then I must let it go,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
and I must trust you to answer me simply and directly,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
so that the country will know what you're saying.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I take it as clear that it is your relationship, sir,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
that is the FBI,

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
issues today,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
and document my confidence,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
and some government employees have,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
and conclude that things are not ruling strictly enough.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
That government employees may with the fire

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
and bring the documents to you.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
No.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
You're answering no.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
You may not.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Answer me, sir.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
No.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
The way that you put the trust in answer is no.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Now, Mr.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I am going to ask you to answer me.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I am going to ask you to answer me.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I am going to ask you to answer me.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I am going to ask you to answer me.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
No, Mr.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Senator McCarthy,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I was determined to fight a different matter.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Let me have a second.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
No.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
I am looking at page 6247 of the record.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It will be a very short reference,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
if you say anything,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
and you would want to talk to life as it's real.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Hello.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
What day is that?

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
That is volume 31,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
cancer June,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
page 6247.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
You have just one month left.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
page 247.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
I am looking at you,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
and I am looking at the top,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
almost the top of the page.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
This college graduate,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
referring to Shine,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
partially filled out an application,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
leaving out substantial parts of it,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
as though it were unimportant.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And that the General of the Army had to call him up and get him back

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
and have him come back over there to later days,

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
and really fill out his other applicants have to fill out an application,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
a form for information on the Army.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
That is the matter.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I might as well think about the application you build out.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Mr. Jenkins, you don't know one thing about that.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Senator Maccati,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I never saw it.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Senator, I have the application that seems to shine filled out,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
and I can tell you that I'm here in order.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm sorry?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
If I don't tell you, I'm in order.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
No, you may have any time.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh, sorry.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
That's a little weird.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
What's it?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Maccati, you're welcome.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Yes, sir.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
What's your prefer, Senator?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
The copy that has your original signature.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Or would you be content for the photos, sir?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I will send you a word for it.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
If you say that I know that I have an assignment,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I will send you a word for it.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And may I say to you, Senator, that I don't think it's a devil

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
saying to have this turned out.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But it happens to be an accurate when you say

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
you didn't know anything about it.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
You did sign it.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And I'm going to ask you to look at it since I want to ask

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
the question to you about it.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Let me, let me, let me.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I still say that I don't do anything about it.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I don't recall everything seen it.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I am showing you.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
If you can't find it, I'm sure that's it.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I'm sure that it is.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I'm showing you a certified copy.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
And if you look at the clip on the last two or three pages,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
and open them one of the clips scattered together,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
you will ask them to see your signature.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I want to make a sure that it's a motorized above

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
the even for nothing.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Oh, it wasn't auto-ranged by you.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
That's it.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Well, the road motor has a lot of efficiency.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
You know, let's put the page to go to the...

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
The clip's there.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
The clip is on the page that has your signature.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
The clip's toward the bottom.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
You'll see.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
It's there. All right.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
It's your signature.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
It's there.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Now I want you to turn to the first page of it,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
if you will.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Where Mr. Shine states his qualifications,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
you'll serve a block of high-priving,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
out of the world for time and fire.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I suggest you, in the next 10 minutes,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
they go to all of the event that's alive in the hearing,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
for some time, and they get to it.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn will give it there.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
No, no.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Mr. Cohn will give you 10 minutes, Mr. Cohn.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Well, sir, that's available.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Who will leave now, Mr. Cohn?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh, Mr. Cohn will give it there.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Mr. Cohn will give you 10 minutes, Mr. Cohn.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
That's available.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I think only one question.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
And it goes to this discussion of which we have had a great deal this morning,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
which I think is very helpful and very constructive.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
And now here is the dual responsibility

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
and the co-ordinate system of government of the executive branch

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
and of the legislative branch, which I protect the interests of the people.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
We are all in happier people all around the table,

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
that we have in the FBR, and I think I have no who.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
The world's best security organization.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Not only from the standpoint of protecting the safety of this country against aggression,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
but from the standpoint of protecting this all against crime.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
It's your last point, all however,

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
that conceivably eight times had come when just to mention the letter, just the art.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It might not surround them with the help,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
which were rightfully surround those letters today.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
And he calls for the attention of Senator McCarthy who was not in Congress at the time.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
But about eight or ten years ago, when the new deal was at its peak,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
a deliberate effort was then made to get to the government.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
So I happen to be a member of the House of that time,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
and I wanted you and I to pay tribute to a great Democrat from Bob.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Hey, I'm Patriot, and you isn't the House.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
The majority leader of the House of Representatives is that same John McCormack,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
to whom I went personally.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
I mentioned the information I had about the government on the part of some politicians in government.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
They'll get rid of Jay at the Hoover.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
And the record will show that John McCormack went to that for Jay at the Hoover,

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
both within his council's own party and public.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
And his officer will think him with a man who would have done a politician

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
instead of a grand security officer dying to interact.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I mentioned that only for this week,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
that all of us should keep in mind that there could come some unhappy day.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
When Jay at the Hoover, who is more than like the rest of it,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
is not fair.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
Although he might be replaced by some politicians from political preference,

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
an un-developed representative that is entirely conceivable to the Church,

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
that if the FBI seeks to be a grand organization to protect us against this loyalty

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
and protect us against dishonesty and against danger,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
and that's another information, and can be used for political purpose.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
We must not let the idea get abroad that such an FBI,

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
so much money, then so much use, should then have the right to stand on its own elections,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
shift and classify, and deny that the people's representatives in Congress

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
are right to expose such a sad situation.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
Now I think we all know that that day is not here and it is not near.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
And I hope it never comes.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
But I hope once the record just stands unforeseen,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
that this committee believes that it is individual-tenant of the means

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
that we're establishing a formula with that.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
If the FBI can be captured by those who are in the show, I know it.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
We have a region that's meant that the formula is to do it.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
It's the sense that the documents classified and then no number of Congress,

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
no congressional committee shall have any right whatsoever to protect the public.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
The hypothetical situation, I think it should be understood,

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
because in the chair's personal knowledge will be a template that was made some years ago.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
That was not a question, it did not require an answer, but I'm a copy.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I'll send him a comment, you have to send it.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
I don't want to make this comment on what this thing is telling us first.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
If we're in touch with the documents that try to first have them,

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
I believe the law should provide that we can get them by surprise.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Maybe I'm wrong about that.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
But I think the audience, the audience, the talks are such as a government.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Should they be it?

17:04.000 --> 17:10.000
And not the individual conscience of the individuals.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
So if it is right, just to have them, I'm not saying it isn't.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
I can rather appreciate that, Jesus, that could develop conditions.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
So that would be such corruption, such traitors and the executive plan to the government.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
I hope you're not inclined by a such and there now.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
But if there's left hand should come.

17:34.000 --> 17:42.000
I think the Congress should have the power and safehold by a proper enactment of law.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
That is the position I take.

17:44.000 --> 17:58.000
I simply believe in law a governance by law and not governance by the conscience of individuals who's conscience, often paid.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
That is not a safe.

18:00.000 --> 18:09.000
I think all the security of this country must be chairman I shall now proceed with the other question.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I guess I can, then.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
Senator, let's go back to the document if they may please.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
I call your attention, just pass that file.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
They treat the first seven to five other three,

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
meeting from the Army Center for the Foreign Affairs.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I am reading from the air document.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
As further evidence.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Just a short sentence.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
As further evidence with the dishonest state,

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
all the attacks that the mass staff issues through Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Pater.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Three of them have been left, copy I have.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Just a second.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Yes, I know.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm calling your attention to the work dishonest state.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Yes, sir.

19:07.000 --> 19:16.000
They do have that time feel and will you now feel that the child is against your staff as you replicate in this language?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Well, they dishonest the fact.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Different.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Do you say that time, like some of the charges against Mr. Carr, you know,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
have an answer if you know anything like my foot.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Well, that's not the time.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm talking about the charges.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You think they will dishonest?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yes, sir.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Now I call your attention, and I call the three of them.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
They won't work here in order.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I said, issue the truth and Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Yes, sir.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And that is the truth.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
In that instance, then you just claim that you are charging Mr. Stevens.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
So, second, I'll be in the Mr. Adams with dishonest state.

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
Mr. McCullough, I don't know who thought of this, sir.

20:00.000 --> 20:07.000
That's much better than Mr. Lee because of the work that some people justify and the other persons work.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
And the car will often focus on any of the pieces he wants to move through.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
Now, I stand at page four, paragraph six.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
Now, read the last sentence in paragraph six.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Then, please, in proper perspective,

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
it will be found to have given greater aid and comfort to commoners

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
and security risk by any single other obstacle ever designed.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Now, I think that we're first to, if you agree with me, de-report,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
which is in location in the center of the bar, then that we're first to,

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
with chronological, the document of chronological events, so it's not.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Yes, sir.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You're going to answer whatever that I agree with it.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
One of the men said that, sir.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
I think there are other things that I've given much more comfort to the community.

21:10.000 --> 21:19.000
I think, for example, the situation distorts by our committee from the Center for Markham's Office on the Committee to ensure the threat of China.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
I think that's the final important lot we can make.

21:24.000 --> 21:32.000
I think that a number of other things might have given greater aid and comfort.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
This is the language of the report I have.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm saying that's an exaggeration in your charge.

21:39.000 --> 21:48.000
I wasn't saying exaggeration, but I think if you refer to the aid and comfort to commoners in government in this country,

21:48.000 --> 21:59.000
then if you refer to aid and comfort to communism of the whole,

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
I'm sure there's another situation that I'm giving more aid.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
Well, there's some greater or less or not.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
I think this has been a great service for becoming a partner.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
For four months or thereabouts, we've not been able to proceed with our work of taking up the crundits.

22:20.000 --> 22:31.000
We have exposed those in self-places in the department of the Army who are protecting those who are protecting those who have infiltrated into the government.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
Are we winning some discomfort to the commoners?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I'm concerned with this.

22:39.000 --> 22:46.000
I didn't want to get into this, but I got to be frank about these answers.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
I was watching myself from my family, great deal with respect.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
I was always happy.

22:53.000 --> 23:01.000
I feel that he is what you refer to when you call a good Democrat.

23:01.000 --> 23:08.000
However, I find that, to my side, I've been not so recommending too highly this time, but I'm a Democrat.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
I find the most important part of the summer of March and fall.

23:12.000 --> 23:21.000
I was visited by the chief council of the Army five days before he came back on the committee.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
I find that my Democrat friends came back on the committee and the Reno V. Backwards gave them every consideration that they asked for.

23:28.000 --> 23:37.000
I find that since that time, we've been doing practically nothing except spending the time, the money, the efforts of the committee.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
In investigating charges which have all of us now, Dr. Lee, I have completely without foundation.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
You mean the charges you've made over that foundation?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
No, I'm referring to the charges against my own.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I may have been interrogating you.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
Mr. Smith, Mr. Solomon, I made an answer to the charges of the man.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
We did not make charges, we answered them.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
For some reason, I believe as a lawyer, he knows that when somebody comes in a court, you make charges.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
The man against whom the charges are made makes an answer.

24:05.000 --> 24:15.000
Now I've been by this answer completely and as I say, I am disturbed by many aspects of this case.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
We don't know about that point.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
We don't know this point, Senator.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
What part of some assignment is lawyers or in the office is not even mind out on you?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Well, we can get to that and that's just there if you do are.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
If the state would take the slam, we should press right now.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
You know the bank is on the top right, Mr. Smith.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
That's the moment.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Good boy.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
And the McComb has a part.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
Now you say it, Senator, that your document is only an answer.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
If one has made a charge against you and M. Tann, then you're an answer.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
You say he's alive, don't you regard that as a charge against him?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Just answer.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
And that said, improve our embrace of charge.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
That will you allow your answer, and answer my throw and break the counter charge.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
The counter claims to allow.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
All right.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Last and sorry for you, Mr. Commander, charge is in.

25:13.000 --> 25:22.000
In this counter charge years, that's this action, this station, this document has given great aid in comfort to the commoners and security of this.

25:23.000 --> 25:33.000
For many singular jobs, political design, you are used now state that that action is the act of a patriotic army of the people of the government.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Patriotic army, yes, use the mind that you have used.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
I don't want the development of the mind of the private students, I think,

25:44.000 --> 25:54.000
what he did was grossly improper, what influence was the word and just can do this, I don't know.

25:54.000 --> 26:01.000
We learn as we go through these hearings that two days before they see them that on the side of the moon,

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
that even the sub-demon of the Sun is one of these long-haired phones, so he doesn't affect there's really nothing to do.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
I understand that.

26:10.000 --> 26:22.000
I think it was highly improper of making up to think about that as highly improper to finally use fraudulent dishonest charges.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
Now, I agree with you and I think it goes both ways.

26:25.000 --> 26:33.000
If there's honest sergeants, highly improper, I think it's most referenceable on either side.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I hope you agree with me.

26:35.000 --> 26:43.000
I think the soldiers just point out where, at any point in our answer, we thought that anything goes up to proven literature.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
And it's not entirely the same as how 30-moving research ends up in the true course.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Thank you.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Isn't that a picture of this old model?
