WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I believe I've already done that.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
For it's run me to do it again, I'll be glad to.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
I will ask you to.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Sure.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Sure.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Turn your hands, and just with the weather's changing,

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
then, the title of the number and the number and the number of feet.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
The record will not be written by the text of all numbers,

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
that direction will come.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
There are no letters, there are no letters.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
I know the title of the number and the number and the number and the number of warnings

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
on the show.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Whatever the file is,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
it's fully attended.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
That was the chair of the committee.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
You want me to go over the table by paper?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Just a note, just a minute.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
The first document is a...

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
I suppose I put the number one on it.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
It is a graph of the one of the points of America internally.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Reports.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
The second...

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
...and this...

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
...it is part of the first report.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
It's time to cut.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
To get the record straight.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
I have no desire to have all these documents printed in the case.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm not sure, but I did have in mind,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
and I said that it's...

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
...you understand,

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
that they will be filed as exhibits to show that Mrs. Pesky and the hand

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
have come to the committee for a paper.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Whatever the...

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
...that's also a...

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
...possibly just a million.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I'd have had a flat.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
The second, which is a type in...

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
...type either with green ink or a draft...

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
...of the record on information centers.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
The third is a draft of the report on...

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
...a title-faker, West Faker East.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
It's actually a report on the engineering projects of the Voice of America,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
which was prepared by the research director of the committee,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
in which was rejected by Senator McCawdell,

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
and subsequently re-done and substantial thought by Mr. Shine.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
The fourth thing here is a plot of a...

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
...one of the final drafts of the annual report of the Subcommittee...

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
...worked over by Mr. Shine,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
end of December, beginning of January.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Well, then, a fix and very note made by him.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
The yellow papers at the end of the folder are...

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
...an outline of the report on the information program...

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
...and my writing, which was prepared by Mr. Shine and myself.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
In addition to this, Mr. Florida, I...

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
...disgrace to the faculty subcommittee.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
There are other matters prepared by Mr. Shine, dealing with...

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
...and others on the basis of information from Mr. Shine,

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
dealing with confidential informants and information obtained from that.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And there is a witness list,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
like the eyes prepared by him, which has not been supplied.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Senator, would you please leave that on the air?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yes, sir.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
One or two questions.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes, sir.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
Mr. Coleman was quite the shiny, quite time employee of the Subcommittee.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Yes, sir. When he came with the Subcommittee,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
it was on a part-time basis all while they were afraid at the time...

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
...when he gave more than full time.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
And what?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
How old you used to be?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Who was that?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
No.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
I had some of my special effects.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Did anyone else assume the beauty of the key?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
It was done as best in the list.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Consumption?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I think it remained as present in General Manager,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
but I think other people in this organization did assume...

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
...the various responsibilities which he could not tell,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
because at the time he was giving to the Subcommittee.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
At the time, he was conducted in the Army,

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
wasn't still performing in the list concerned about what he was supposed to be.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I suppose I was.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
You're on your way.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
You may have never had an understanding of human feelings out there.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I'll give you.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I'll give you.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Give him so you can look him into.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I really don't know, Mr. Coleman.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I told me so at the time, I don't care if I didn't give much time.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Did you tell us the purpose of this date?

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm with the time he delivered to a private business.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
When the unit you had to know them were three...

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
...was 1953, five months ago.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You have no idea?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I don't have any accurate ideas.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
That's all I know.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm a Smith Army knee-pickage, I can't.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Unless the colonel, I have the entire file,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
but only a vehicle, sure, you have just a number five.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
That's the last time I get here.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
And these are the documents that you have submitted to the committee.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
As the work of private China and Mr. Shion,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
from Hogan, the third, until he terminated the services with the committee.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
No, sir, not exactly.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
The main thing would be printed three interim reports

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
in certain sections of the annual report to the board.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
No, sir, but he wrote the part to the report.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, these are parts of that report.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Yes, I think we did not keep the drafts in the post-end,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
but both lose the product with those words.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
That is a very small part of the product.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
All right.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
This is yours.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
So now, my machine and I made up together,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
is in my right hand.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
And you, right?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yes, sir.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
So I've said from that, the rest of the day,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
through Dr. Mr. Cohen, Mr. Shion,

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
please pardon me.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
No, get out of here.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
No, sir, it's not Senator.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
So who gave this to Mr. Shion?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
There's one, as I indicated a few minutes ago,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Senator McClellan, there was one draft in there

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
of the Baker East people, which was prepared by Mr. Carl Foss,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
by Mr. Foss, by Mr. Foss.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
He told by Senator Melda,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm going to get out of there and get Dr. Shion,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
and then I'll get the rest of the day, Mr. Shion.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Uh-huh.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I think you have, as far as from that party,

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
I have too much data.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I have too much.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yes, sir.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I'm going to take out, sir.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
All right.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
No, I don't have it about that.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm afraid you've picked out the wrong things.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
No, I don't think I have the right thing if you let me do it.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
It starts with a Baker West.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
No, Baker West Baker East.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
On that part.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Baker West, maybe, sir.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
And take that out.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes, sir.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
This is the product of this work.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yes, he did those things.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
You have in your hand, I believe.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
That's the product of these words from us.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Yes, that's a small part.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yes.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Who doesn't take that, please?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
The farmie just, the these days, they do?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
No, one day with the green fighting, I understand.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
He did one with the green fighting?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yes, sir.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
And these days, they did that.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Yes, I think that was probably actually a six-day fight.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And the last part of that fight,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
he just considered it as a substance, a pill up here,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
a fascist, and that's right.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
No, sir.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Not actually.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
But I think the annual report, as I outlined,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
when I testified the last time, certain sections of product

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
were essentially written by him before they were miniagrept.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
However, as this, the product of all of the farm,

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
that he was all of the sellable use about,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
no, sir, as the product of a very small part,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
although the rest of the main product, sir,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
is in the actual three-interim reports and styles.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
The world of that, sir.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I could write both from Mr. Walsh,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
and I think I filed a set with some committee.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Mr. Walsh, you live with you one day in the evening.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yes, sir.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I'm really, really sure that this is a little too much.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I have what I can find in the building, sir.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
What I'm trying to do there.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
That's what I'm asking.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm trying to find out some of that,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and then try to get so we'll see if there is a product of his role.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yes, sir.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Did you take the report that was filed in the file?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
A substantial part of it was written in the day.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Sir, the center of right point, the last time I testified,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
a substantial part of it was written by him in this way.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
It was not dictated to a sonargo for he wrote out in one key.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Where is Muth?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Sir, where is Muth?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
We didn't keep it. We didn't keep mine.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I see you kept yours here.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
No, sir, I didn't actually close.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Who's the new one?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
That is a part of an outline.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Otherwise, we likewise found some of his notes on that January 2nd draft.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
But basically, sir, we did not keep any of the drafts of the report.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Why did he keep your notes and not keep theirs?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
He's a consultant now.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You don't have to answer now, do you?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
The pure option is that we kept any of these.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
You're an accountant.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Yes, sir.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
May be.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
So you asked me how.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Now, if you got anything else in the file, let's give him all the gears.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
Go to the show, the justification for all of these fees to get him off,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
so that's the committee.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Sir, is there anything else you can offer?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Sir, we're not that many.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Please, an arrangement was made, and he wrote,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
well, whatever, there were.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
You know, already tested for that two years,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
it's time to do all of the files of them.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
He wrote the financial part of the report, sir, and as I said,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
we did not keep drafts of the report.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
You wrote them in long years, and you didn't say you were here with somebody else.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, don't have it to show it.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
No, what happened to this, sir?

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
He wrote the good part of it as long as over a weekend.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
I frequently would just work all of it as long as we're sometimes

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I retighted and might type out of a home.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Hello, I have a fountain.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Let all of the proof mail ask off on it.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I mean, sir, is that all of the proof?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Yes, I have all the proofs on the reports that you have there.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Plus, the file which I outlined.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
That's what you're stating.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
No, sir, I believe that they will stay with us,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
and some information from confidential informants,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
which is just way too many counsels, but not often.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Hello, I want to have a question, Mr. Pohn,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
say that on the phone, if this is all you want to say about the first file.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
You know, I didn't think you had to want to add for it,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I didn't want to talk about it.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Now, anything else you need?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You told all you want to about it?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yes.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Just one of the stuff, you know, thank this in fairness to you,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
and other for us, Robbys.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
It was best of five years that I believe in this, rather than...

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Well, Mr. Susan, I don't want to miss a bit either,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
but I'm sure one of them.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Something about you having the capacity to control this committee.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
You have a comment on that.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
The income can, that you have, it's a capacity.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Are the inflores to control this committee?

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
So I haven't come in for that, because I think the state in itself is too ridiculous,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
because there are any comments.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
You think that's ridiculous, that you make choices, right, Mr. Pohn?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
When you acknowledge you do not have a capacity to decide,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
so it means no sense.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
All right, that includes me now.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I will move a committee back in those days.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
You want an honest answer, and I'll do well.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I want to get... I didn't want any implication here.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
There.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
That's some of us will be in the unfold.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Sir, I thank you so much, Robbys.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Yes, sir. You are now in the committee.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
If you were, I'm sure I could have had no capacity whatsoever.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I will not try.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I'll call.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
And the sender is my radio and the question is Mr. Pohn.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
And the sender is from my left.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
There are any questions that you can't.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I'll take them.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Say them one.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Well, I mean, if you have this time,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
we'll go back to the concord with Mr. Pohn.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
If you have a question, I will not.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
I use the title here.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Very well.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Send them a copy.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
You have any questions, Mr. Pohn?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
No, I just did a comment about it.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Pohn.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm sorry.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I think the meeting has been hosting the senders.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Concentrate with me at the last.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
So, yeah, I do.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I believe that's the all-way practice and show.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I would like to have some of the chair that's not asking the death

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
might be useful.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I would like to have a comment.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
I would like to ask, thank you.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Thank you, sir.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
You're the practice.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yes, now finished.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
The practice is about the examination.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
All the centers that have been available

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
are available to the public.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Pohn.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I don't know if you're going to have any questions.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I don't know if Mr. Pohn, you have any thing you yourself would

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
get an ad here at testimony.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
So, I think this is a plan to...

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yes, sir.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
I know the all-way practice.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
There is one thing I wanted.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
There is one short statement I did want to make.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
And I told that to send it a month this morning and ask his commission to do it.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
And I'd like to do it now.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm going to make it very content with that.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
You can do it.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Right?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Yes, sir.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I'll make it the same.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I'll make it the same.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I'll make it the same.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I'll make it the same.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I hope I'll be under the same minute, though.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
Mr. Chairman, some things have been said yesterday afternoon.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
And at other times, during these hearings, about the staff of the Stutt Committee and about the conditions of its files.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I don't know much about the conditions of its file, right?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Have never gone through the files.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But I know a lot about the staff.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Most of the people on the staff perform it up behind, man.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Well-trained.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
No matter where they came from, I do know this.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
They have all in their very small group.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Done a job which is this outstanding.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Based on those, I think, the most active year in the history of the Stutt Committee.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
There have been 95 days of executive hearings.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
There have been 331 witnesses examined in executive hearings.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
75 days of public sessions.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
215 witnesses examined in public sessions.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
I have here, sir, and I might later ask permission to file out the Stutt Committee.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
A rather, what I think is a rather impressive look of comments who have been exposed and thrust out of government,

13:06.000 --> 13:13.000
out of the government printing office, out of the army, out of schools, out of colleges, and out of defense industries.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
Due to the work of this handful of men down on the spread.

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
The last word I want to say about them is that they have worked day and night and weekend Saturday Sunday, Sunday nights.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Without any overtime, without any enforcement.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
For one reason, because they believe in a cause.

13:34.000 --> 13:47.000
The cause is the protection against this nature of this nation, against communist infiltration, which is brought about the downfall of so many other countries throughout the world.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
And the concluding part of what I want to say before I leave the stand is about two people.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
The pool might have been closely associated in this cause during the last year.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
And those people are Frank Cox and Senator Joe McFarland.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
As far as Frank Cox concerned, his record has been well stated here.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
He came to this committee.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
The might be for he came. He was the head, the supervisor of over 200 of the top FBI agents in this country.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
He produced, with them, the evidence which put in jail.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
The first string and the second string leaders of the communist conspiracy in this nation.

14:23.000 --> 14:33.000
He has been made to sit here for some two months now on the basis of completely unspantic and unsubstantiated charges against him.

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
And my final word, sir, and one which I must make before I leave the stand, is about a man who, to me, is a great American.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
And that is Senator Joe McFarland.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
I did not know Senator McFarland before I came with this committee.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
I live a different religion. I am a different political part of it.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
From both him and Mr. Cox.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
In the year, we have worked together.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
There has never been any distinction because of religion, political affiliations, or anything else.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
I have never known a man who has less unkindness, less lack of charge.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
In his heart and soul, then Senator McFarland, and I have never known a man who has been loyal and devoted.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
That is, there and to everybody associated with him in this course, Senator McFarland.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
I have seen him sit here for over two months now, virtually as a defendant.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I have seen him wait in the Senate for all the unity.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I have seen him examine and close the family.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
On the witness stand.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I have seen him work day and night.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
On other things, all of that time.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
And I have seen the businessman, that he is right.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
To those near and dear to him and to those near and dear to Mr. Cox.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
I think they have been badly treated and having to sit here.

15:51.000 --> 16:01.000
When their only crime has been that of doing their levels back to protect this nation against the menace of communist infiltration.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
I think that they have been fairly treated in sitting here.

16:05.000 --> 16:15.000
But I think that they reward, comes in what I know as the gratitude of the American people, the two men who have given so much.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
They keep this nation safe against communist infiltration.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Thank you, I was.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Senator McFarland, I just want to ask you one question about your health fee.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
That's all right.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And I want to ask you one question in your face.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
When you say somebody thinned most fee, if you don't win by this committee.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
No, the committee is not responsible for these charges and counter-charges.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I do not have any ideas that are in the world.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
I do not have any ideas, I mean by members of this committee and their questions are in anything else.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
I mean in sitting here on two days before the whole thing started.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
The man who brought the charges there, they are closely exaggerated and there is nothing to them.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
That's what I have to take you to the world.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
Mr. Alchemy, is there any questions?

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Send a direction or send a sign with an intervention?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Then it's voice-like any questions?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I'll be ahead and you have a question to chair.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Mr. Witness, we'll start in the morning.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Mr. Jones, the car is here. Understand that.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Kind of.

17:18.000 --> 17:27.000
So, concluded the 34th day of the games, looking into the dispute between Senator McFarland and the high officials of the Army.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Mr. Francis Sire, completed his protest in any.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
A latest afternoon, Roy Cohn took over the position as witness.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I'm beginning now at Donald Trump.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Senator McFarland will be in the witness chair.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
At Donald Trump, Eastern Goat, I've timed.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Now, no, no.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Do not television networks, department of views, and public affairs.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
The Residents' coverage of the Senate, permanent subcommittee on investigations, games, and ration from DC.
