WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Yes sir.

00:01.000 --> 00:14.620
And I, if I ask you anything, if you think is unfair or the two think is wrong, will you

00:14.620 --> 00:15.620
tell me?

00:15.620 --> 00:16.620
Yes sir.

00:16.620 --> 00:21.400
You feel that I have asked you anything that was wrong or unfair?

00:21.400 --> 00:24.900
Well sir, I didn't like your statement.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.700
I don't think you asked me any questions or nothing.

00:27.700 --> 00:28.700
About the file.

00:28.700 --> 00:29.700
Yes sir.

00:29.700 --> 00:36.020
Now you say you made it very, I say to you, you made it very clear that if, say you're

00:36.020 --> 00:41.940
secretary or somebody else's secretary went down and the file clerk wasn't there or was

00:41.940 --> 00:42.940
ill that day.

00:42.940 --> 00:45.140
It didn't happen to be there.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.540
She could go ahead and get the file.

00:47.540 --> 00:48.540
Right?

00:48.540 --> 00:49.540
And what's the rest?

00:49.540 --> 00:51.740
And your answer is she could do that, yes.

00:51.740 --> 00:56.380
And then I say so in effect the files are available to every member of the committee

00:56.380 --> 00:59.980
on the certain circumstances and you say that is correct.

00:59.980 --> 01:00.980
Yes sir.

01:00.980 --> 01:05.820
And then I say do you know what's clear and each of your staff members has?

01:05.820 --> 01:10.700
That is each investigator keeps clericals, the naga for file work and so forth, right?

01:10.700 --> 01:11.700
Yes sir.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.700
And you say yes sir.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.700
Right.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.700
And then I say what are those clearances?

01:16.700 --> 01:17.700
Let me put it to you this way.

01:17.700 --> 01:21.700
Have they all got clearances from the Department of Defense?

01:21.700 --> 01:23.700
And if so on what basis?

01:24.420 --> 01:28.300
You say they have clearances varying degrees of clearances.

01:28.300 --> 01:33.140
One of them has top secret clearance on a need to know basis which has never been retracted.

01:33.140 --> 01:36.900
Generally they all have clearances up to and including secrets.

01:36.900 --> 01:37.900
Right?

01:37.900 --> 01:38.900
Yes.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.900
And then I say let's say you say one staff member has top secret clearance.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.900
Oh yes sir.

01:44.900 --> 01:49.220
And then you say I was told that one staff member was given top secret clearance.

01:49.220 --> 01:52.220
I don't know that it was ever rescinded.

01:52.220 --> 01:53.220
Right?

01:53.620 --> 01:57.620
And then I say all the others from the Department of Defense have secret clearance.

01:57.620 --> 01:58.620
Third through secret.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.620
Third through secret is that right?

02:00.620 --> 02:01.620
Yes sir.

02:01.620 --> 02:04.620
And you say the other person is through secret yet.

02:04.620 --> 02:07.620
And then I say it on all or two of this.

02:07.620 --> 02:13.620
And it really would not make any difference whether one had top secret and all the rest had secret.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.620
Or one had secret and all the rest had top secret.

02:16.620 --> 02:19.620
Then they all had access to the file.

02:19.620 --> 02:20.620
Isn't that right?

02:20.620 --> 02:21.620
Yes sir.

02:21.620 --> 02:27.020
And usually I would say that it wouldn't make a great deal of difference whether it was secret or top secret.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.020
No sir that's correct.

02:28.020 --> 02:29.020
Yes sir.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.020
Now.

02:35.020 --> 02:40.020
Oh I haven't got this morning testimony but as I understood this testimony that you gained this morning.

02:40.020 --> 02:47.020
That's why that all information with respect to parenthesis that you had an executive director of the staff.

02:47.020 --> 02:49.820
You will see from Santa MacArthur is that correct?

02:49.820 --> 02:50.820
I think that's correct.

02:51.220 --> 02:52.420
I'm sorry I haven't got it.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.420
Anybody got the morning testimony here?

02:55.420 --> 02:56.420
Jim and you guys?

02:58.020 --> 02:59.020
I think it's one.

02:59.020 --> 03:01.020
I think I can find it if you have a copy.

03:11.020 --> 03:13.020
Now if I may read it one day six seven oh one.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.020
That I'm a copy.

03:16.020 --> 03:18.620
Mr. Car I think yesterday you mentioned.

03:18.620 --> 03:22.020
Then we received F.V.I. report to Casey.

03:22.020 --> 03:28.020
From the answer I got about that there might have been a ceiling that you had received the F.V.I. report.

03:28.020 --> 03:30.220
Then he F.V.I. report from directly to me.

03:30.220 --> 03:31.820
Is that right?

03:31.820 --> 03:33.020
I read that correctly.

03:33.020 --> 03:35.220
And you say yes it's right.

03:35.220 --> 03:39.620
And then tell him the copy says in any case secret top secret confidential.

03:39.620 --> 03:44.020
When come to you and you would only learn about that by hearing about it from me.

03:44.020 --> 03:45.020
Is that right?

03:45.020 --> 03:47.020
And you say yes sir that is right.

03:47.220 --> 03:48.220
Have I read that correctly?

03:48.220 --> 03:49.220
Yes sir.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.220
Now my last question.

03:52.220 --> 03:59.220
On the question of who has parents from the Army or the Department of Defense on your staff.

04:00.220 --> 04:04.220
Does that also come from Senator Barney in addition to F.V.I. clearance?

04:04.220 --> 04:05.220
No.

04:06.820 --> 04:11.220
I think that some of the letters from the Army come directly to me.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.820
I said that I thought you would say yes.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.820
I think that I think that I can say yes.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.420
I have to check that.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.420
That's my last question.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.420
I wanted you to recollect that.

04:19.420 --> 04:20.420
That's what I can do.

04:20.420 --> 04:25.220
But at least some of the letters may come to me from the Army to the First of all.

04:25.220 --> 04:27.220
Some of the letters may come to you.

04:27.220 --> 04:28.220
Yes.

04:28.220 --> 04:35.020
Well with respect to those staff members who have parents from the Department of Defense.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.020
Right.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.020
Thank you.

04:37.020 --> 04:41.220
When you be good enough to send them anywhere to put in a record.

04:41.220 --> 04:43.620
I told them it's a challenge to be the way to do it.

04:43.620 --> 04:46.220
To one that has the rest of you know about.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.220
Yes sir.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.220
Father Smith.

04:49.220 --> 04:50.220
Thank you.

04:50.220 --> 04:52.220
How many of you think you can do that?

04:52.220 --> 04:56.220
Who one do you want it?

04:56.220 --> 04:58.220
Should we have it by today tomorrow and then?

04:58.220 --> 05:00.220
I think that's all right together.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.220
I'm sure.

05:01.220 --> 05:02.220
Thank you very much.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.220
Any other questions from the Secretary?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.220
Mr. Conn, I think I should.

05:05.220 --> 05:07.220
Mr. Chairman.

05:07.220 --> 05:11.420
I think that's what I'm going to tell you is the point of information that's under time and mass.

05:11.420 --> 05:16.620
But how are any information coming from the FBI?

05:16.620 --> 05:25.620
I come as a personal confidential letter before I get to make a request.

05:25.620 --> 05:34.620
I recognize on the basis of testimony that you gave yesterday.

05:34.620 --> 05:37.620
I was not talking about the FBI files.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.420
I made a letter to talk about them.

05:39.420 --> 05:41.620
I might ask you what your position is on them.

05:41.620 --> 05:46.620
What I was talking about, Mr. Conn, what I was trying to find is the statement of yesterday that you made

05:46.620 --> 05:48.620
really FBI files.

05:48.620 --> 05:51.620
So I'm going to talk about the defense and any other agencies.

05:51.620 --> 05:56.620
We do this under some of the information that will be available.

05:56.620 --> 06:01.620
I would like to make sure it doesn't request a lie.

06:01.620 --> 06:07.620
And we'll take that up for the U of the U of the U term before we speak tomorrow morning.

06:07.620 --> 06:12.420
I think that you are too angry in any way to get the information whenever it's in the world.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.420
I'm sure you're together.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.420
Thank you.

06:15.420 --> 06:18.420
And I'll tell you that I got the information out.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.620
I'm trying to look at one very great but,

06:20.620 --> 06:28.620
matter of course, Mr. Turner, Mr. Walsh has been referring to a memorandum.

06:28.620 --> 06:35.620
I, uh, nobody was in any circumstances.

06:35.620 --> 06:40.420
I'm attempting to see that jury.

06:40.420 --> 06:44.420
But from the present last meeting, the parts of the memorandum out,

06:44.420 --> 06:48.420
it's not as possible that those listening might wonder about this memorandum of the bus.

06:48.420 --> 06:50.020
I'm going to read it to you.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.220
And if I don't read the structure,

06:51.220 --> 06:54.420
would you tell me this is the memorandum of December 21,

06:54.420 --> 06:58.820
18, 153, that's the one that Mr. Walsh was trusting you on.

06:58.820 --> 07:03.820
Two circumstances from Frank's car following my conversations on last Thursday in New York.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.620
Frank's had not passed the subject meeting.

07:06.620 --> 07:09.620
I've not told the one day of Steyne's time or service.

07:09.620 --> 07:13.620
Except the necessary for the committee work.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.020
We stopped there and said,

07:15.020 --> 07:19.220
I have to, you know, this was my request.

07:19.220 --> 07:24.020
If you make sure that there was no interference with Mr. Shines.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.020
Uh, Shines of rights.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.020
Yes.

07:26.020 --> 07:28.020
In continuing as you know,

07:28.020 --> 07:30.820
he left the committee about our subject in the beginning of this portion,

07:30.820 --> 07:33.420
the investigation, he had on a great deal of work

07:33.420 --> 07:37.020
on that from his defense establishment, the state involving Jeanne.

07:37.020 --> 07:41.020
I agree that contact to him to be kept at the minimum

07:41.020 --> 07:44.220
so far as I've been able to ask for a hand, there's no incident.

07:44.220 --> 07:48.220
There's no incident for you at the midst of the training because of the many work.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.220
I have one other half here,

07:49.220 --> 07:54.020
I had a fair deploy work for a less one of the circumstances that he could not.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.420
As you know, I have a many of the changes and pretty correct of the day

07:57.420 --> 08:00.020
about the prompts to mention the memorandum.

08:00.020 --> 08:03.420
However, in a current situation due of the change of plans,

08:03.420 --> 08:05.420
I cannot criticize him.

08:05.420 --> 08:08.420
I think he should also know that during the past month,

08:08.420 --> 08:11.020
since we had been closely associated with Jeanne Adams,

08:11.020 --> 08:15.420
I have a number of locations talked to him on the subject of Dave Shines.

08:15.420 --> 08:20.820
In all instances, I can remember the topic either came as a conversation as a result.

08:20.820 --> 08:23.820
As a natural result, some of our subjects were discussing

08:23.820 --> 08:28.420
our Adam and the facetious plans made some statements concerning the full postage

08:28.420 --> 08:30.420
of the dinner party.

08:30.420 --> 08:33.820
I've always taken a position where I personally have no particular interest

08:33.820 --> 08:37.420
in Dave Shines through Dave Shines Army career.

08:37.420 --> 08:41.820
However, I have upon all of the locations he has been discussed,

08:41.820 --> 08:46.420
taken a position that although he deserves no special consideration,

08:46.420 --> 08:51.620
he certainly should not be penalized because of the former action of the committee.

08:51.620 --> 08:55.020
I remember these locations I have stated that with my opinion,

08:55.020 --> 08:59.020
the training was getting assignment, which he was qualifying,

08:59.020 --> 09:05.420
and which he could actually use for the Army in an industrial position.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.420
I have never heard of it.

09:07.420 --> 09:11.420
I have never heard of it suggested that there is a assignment of the other one,

09:11.420 --> 09:16.420
which he is entitled to by all Army standards of their play.

09:16.420 --> 09:20.220
So every day, the Minister of Justice, in case there's any misunderstanding

09:20.220 --> 09:24.220
about this memorandum, then I expect that he's that, is that the entire memorandum?

09:24.220 --> 09:25.420
Yes, sir.

09:25.420 --> 09:27.420
Who voted first?

09:27.420 --> 09:28.920
I told you I had done this.

09:28.920 --> 09:33.420
Mr. Carr, I had given you the impression that any unfairness in my examination

09:33.420 --> 09:34.920
in respect of this memorandum.

09:34.920 --> 09:35.920
No, sir.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.920
Thank you.

09:36.920 --> 09:42.220
Now, looking at the second power path of this same memorandum of December 31, 1963,

09:42.220 --> 09:48.020
I noticed the words, I agreed that Comtack with him should be kept at a minimum.

09:48.020 --> 09:52.020
With whom were you so agreed?

09:52.020 --> 09:53.720
What's on him, MacArthur?

09:53.720 --> 09:56.420
You and he had talked about that matter, is that right?

09:56.420 --> 09:57.220
Yes, sir.

09:57.220 --> 10:03.720
And you and he had reached the new movement, but Comtack with shines should be kept at a minimum.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.720
Well, you say, reaching the agreement, I agreed with him at this point of memorandum.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.220
Well, you agreed with each other.

10:09.220 --> 10:10.220
Yes.

10:10.220 --> 10:12.220
No.

10:12.220 --> 10:19.020
Roll to the next to the last power path, if you will, and let me make you a senator just red.

10:19.020 --> 10:22.720
I think you should also know that during the past month,

10:22.720 --> 10:25.920
since we have been closely associated with John Adams,

10:25.920 --> 10:31.220
I have on numerous occasions talked to him on the subject of Dave's time.

10:31.220 --> 10:34.720
There is no doubt about the accuracy of that statement, is that I have just read it,

10:34.720 --> 10:35.720
you and Mr. Carr.

10:35.720 --> 10:36.720
No, sir.

10:36.720 --> 10:42.320
You and Adams talk on numerous occasions about Dave's time.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.320
Right, sir.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.720
There's one such occasion on the train ride from North to Washington?

10:46.720 --> 10:48.320
Ah, yes, sir.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.920
In all instances, I have read it again.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.720
In all instances that I can remember, the topic you became into the conversation

10:53.720 --> 10:56.920
was the natural result of some other subdued-able discussions.

10:56.920 --> 11:01.620
All Adams in a prestigious way made some statements concerning the hospice.

11:01.620 --> 11:05.620
Is it true that Adams would make statements concerning the hospice to you

11:05.620 --> 11:07.120
with a prestigious way?

11:07.120 --> 11:08.120
Yes, sir.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.020
They couldn't have scared you then, could they?

11:10.020 --> 11:11.020
No, sir.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.120
They couldn't have brought me up, didn't they?

11:13.120 --> 11:14.120
No, sir.

11:14.120 --> 11:18.120
They couldn't have been ordered to hang in gangling small favors in front of you for Dave.

11:18.920 --> 11:19.920
They couldn't.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.020
And once again, you'd say in the next sentence,

11:22.020 --> 11:26.620
I have always taken the position that I personally have no particular or

11:26.620 --> 11:29.020
discrimination on each of the layers.

11:29.020 --> 11:32.420
That's the second time it is that I'm in order that you say that, isn't it?

11:32.420 --> 11:33.920
No, I think so.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.420
It's right.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.520
We talked about running the radio about a while ago.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.020
Was there someone on the committee?

11:40.020 --> 11:42.720
Whose tradition was somewhat different from yours?

11:42.720 --> 11:44.520
No, sir.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.020
You don't happen to say everyone on the committee has always taken the position

11:48.020 --> 11:49.620
that we have no orders today, did I?

11:49.620 --> 11:50.620
I'm doing it.

11:50.620 --> 11:51.620
No, I...

11:51.620 --> 11:52.620
I should have...

11:52.620 --> 11:56.620
All the unions when you mention this, you say I personally have no orders today, did I?

11:56.620 --> 11:58.620
That's correct.

11:58.620 --> 12:03.620
Now when you look at the memorandum of January 9, 1954,

12:03.620 --> 12:06.620
and think it's short and since the cemetery,

12:06.620 --> 12:10.820
read one on which I had his am, I will read it to you.

12:10.820 --> 12:13.620
It's headed to Contra Damper for one thing.

12:13.620 --> 12:17.820
It's dated January 9, 1954, and it's commuter-roy-could, is that right?

12:17.820 --> 12:18.820
Yes.

12:18.820 --> 12:21.020
It's a month again with the case of a disaster.

12:21.020 --> 12:22.020
Yes.

12:22.020 --> 12:26.020
I called on Adam about the questions of the inserts from the annual report

12:26.020 --> 12:28.620
where he's changed the Miami security program.

12:28.620 --> 12:33.020
Also, I also told him he was trying to receive about days...

12:33.020 --> 12:35.420
not being free from any help with the report.

12:35.420 --> 12:38.420
He was at the Amherst Mall, said he was slow-bound,

12:38.420 --> 12:41.420
and that he couldn't do a thing about it from Massachusetts.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.620
I'm sure that he doesn't want to do anything,

12:43.620 --> 12:46.020
but I told him he was tall.

12:46.020 --> 12:48.020
I think he was up to it.

12:48.020 --> 12:51.420
It is obvious that he doesn't want the part about army last of these

12:51.420 --> 12:56.420
in the report, so don't expect days to get off to help.

12:56.420 --> 13:03.220
Was that a memorandum dictated to inform or to record something?

13:03.220 --> 13:04.820
Record something.

13:04.820 --> 13:08.420
Everything that's covered in it has been discussed by you

13:08.420 --> 13:10.220
and calling on the telephone, had it not?

13:10.220 --> 13:11.220
Yes, sir.

13:11.220 --> 13:15.020
And indeed, you had talked to Mr. Cohn before you dictated the memorandum,

13:15.020 --> 13:17.220
and he suggested that you make it, is that right?

13:17.220 --> 13:18.620
Yes, sir.

13:18.620 --> 13:21.020
Now then, in the memorandum, strike that out.

13:21.020 --> 13:23.020
Incidentally, under those circumstances,

13:23.020 --> 13:25.220
it would have been sensible to have directed the memorandum

13:25.220 --> 13:26.420
to the file.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.620
As you did, number 11, would it not?

13:28.620 --> 13:29.620
It might have been yesterday.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.220
Much more sensible, wasn't it?

13:31.220 --> 13:33.220
Perhaps, because it wasn't anything you were telling

13:33.220 --> 13:35.220
you were telling, calling that he didn't know.

13:35.220 --> 13:36.820
That might have been fair.

13:36.820 --> 13:40.020
Now, you say in this memorandum,

13:40.020 --> 13:42.220
I am sure he doesn't want to do anything,

13:42.220 --> 13:45.020
but I told him you would call.

13:45.020 --> 13:48.020
When you dictated that, Cohn had already called,

13:48.020 --> 13:49.020
hadn't he?

13:49.020 --> 13:50.020
Yes, sir.

13:50.020 --> 13:53.820
And the next one, I think he will duck you.

13:53.820 --> 13:56.020
Had him said it already, Dr. Inhadid.

13:56.020 --> 13:57.420
Yes, sir.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.820
And the next one, it is obvious that he doesn't want

13:59.820 --> 14:02.420
the part about anti-raccy in the report.

14:02.420 --> 14:06.020
So don't expect days to get off to help.

14:06.020 --> 14:10.020
You've already told Cohn the day he wasn't going to get off to help.

14:10.020 --> 14:10.820
Yes, sir.

14:10.820 --> 14:15.220
And you take the services of us to Margot for the send you make,

14:15.220 --> 14:17.020
memorandum up and move on.

14:17.020 --> 14:21.220
And say, so don't expect days to get off to help.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.620
Yes.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.820
Incentive, please.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.820
What day of the week was January 9th, on, if you recall?

14:27.820 --> 14:29.620
I think it was Saturday.

14:29.620 --> 14:34.020
Isn't that the Saturday, whether this man took a monitor call

14:34.020 --> 14:35.820
which has been introduced here in evidence?

14:35.820 --> 14:36.620
Yes, sir.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.220
Not in part of the call.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.220
Part of the call, and the call that you made it.

14:40.220 --> 14:43.620
Adam, in Amherst, this is Justice.

14:43.620 --> 14:47.420
What time of day did you dictate this memorandum that I have just read

14:47.420 --> 14:50.020
with his number eighties?

14:50.020 --> 14:51.420
Sometime that afternoon.

14:51.420 --> 14:54.220
And this is then, was in your office.

14:54.220 --> 14:55.220
I think she was.

14:55.220 --> 14:59.620
And if just taken, I assume I have recently taken that monitor call.

14:59.620 --> 15:00.620
Yes, sir.

15:00.620 --> 15:02.220
No, but the rest.

15:02.220 --> 15:06.820
You found it necessary to climb three flights of stairs

15:06.820 --> 15:09.820
to dictate this to Mrs. Vistula.

15:10.220 --> 15:11.420
Is that right?

15:11.420 --> 15:12.420
No.

15:12.420 --> 15:13.420
No, sir.

15:13.420 --> 15:14.420
Well, did you take the elevator?

15:14.420 --> 15:15.420
Yes, sir.

15:15.420 --> 15:16.420
To the elevator.

15:16.420 --> 15:17.420
Is that right, sir?

15:17.420 --> 15:18.420
Yes, sir.

15:18.420 --> 15:19.420
Yes, sir.

15:19.420 --> 15:20.420
Yes, sir.

15:20.420 --> 15:25.020
And had to go up to her room to dictate this memorandum,

15:25.020 --> 15:27.420
when the wrong secretary was sitting right beside you,

15:27.420 --> 15:28.420
was that right?

15:28.420 --> 15:29.420
Yes, sir.

15:29.420 --> 15:32.820
I'm afraid, Mr. Welch, you will be shocked that when you learned

15:32.820 --> 15:35.540
that I believe it was on the same Saturday that

15:35.540 --> 15:38.620
particularly the entire staff was working in connection with one

15:38.620 --> 15:41.420
of the officers, so that I don't mean this, sir.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.220
Men was there, but there was several others there.

15:43.220 --> 15:45.020
And you were busy as they can, too?

15:45.020 --> 15:46.020
Yes, sir.

15:46.020 --> 15:48.020
And didn't have much time to ride up and down the elevator.

15:48.020 --> 15:49.020
No, sir.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.620
And you certainly could have saved some time

15:50.620 --> 15:52.420
in dictating this memorandum.

15:52.420 --> 15:54.420
If you just said this is them,

15:54.420 --> 15:56.420
take a memorandum from me to go.

15:56.420 --> 15:57.420
Ah, yes, sir.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.420
And at the time you did it.

15:59.420 --> 16:03.820
You didn't know Mrs. Vistula was running this file, did you?

16:03.820 --> 16:04.820
I don't think so much.

16:04.820 --> 16:06.220
You just didn't know that at all.

16:06.220 --> 16:07.020
I don't think so.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.420
That's right.

16:08.420 --> 16:12.220
Now I may I move on to the number 10 of January 15th.

16:12.220 --> 16:15.020
Well, that's a very hard one.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.020
May I read it to you, sir?

16:17.020 --> 16:20.820
Maybe the Senate January 15th, 1954,

16:20.820 --> 16:22.820
is from you to Senator McCarthy.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.420
Is that right?

16:24.420 --> 16:25.220
Yes, sir.

16:25.220 --> 16:26.820
And it's short.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.820
Maybe one of these days you should speak to John Adams

16:29.820 --> 16:31.420
in a friendly way.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.420
I've tried.

16:33.420 --> 16:37.820
He is living all the pretty much lately on the hostage situation.

16:37.820 --> 16:38.620
They get pretty.

16:38.620 --> 16:41.220
He did before a roared by the lunch.

16:41.220 --> 16:44.020
But it's going to lead to trouble.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.620
That's all of this to the memorandum, isn't it?

16:45.620 --> 16:46.620
Yes, sir.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.820
And that was dictated to Mrs. Vistula.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.020
Well, sorry, call a memorandum.

16:51.020 --> 16:51.620
It wasn't.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.020
You've already told me it was.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.020
It's dictated to her.

16:54.020 --> 16:55.820
No, now they want to change it, sir?

16:55.820 --> 16:56.820
No, sir, I'm not changing.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.220
I would, sir.

16:58.220 --> 16:59.820
I think the testimony will be on me out.

16:59.820 --> 17:01.620
I don't think I said that I dictated it.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.620
I think it did say it.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.620
It will say that, sir, but change it if you'd like.

17:04.620 --> 17:05.620
Ah, no.

17:05.620 --> 17:08.820
Well, if it doesn't say it, then I'm not changing it.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.820
Yes, all right, sir.

17:10.820 --> 17:15.020
The actual practice, as I recall, and this is probably

17:15.020 --> 17:17.820
the only memorandum that I recall too much in my life,

17:17.820 --> 17:21.020
is the test of what the witness is testified to.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.700
Can I think of fairness to the witness that Mr.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.020
Rouse should read the testimony to him?

17:25.020 --> 17:25.820
We haven't got it.

17:25.820 --> 17:27.220
I think the witness is okay to you about now.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.020
You can get it.

17:29.020 --> 17:30.020
Go ahead.

17:30.020 --> 17:33.020
I'm going to be wrong in getting my recollection

17:33.020 --> 17:34.020
that you said you dictated it.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.220
Well, it is, it isn't.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.620
It isn't important point on that.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.620
It isn't important on that.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.420
I can tell you what happened if you want me to.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.620
Well, what I'd like to know is whether or not you dictated

17:43.620 --> 17:44.820
if you visit the dresser.

17:44.820 --> 17:46.020
Well, it's just now.

17:46.020 --> 17:48.420
Can you tell me, yes or no?

17:48.420 --> 17:49.620
I can tell you.

17:49.620 --> 17:50.220
No.

17:50.220 --> 17:51.620
No.

17:51.620 --> 17:52.820
Now?

17:52.820 --> 17:54.820
To whom did you dictate it?

17:54.820 --> 17:56.820
Well, you say that we're getting technical.

17:56.820 --> 17:58.820
I don't know where I didn't get it.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.020
I know where I was.

18:00.020 --> 18:01.020
I'm a little troubled.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.020
If you're suggesting that I'm a witness,

18:03.020 --> 18:04.020
answer the questioner.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.620
The words can't be so dangerous.

18:05.620 --> 18:06.820
It's only because of the law.

18:06.820 --> 18:07.820
So whether you dictated it,

18:07.820 --> 18:08.420
if you want them,

18:08.420 --> 18:09.420
they have to answer the question.

18:09.420 --> 18:10.420
That's right.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.420
That's a standard.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.220
It wasn't dictated in the dresser.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.620
No, it wasn't.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.620
It wasn't dictated in the dresser.

18:16.620 --> 18:18.620
Was it dictated to anyone?

18:18.620 --> 18:19.620
No, sir.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.620
I can print this out very easily.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.620
Well, I saw where I got it.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.820
I'm so clumsy, but I'll probably finally get there.

18:25.820 --> 18:26.820
It was dictated to no one.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.620
Is that right?

18:28.620 --> 18:30.820
We'll see what the answer is.

18:30.820 --> 18:31.820
Yes, he can answer.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.620
All right, sir.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.220
It was dictated to no one.

18:34.220 --> 18:36.420
And the answer then is that you scribbled it out.

18:36.420 --> 18:37.020
Is that right?

18:37.020 --> 18:37.820
That's right.

18:37.820 --> 18:39.220
And handed it to you.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.020
Mr. Schultz.

18:40.020 --> 18:41.820
To Mr. Schultz, to tight.

18:41.820 --> 18:42.820
Yes.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.420
On that note, we've been talking about...

18:44.420 --> 18:46.220
That's why I tried to get around with this.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.420
Yes.

18:47.420 --> 18:50.220
Well, now I'm suggesting to you that this is just good.

18:50.220 --> 18:52.420
It's not tight, but do you see anything about the number

18:52.420 --> 18:55.020
and the indicates that to you?

18:55.020 --> 18:55.420
That's...

18:55.420 --> 18:57.220
Let me just say it's a bit tight, but it's not tight.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.620
No, I think it's not tight.

18:58.620 --> 18:59.420
That's to get it.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.020
Mr. Chairman.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.420
So, did you find the right?

19:02.420 --> 19:03.420
Yes.

19:03.420 --> 19:05.820
Mr. Woltz, I said I am suggesting that Mr. Schultz

19:05.820 --> 19:06.820
did not place this.

19:06.820 --> 19:10.620
Mr. Schultz, on the fan, she saw that she did.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.420
The administerer at Woltz wants to make any suggestions

19:13.420 --> 19:15.220
that she's not tight.

19:15.220 --> 19:20.220
Then Mr. Woltz should take the oath and...

19:20.220 --> 19:22.220
What information?

19:22.220 --> 19:23.820
I don't even think it might correct you, Mr. Woltz,

19:23.820 --> 19:25.820
but it won't move me.

19:25.820 --> 19:29.220
Mr. Woltz, I'm being awfully...

19:29.220 --> 19:30.620
Especially in the U.N.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.420
If you have any information, this is...

19:33.420 --> 19:34.420
This role.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.420
So, not telling the truth.

19:36.420 --> 19:39.220
Then you should be willing to do what I have done,

19:39.220 --> 19:42.020
but Mr. Carr is doing what Mr. Cullen has done,

19:42.020 --> 19:44.420
but my assistant public intelligence has done.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.420
Take the oath and give us information.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.020
I will give you very important information

19:49.020 --> 19:50.620
if you have such information.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.620
I have not been to else.

19:52.620 --> 19:56.020
And let me say, you see there, you see there are power dyes

19:56.020 --> 19:58.620
coming for the Mr. Dosto, our take the oath

19:58.620 --> 20:00.820
and tell us what information is made

20:00.820 --> 20:03.620
and who it under oath, the way that Woltz has done.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.420
I will tell you in the next question.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.420
This memorandum is one of the last.

20:07.420 --> 20:10.620
P-Cars, does not it appear right in front of you?

20:10.620 --> 20:13.020
It's from Francis P-Cars, isn't it?

20:13.020 --> 20:14.020
Yes, sir.

20:14.020 --> 20:17.020
She never calls with Francis in her life, does she?

20:17.020 --> 20:20.020
Well, sometimes she calls me Mr. Carr.

20:20.020 --> 20:22.620
Yes, but you told me at the beginning of your...

20:22.620 --> 20:24.820
examination that she calls you Frank.

20:24.820 --> 20:25.620
Yes, sir.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.420
And he never calls you Frank.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.620
He usually calls me Frank at the...

20:29.620 --> 20:32.220
Now I shall name all others Francis P-Cars.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.020
I understand that, sir.

20:34.020 --> 20:37.420
But you are known in the office as Frank Carr, aren't you?

20:37.420 --> 20:38.220
Yes, sir.

20:38.220 --> 20:41.820
And every other memorandum that she calls you Frank Carr.

20:41.820 --> 20:44.020
And he addresses you.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.220
You, you, Malibu sir?

20:45.220 --> 20:46.420
Yes, sir.

20:46.420 --> 20:47.420
You, my wife?

20:47.420 --> 20:49.420
Yes, I am a very important personal privilege

20:49.420 --> 20:51.420
for my staffs, as myself.

20:51.420 --> 20:54.020
Very many memorandum in my office.

20:54.020 --> 20:58.820
From Francis P-Cars, from Francis P-Cars, from Frank Carr,

20:58.820 --> 21:02.520
to Mr. Carr, and it's Mr. Welts,

21:02.520 --> 21:05.320
once the driver of Q's, a young lady,

21:05.320 --> 21:08.820
because she says Francis will fit a prank.

21:08.820 --> 21:12.020
A lying understand and could take that fanding cell.

21:12.020 --> 21:15.220
But, well, it just isn't honest.

21:15.220 --> 21:17.620
You just sit there and it's Q's.

21:17.620 --> 21:20.020
This young lady, I'm not going to shoot,

21:20.020 --> 21:23.020
because she writes Francis will fit a prank.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.020
Excuse me, Mr. Welts.

21:26.020 --> 21:30.920
Now I call your attention to accept the memorandum number 11.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.520
When you look at that, sir.

21:33.520 --> 21:38.720
Yes, that's the last one in the state of March of February 1954.

21:38.720 --> 21:39.620
Yes, sir.

21:39.620 --> 21:43.320
And when that you excuse these words about the middle of it,

21:43.320 --> 21:46.120
referring to a telephone call from Senator McCarthy

21:46.120 --> 21:48.720
to a Mr. Seeking.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.920
You say Senator McCarthy advised Mr. Seeking

21:51.920 --> 21:55.620
that the writer was searching the files for memorandum

21:55.620 --> 21:58.420
dictated concerning signs.

21:58.420 --> 22:02.020
You notice the word FI-L-E-S files?

22:02.020 --> 22:03.120
Yes, sir.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.820
What files did you first search?

22:05.820 --> 22:07.820
I didn't search any files.

22:07.820 --> 22:11.220
When you say in memorandum that you heard Senator McCarthy

22:11.220 --> 22:13.320
tell Seeking that you were searching files.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.120
Us, director.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.220
And it is not true that you were searching files.

22:18.220 --> 22:21.920
The memorandum says that Senator McCarthy told Mr. Seeking

22:21.920 --> 22:26.020
that the writer, that's me, will be searching the files

22:26.020 --> 22:27.020
for memorandum.

22:27.020 --> 22:27.520
Right.

22:27.520 --> 22:32.620
Now my question is, is that true that you were searching FI-L-E-S?

22:32.620 --> 22:35.720
Senator McCarthy told him that I was searching the files.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.420
Senator McCarthy is correct.

22:38.420 --> 22:41.720
In his statement, I'm correct in mind.

22:41.720 --> 22:45.520
Senator McCarthy told me to search the files.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.720
I told the Army came.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.220
I asked somebody else to search.

22:48.220 --> 22:49.120
Yes?

22:49.120 --> 22:52.720
And what files did you have search?

22:52.720 --> 22:53.620
Frankly, I don't know.

22:53.620 --> 22:54.220
I asked Mary.

22:54.220 --> 22:55.220
Why did you make files?

22:55.220 --> 22:56.020
Did you know?

22:56.020 --> 22:57.220
No.

22:57.220 --> 22:58.720
Did Senator spy on?

22:58.720 --> 23:03.020
No, I asked Mary Gusko if she would check to see if she had

23:03.020 --> 23:05.320
any of them in the random that had been dictated to us.

23:05.320 --> 23:10.520
And she came up with this memorandum that is exhibit number

23:10.520 --> 23:12.420
31.

23:12.420 --> 23:12.920
Yes.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.320
And it's existence I take it.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.520
Was they glad to find it to you?

23:17.520 --> 23:17.820
No, sure.

23:17.820 --> 23:19.420
Wasn't it surprised me?

23:19.420 --> 23:20.920
Were we going to be glad?

23:20.920 --> 23:22.620
To find it?

23:22.620 --> 23:23.220
No, sir.

23:23.220 --> 23:24.120
I don't have any excuse.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.420
I didn't see it happen around somewhere.

23:26.420 --> 23:27.020
You didn't know.

23:27.020 --> 23:28.520
You kept the search.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.020
No, sir.

23:29.020 --> 23:29.520
But it doesn't tell you.

23:29.520 --> 23:34.020
When you came to talk to see it about the memorandum,

23:34.020 --> 23:37.520
all of a sudden, they all appeared, bound together

23:37.520 --> 23:39.220
as I now have them in my hand.

23:39.220 --> 23:41.220
Is that right?

23:41.220 --> 23:44.120
Ah, well, I don't know where.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.520
I don't know where they all of a sudden appeared that way.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.420
Well, we're bound together when you saw them.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.420
When I saw them, yes.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.120
They were just as I hold them here.

23:51.120 --> 23:51.920
I think so, sir.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.760
And have this just handed them to you before you

23:54.760 --> 23:56.420
dictated this memorandum?

23:56.420 --> 23:58.320
I'll ask you it.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.420
I really don't know.

23:59.420 --> 23:59.920
You don't know?

23:59.920 --> 24:01.920
No.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.020
This is a record memorandum.

24:05.020 --> 24:08.320
I didn't miss a chance in that though.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.920
Mr. Sincer, you can go to the witness room.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.720
Yes.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.620
And the other session, there was this before asking

24:12.620 --> 24:13.820
me to step down the car, and I said,

24:13.820 --> 24:15.020
that's just one question.

24:15.020 --> 24:15.820
And I'm looking.

24:15.820 --> 24:18.620
You can figure out, you know, anything

24:18.620 --> 24:22.820
that has ever done, my name is Takone,

24:22.820 --> 24:25.620
I need help from the staff, for the new proper nature,

24:25.620 --> 24:27.220
for you can get any special consideration

24:27.220 --> 24:28.900
from it to shine or anyone else,

24:28.900 --> 24:30.120
with the new authoring.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.620
No, sir, I know another proper act.

24:32.620 --> 24:33.620
No, sir.

24:33.620 --> 24:34.620
One question.

24:34.620 --> 24:35.620
Uh-huh.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.220
And the record is a question far from the references

24:38.220 --> 24:40.020
that made to the part of the sign drop,

24:40.020 --> 24:42.920
the carrying, and then you got out now,

24:42.920 --> 24:45.020
what it meant by the sign has terminated

24:45.020 --> 24:46.920
against services, but it's up to me,

24:46.920 --> 24:47.920
or it's up to me, or it's up to me,

24:47.920 --> 24:50.920
or it's up to me, or it's up to me, or it's up to me.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.120
No, he's no longer with the subcommittee.

24:53.120 --> 24:53.920
Terminated.

24:53.920 --> 24:54.920
It's up to me.

24:54.920 --> 24:55.920
Yes.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.920
I'll put you in that very footage,

24:57.920 --> 25:00.420
and then the patient against using the station area,

25:00.420 --> 25:01.620
if the committee is going to be on it,

25:01.620 --> 25:03.420
if the facility is with the subcommittee.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.920
Yes.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.620
Any other questions, Mr. Sincer?

25:06.620 --> 25:07.920
Just one last one.

25:07.920 --> 25:13.920
It's a private sign, completed last work,

25:13.920 --> 25:15.920
so we have a full record for the committee.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.520
And I think it was the writing of the

25:22.520 --> 25:24.520
preparations of the report.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.520
One preparation of the report?

25:25.520 --> 25:28.520
What date was that?

25:28.520 --> 25:32.120
The last report I think went to the frontiers

25:32.120 --> 25:36.720
of the 19th of January, it's some summer in the States.

25:36.720 --> 25:40.520
And with some time prior to that, that he completed all

25:40.520 --> 25:42.120
of his work for the committee.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.520
That's five I know, so yes.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.120
I will try to make that sound.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
It's called the next report.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.120
This is my next time.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.120
Come.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.120
Right here.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.320
Come.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.120
Mr. Cone, your repeat is a bit swarring,

25:55.120 --> 25:57.120
and I so can't find my notes, you might be mad.

25:57.120 --> 26:00.320
Just sign in the column, just imagine, like that.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.320
Sure.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.320
Where I should have found some of those going to the room.

26:06.320 --> 26:09.320
There I get the look, the letters, I've been assigned

26:09.320 --> 26:10.320
for the last report.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.320
Yes.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.320
Now, I'm trying to get in that way.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.320
Yes.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.320
I have to put a little encouragement in the

26:15.320 --> 26:18.320
committee to the purposes of identifying the documents

26:18.320 --> 26:20.320
that they sign in the column under asking some questions

26:20.320 --> 26:21.320
about these documents.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.320
You may be surprised.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.320
Mr. Cone, I addressed myself, too.

26:31.320 --> 26:36.320
Certain documents, or a member and a, which you've already been

26:36.320 --> 26:39.320
referred to, can I help hold up which?

26:39.320 --> 26:41.320
I don't think you should go there tonight.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.320
I don't know.

26:42.320 --> 26:45.320
You can go and add me to the next report.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.320
I'll tell you later, I'll be there.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.320
Okay.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.320
We got that Jenkins operator that you know what you need.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.320
Call him.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.320
One must go, I really get to the resignation.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.320
That's returned to us.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.320
Just call my address myself, too.

27:04.320 --> 27:08.320
Certain member and, which you've already been referred to,

27:08.320 --> 27:14.320
or a rep who's any of the rest of Mr. Shine.
