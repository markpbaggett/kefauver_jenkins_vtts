Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this is Charlie Caldwell, Senator S. Keef

00:17.640 --> 00:21.480
Arvers Administrative Assistant. I have him back from Tennessee now and I'd like to

00:21.480 --> 00:25.760
ask him about the latest developments on the TVA self-financing bill.

00:25.760 --> 00:31.220
Well, Charlie Caldwell, as you know, the bill was brought out from the Public Works Committee

00:31.220 --> 00:39.500
about ten days ago, but then some opposition came about as to the territorial expansion

00:39.500 --> 00:45.700
two and a half percent of the territory and so it was referred back to the Public Works Committee

00:45.700 --> 00:50.540
and now it's been brought out again in its ready-for-centage action. The bill as it now stands

00:50.540 --> 00:57.580
allows the TVA to sell bonds up to the extent of $750 million at any one time. Then it has

00:57.580 --> 01:05.580
a provision for a maximum expansion of territory by two and a half percent to take care of unusual

01:05.580 --> 01:11.980
frame situations or the increase in the population of a community on the border. That was what

01:11.980 --> 01:17.180
was subjected to. In the Committee of the Second Time, it was provided that not more than

01:17.180 --> 01:21.340
one fourth or twenty percent of this two and a half percent could be used to expand the

01:21.340 --> 01:27.620
territory in any one state. So that seems to be satisfactory and by the time we report

01:27.620 --> 01:34.340
to you next week we hope very much that the TVA self-financing bill will have been considered

01:34.340 --> 01:38.440
by the Senate in past and we hope that he's going to be signed by the President.

01:38.440 --> 01:43.120
Senator, I believe you and several colleagues had an opportunity to show Senator Kerr

01:43.120 --> 01:46.600
of Oklahoma the TVA system the past week. Is that correct?

01:46.600 --> 01:53.400
Yes, we had a wonderful trip down to the TVA to the Valley and I've been seeing all the

01:53.400 --> 02:01.040
dams and fertilizer plants and the steam plants many times but Senator Kerr of Oklahoma has

02:01.040 --> 02:06.480
chairman of the subcommittee that handles TVA and the Public Works Committee has been,

02:06.480 --> 02:12.920
of course, our great friend and has handled the self-financing bill so that Senator Gore

02:12.920 --> 02:20.240
and Senator Sparkman and I along with General Vogel and Mr. Jones of the TVA board, Mr.

02:20.240 --> 02:25.720
Wesson-Hauer, the power head of the power development and others. We went down to see the TVA.

02:25.720 --> 02:34.200
We circled around most of the great many of the dams beginning at South Holston. We would

02:34.200 --> 02:41.320
see the reservoir, the lake and the house being developed for recreation and we'd see the dam.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.320
We stopped at Knoxville for a little while and visited with friends there, then went

02:45.320 --> 02:50.640
over to Kingston's steam plant and down to Chattanooga where we had lunch for the TVA

02:50.640 --> 02:56.060
power board and many public officials' matters. Then we visited the fertilizer plant and Wilson

02:56.060 --> 03:01.680
dam down at Muscle Shoals and the people in that section had a big chamber of commerce

03:01.680 --> 03:09.560
meeting for us. Governor Ellington joined us at Knoxville and he was very good to have

03:09.560 --> 03:14.600
him, he and Senator Kerr old friends and so great time has had by all Senator Kerr was

03:14.600 --> 03:17.720
very much impressed. Senator, I understand that you came out on the

03:17.720 --> 03:23.240
short end of a discussion about the relative merit of Black Angus cattle and white-faced

03:23.240 --> 03:27.040
herfers. Well, when we weren't busy looking at dams or steam plants, the discussion was

03:27.040 --> 03:32.400
about the merits of Black Angus at which Senator Kerr and Governor Ellington, Senator

03:32.400 --> 03:39.560
Gore or Advocates and I tried to hold up a little bit the other side because my aunt

03:39.560 --> 03:44.920
has white-faced herfers but it was three to one so I don't know, I guess they won the

03:44.920 --> 03:52.760
argument. Senator, we have just a few moments more. Would you tell us what's going on in

03:52.760 --> 03:57.000
the bread hearings with the Antitrust Subcommittee? I'd like to introduce Rand Dixon's chief

03:57.000 --> 04:00.760
counsel for that committee. Yes, we've been having hearings about bread and Rand who

04:00.760 --> 04:06.280
comes from Nashville is our chief counsel of our monopoly committee and also the head

04:06.280 --> 04:10.800
of the Tennessee State Society here in Washington. So you tell us about it Rand? Well, we've

04:10.800 --> 04:15.920
had some very interesting hearings you know Senator, we are trying to understand why

04:15.920 --> 04:21.400
the price of bread in the last ten years has gone up from 12.5 cents to approximately

04:21.400 --> 04:28.400
19.5 cents while at the same time the farmer is getting less for a bushel of wheat. Well,

04:28.400 --> 04:34.000
what are we finding out about it? Well, we are finding this out, sir, that the large

04:34.000 --> 04:41.040
major bakery chains have a systematic type of pricing where prices will be high we might

04:41.040 --> 04:45.920
say in the metropolitan area and low and small areas. Well, fortunately it's not as high

04:45.920 --> 04:50.400
in Tennessee as in some of the larger cities of the northeast and maybe we can discuss

04:50.400 --> 04:54.160
this more next time. That's all for now and thank you very much until next week.
