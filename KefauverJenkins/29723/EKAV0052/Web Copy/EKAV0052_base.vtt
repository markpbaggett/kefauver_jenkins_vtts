00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee,

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
spending within the past week took action on two bills of importance.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
The first was the so-called Clean Elections Bill.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
After a number of amendments were adopted on the floor, this bill was passed

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
by a vote of 59 to 22 and went to the House of Representatives.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
The bill strengthens the requirement for reporting of campaign expenditures

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
in quite a number of ways.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
It places a $10,000 limit on the amount any individual can contribute to any camp.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
It requires reporting of campaign contributions and connection with primaries

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
as well as general elections involving federal officers.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
It requires reports from states and local committees spending more than $2,500

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
for the benefit of federal candidates.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
It also provides the detailed financial statements be filed with federal district courts

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
where they will be available to the press of the various states,

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
as well as with the clerks of the House and of the Senate.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
The bill makes campaigns spending limitations more realistic

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
and puts teeth on a law which has been for all practical purposes,

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
loosely drawn and largely ignored.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
An amendment that I introduced did not pass.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I reintroduced this in form of a bill and hope that further consideration may be given it.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
My amendment was designed to encourage small contributions to campaigns

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
by a much larger number of citizens.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
It would permit a $10 tax credit or $100 tax deduction for campaign contributions.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Turning to another subject in the field of juvenile delinquency,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
the Senate passed a bill which would provide grants to the states

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
for study demonstration projects on a nationwide scale.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
The bill would also provide funds over the next five years

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
for the training of personnel to work in the juvenile delinquency field.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Juvenile delinquency, as we all know, is one of the most serious major problems in the nation today.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
It has been steadily increasing for the past ten years.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Few communities have escaped its impact and it can no longer be thought of as being confined

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
within the boundaries of neighborhoods, local communities, or even states.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
The effects of juvenile delinquency are violent, disrespect for human value,

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
and property value, and a most dangerous weakening of our moral structure in our society.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm happy that the Senate has taken this positive step toward attacking this problem

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
and hopeful that the House will concur in the action.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
I was happy to be a sponsor along with Senator Hinnings of this legislation.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
As I make this broadcast to you in Tennessee,

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
to you in Tennessee, the Senate is debating a constitutional amendment which I have proposed.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
This amendment would empower the governors of several states to fill vacancies

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
and the House of Representatives in case of a nuclear attack on Washington.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Several attempts have been made in the past to get similar amendments passed, but they have failed.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm hopeful the Senate and the House will pass it this time with resounding majorities.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I believe the amendment is more urgently needed today than ever before.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
It would plug a loophole in our Constitution which could not have been foreseen by our founding fathers.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
If a nuclear attack should occur in heaven for bed that it should,

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
it is almost certain that a large number of congressmen would be killed or fatally wounded.

03:20.000 --> 03:28.000
Under the law as it now stands, only the House of Representatives could not be quickly reconstituted after a devastating attack.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Vacancies in the judicial branch and in the Senate could be filled by appointment.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
A long line of succession is provided by the Constitution and federal statutes for the Office of Chief Executive.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Vacancies in the House of Representatives can be filled only by election of the people.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
If a nuclear attack were to wipe out half of our congressmen, it would be vital that the government get back in action as quickly as possible

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
and the House could not act if a point of no quorum were made on the first day.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
My amendment would enable the governors to appoint vacancies in the House of Representatives for a period of 60 days only.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
The primary argument against this amendment is that it is born out of fear and panic.

04:10.000 --> 04:21.000
To me this is the same as saying that a husband should never buy a life insurance or fear of frightening his wife or that a parent should not have his child vaccinated for fear of frightening the child.

04:21.000 --> 04:32.000
I am working hard for the adoption of this amendment SJRS39 and hope we will be able to amend the Constitution to take out this serious loophole.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
That's all for this time. Thank you and goodbye until next week.
