00:30.000 --> 00:55.880
Hello and welcome to another edition of Washington Spotlight.

00:55.880 --> 01:00.560
The important political question this week is, can the Republicans win the presidency?

01:00.560 --> 01:05.860
I'm here to discuss it, our Senator Esteskeet, the governor of Tennessee, a Democrat, Senator

01:05.860 --> 01:09.080
Richard Nixon of California, a Republican.

01:09.080 --> 01:14.720
For 20 years, five successive terms the Democrats have been in power in Washington.

01:14.720 --> 01:19.720
So for the Republicans, this becomes a crucial campaign with perhaps the two party system

01:19.720 --> 01:21.640
as we have known it at stake.

01:21.640 --> 01:26.640
As we see, as we move into this hot campaign, foreign policy is likely to become the vital

01:26.640 --> 01:27.640
issue.

01:27.640 --> 01:32.640
Here to do this political argument for Washington Spotlight, our Senator Esteskeet

01:32.640 --> 01:38.800
over, who has won more Democratic delegates than any other Democratic candidate, and Senator

01:38.800 --> 01:44.040
Richard Nixon of California, one of the dynamic younger leaders of the Republican Party.

01:44.040 --> 01:50.640
But before we hear this political argument, here is a message of special interest.

01:50.640 --> 02:03.440
Now we'll hear from the first of our two special guests, Senator Keith Oliver.

02:03.440 --> 02:08.560
Senator Keith, Oliver, you have approximately a minute to state your point of view.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.800
How do not think that the American people are going to entrust the Republican Party with

02:12.800 --> 02:15.480
the control of the country for the next four years?

02:16.200 --> 02:20.480
For the reason that while there are some progressives in some international-minded people in the

02:20.480 --> 02:26.920
Republican Party, still the dominant part of our Republican Party unfortunately is the

02:26.920 --> 02:33.200
same old reactionary group that fought all of the social and economic gains such as housing,

02:33.200 --> 02:39.560
social security, laws for the benefit of the working men and women, the farmer, and

02:39.560 --> 02:44.200
many other progressive measures that we have made during the past 20 years.

02:44.200 --> 02:49.000
Also we tried the Republican Party one time on the issue of war or peace, and they let

02:49.000 --> 02:51.800
us down the road of isolationism.

02:51.800 --> 02:57.640
The same group would be in power again if we should have a change in administration.

02:57.640 --> 03:03.160
And I think the American people want to have a party on a program such as we, if the

03:03.160 --> 03:07.920
Democratic Party, have that will give us an opportunity of having something better than

03:07.920 --> 03:09.920
wars ever-generation.

03:09.920 --> 03:14.560
These Republicans being divided as they are cannot be trusted to do that.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.240
Thank you, Senator Keapoffer, and now Senator Nixon, you have the same thought.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.640
Well, it is because we have had wars ever-generation that I believe that the American people will

03:22.640 --> 03:26.240
elect a Republican administration this November.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.920
I believe that there are in the Democratic Party those who feel that they could give the

03:30.920 --> 03:34.120
new leadership that the nation wants and needs.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.960
People like Senator Keapoffer.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.120
But I am also convinced that Senator Keapoffer and others who would like to give that new

03:40.120 --> 03:44.920
leadership are not going to be able to give it because they will be tied to the policies

03:44.920 --> 03:46.960
of the Democratic machine.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.880
And over the past seven years, we have found that the Democratic Party through its administration

03:51.880 --> 03:56.360
has failed to meet the great issue of our time, the survival of the nation.

03:56.360 --> 04:00.720
In that period, we have lost 600 million people to the communists without the Russians

04:00.720 --> 04:03.280
losing a single soldier in combat.

04:03.280 --> 04:07.880
And because America needs new leadership, because the Democratic Party can't furnish

04:07.880 --> 04:12.400
that new leadership, and because I believe that the Republican Party can furnish that

04:12.400 --> 04:17.200
leadership, I believe that the American people are going to elect a new administration

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
this November.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
Thank you, Senator Nixon.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.200
Well, hello, Mr. President.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.200
I appreciate it.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
I appreciate it.

04:22.200 --> 04:27.400
Senator Nixon's little personal remark about me and that's very gracious of him.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.320
So typical of his good people in California who have been very good to me in a recent election

04:32.320 --> 04:34.120
that I participated in out there.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.920
But shall we talk about foreign policy a few minutes?

04:36.920 --> 04:37.920
Do you think that will be the issue?

04:37.920 --> 04:38.920
I'd like to ask you.

04:38.920 --> 04:39.920
Yes, I agree.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.360
And I'm perfectly willing to fund out a major issue, but also we have domestic issues,

04:45.360 --> 04:47.680
and so maybe we can discuss them both.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.800
But I would suggest that the domestic issues are pretty closely related to the foreign policy

04:51.800 --> 04:52.800
issues.

04:52.800 --> 04:57.040
And that therefore I'd perfectly willing to make foreign policy the issue of this discussion

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
today.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.280
Well, I don't blame you because the program of the Republican Party is so dismal on domestic

05:02.280 --> 05:03.280
issues.

05:03.280 --> 05:10.160
I should think that all of you want to get away from it, but let's take a foreign policy.

05:10.160 --> 05:16.520
As I see it, Mr. Charles, we must support and sustain the United Nations.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.720
I think that we have given strength to the United Nations by putting our foot down in

05:20.720 --> 05:25.200
Korea, letting the Communists know that we are not going to go on a series, that they're

05:25.200 --> 05:27.920
not going on a series of aggressions.

05:27.920 --> 05:33.360
I think the North Atlantic and Western Europe that we are stronger today, better able to

05:33.360 --> 05:36.520
resist communist aggression than before.

05:36.520 --> 05:42.560
And I think that our point for program is a very important matter in the building for

05:42.560 --> 05:44.640
peace throughout the world.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.880
These other things are more or less holding actions.

05:47.880 --> 05:52.600
But our point for program is a program that will convince, I think, neutral people and

05:52.600 --> 05:56.320
neutral nations that their best opportunities with us.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.840
We have taken the lead in these programs.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.280
Senator Taft, other Republicans have fought them.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.040
We don't know what the Republican Party would do.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.240
I would like to hear Senator Taft cut out.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.040
Especially about Korea.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.040
Yes.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.640
We've had the discussion about the programs.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.560
We've had discussion about the fact that the Republicans have opposed some of the programs,

06:13.560 --> 06:18.760
although Senator Keith offer has admitted, of course, that some Republicans have supported

06:18.760 --> 06:21.680
some of these programs that he feels like he should be about Senator Taft.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.680
That's correct.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.680
But the point you should be made.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.680
That's not a part of it, though.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.160
That's a point that should be made as this.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.720
And I think this is important.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.560
We've got to look at the overall program.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.720
Not one little isolated part of it, the case of point four, the fact that the decision

06:33.720 --> 06:38.760
to go into Korea in the first instance was correct, provided we were prepared to do what

06:38.760 --> 06:40.880
was necessary to carry forth that decision.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.480
And of course, we were not at that time.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.440
But the point that I wish to make is this.

06:45.440 --> 06:50.680
It seems to me that our foreign policy over the past seven years of the Truman administration,

06:50.680 --> 06:55.120
a policy which will be continued, which will be continued under Senator Keith offer if

06:55.120 --> 06:59.280
he becomes president or Mr. Hariman or any other of the Democratic candidates, that

06:59.280 --> 07:02.320
that policy has been tried and found wanting.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.800
Because I come back to this point again and again.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.200
In those seven years, we lost 600 million people to the Communist.

07:08.200 --> 07:13.120
And at the end of six years of that period, we were involved in the Korean War, a war

07:13.120 --> 07:17.440
which has lost us already over 115,000 American casualties.

07:17.440 --> 07:22.240
But now I say regardless of what the policy has been, that that policy isn't good enough.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.520
We need a better one.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.360
And you've already, I think, pointed out that you support the policies of the past.

07:28.360 --> 07:32.680
You haven't indicated that you have any, for example, disagreement with Secretary Atchison,

07:32.680 --> 07:34.560
or others who have made those policies.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.360
I for one believe that we need a new debt.

07:37.360 --> 07:41.480
We need a new leadership, a new leadership, a new policy which will avoid the errors of

07:41.480 --> 07:46.060
the past, retain those parts of the policies in the past that are proved successful and abandon

07:46.060 --> 07:47.060
those that have failed.

07:47.200 --> 07:52.500
I would like to hear your comment on that loss of 600 million people too.

07:52.500 --> 07:57.660
Of course, the whole thing is that we haven't lost Western Europe.

07:57.660 --> 08:02.260
We still do have areas of strength, then the far east.

08:02.260 --> 08:05.420
We have at least laid some headway in the near east.

08:05.420 --> 08:10.900
But if we had followed the Republican policy, as exemplified by the Senate leaders, we wouldn't

08:10.900 --> 08:13.940
have had the not-Atlantic pack.

08:13.940 --> 08:17.380
We wouldn't have had the .4 program.

08:17.380 --> 08:20.900
We probably were instead of losing 600 million people.

08:20.900 --> 08:27.220
We would have lost the arsenal of Western Europe and many other parts of India.

08:27.220 --> 08:31.180
So that we at least have held our own and many parts of the world.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.020
We're building up our strength.

08:33.020 --> 08:35.300
And I think we're building much good will.

08:35.300 --> 08:41.620
UK, go by what we have lost because if the Republicans had been in control, I'm certain

08:41.620 --> 08:43.260
we would have lost a great deal more.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.740
Well, that's a very interesting argument.

08:44.740 --> 08:49.820
I can admit that if I were on the other side, I might say that if the other party had been

08:49.820 --> 08:53.460
in control that the policy would have failed even worse than it had.

08:53.460 --> 08:57.040
But the point that I get back to time and again is that we've had this administration in

08:57.040 --> 08:58.700
power for seven years.

08:58.700 --> 09:02.460
During that seven years, we did lose the 600 million people.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.460
And the fact that some segments of the policy have been successful.

09:05.460 --> 09:09.100
And I agree with you that our policy in Europe to an extent has been successful.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.100
I say that isn't good enough.

09:11.100 --> 09:15.660
We need a policy which will get the United States on the offensive throughout the world,

09:15.660 --> 09:18.420
which will get back some of these 600 million people.

09:18.420 --> 09:22.020
And I don't feel that our present leadership in this state department, which Senator

09:22.020 --> 09:25.580
Keith Orfer would have to continue in power and probably would.

09:25.580 --> 09:29.900
At least as far as their policies are concerned, if he were even selected the presidency, I do

09:29.900 --> 09:34.620
not believe that our present leadership will give the new dynamic leadership which is

09:34.620 --> 09:38.220
needed to reverse this trend which is leading us down the road to disaster.

09:38.220 --> 09:41.060
This child's, if I had my way about it, I'd put more

09:41.060 --> 09:49.300
stress on the point for program also on the economic assistance rather than military assistance.

09:49.300 --> 09:53.780
Because I think those are the ways that we can build for peace.

09:53.780 --> 09:55.580
We have done something in Western Europe.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.820
We have tried to do something in Asia.

09:57.820 --> 09:59.820
We have made the United Nations work.

09:59.820 --> 10:04.580
Now Senator Nixon says that if his party had been in power, that they would have done

10:04.580 --> 10:05.580
something different.

10:05.580 --> 10:09.620
Well, all I hear about his party is that they wouldn't do anything at all.

10:09.620 --> 10:13.220
They would do it less expensively than we have done.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.940
That's about the only program that I've heard the Republican Spring call.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.900
I'd like to ask both of you that on my question.

10:17.900 --> 10:23.140
Would you, Senator Keith Orfer, first end the war in Korea by extending the war further

10:23.140 --> 10:25.740
across the other world into China?

10:25.740 --> 10:29.660
I don't think we want to extend the war in Korea further.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.900
We of course want to bring it to a termination.

10:32.900 --> 10:37.220
I think the matter of the repeat creation of prisoners of war ought to be referred to the

10:37.220 --> 10:42.300
general assembly of the United Nations where it can have a broader basis for discussion

10:42.300 --> 10:43.420
and let them decide it.

10:43.420 --> 10:44.820
But we don't want to extend the war.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.620
I'd like to answer that point.

10:46.620 --> 10:51.260
Senator Keith Orfer has suggested that the problem of repatriation of prisoners be presented

10:51.260 --> 10:54.860
to the United Nations so that they can have a broader basis for discussion and decide

10:54.860 --> 10:55.860
the problem.

10:55.860 --> 11:00.140
I for one, and I state this as my position and I would hope it would be the Republican

11:00.140 --> 11:06.820
position, would never agree to any United Nations decision which would require thousands

11:06.820 --> 11:12.660
of prisoners who have come over to the American lines and to the United Nations lines on

11:12.660 --> 11:16.540
the promise that they would not have to be repatriated if they did not want to do so that

11:16.540 --> 11:18.460
would require them to go back to their death.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.820
We would lose the cause of moral leadership in the world.

11:21.820 --> 11:25.640
And I, frankly, want to make my position clear on that point and I don't think Senator

11:25.640 --> 11:29.420
Keith Orfer would agree with that if he would think that thing through.

11:29.420 --> 11:34.980
Well, I don't want to take the communist point of view about the repatriation of prisoners

11:34.980 --> 11:37.140
making people go back against their will.

11:37.140 --> 11:43.420
But after all, we are in Korea under mandate of the United Nations, the General Assembly.

11:43.420 --> 11:48.620
I think it's the problem of the General Assembly to bring in points of view and try to reach

11:48.620 --> 11:50.140
a settlement of this problem.

11:50.140 --> 11:53.860
But of course, if we follow Senator Ted, in other's point of view, we'd get out of Korea

11:53.860 --> 11:54.860
entirely.

11:54.860 --> 11:55.860
So I'd interrupt you.

11:55.860 --> 12:00.780
Thank you, Senator Keith Orfer, and you, Senator Nixon, for a most interesting discussion.

12:00.780 --> 12:05.580
Now before we hear about next week's guests and our subject, here is a message of interest.

12:05.580 --> 12:11.260
We hope you've enjoyed this edition of Washington Spotlight, and that you'll be with us again

12:11.260 --> 12:12.260
next week.

12:12.260 --> 12:16.860
When our question will be, should the President have the power to seize industry?

12:16.860 --> 12:21.860
And one of our guests will be Senator Wayne Morse, Republican of Oregon.

12:21.860 --> 12:25.900
Until then, this is Mark with Childs, signing off for Washington Spotlight.
