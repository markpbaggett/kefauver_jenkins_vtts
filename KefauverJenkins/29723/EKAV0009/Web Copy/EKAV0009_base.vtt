00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the Senate Appropriations Committee has just

00:09.440 --> 00:11.520
reported out the Public Works Bill.

00:11.520 --> 00:15.680
I've had the privilege as a member of the full committee and a member of the Public Works

00:15.680 --> 00:21.480
Subcommittee, of working for several projects of great interest to our state, from the first

00:21.480 --> 00:24.280
time they came up for consideration.

00:24.280 --> 00:29.320
In the case of one project, the Melton Hill Dam, we were able to have added to the final

00:29.320 --> 00:34.360
bill one million dollars, which will mean that construction on this much-needed dam can

00:34.360 --> 00:36.360
begin next year.

00:36.360 --> 00:41.800
The Melton Hill Dam will be a multipurpose dam providing means of manufacturing hydroelectric

00:41.800 --> 00:45.600
power, flood control and navigation.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.720
General Vogel, the Chairman of the TVA Board, testified before the subcommittee that a power

00:50.720 --> 00:55.400
shortage is expected during the winter of 1962-63.

00:56.240 --> 01:02.480
Well, since the Melton Hill Dam will be located close to the principal user of TVA power,

01:02.480 --> 01:05.320
the Atomic Energy Commission at Oak Ridge.

01:05.320 --> 01:10.160
Its completion just subsequent to that time will grow a long way, total alleviating a potential

01:10.160 --> 01:13.760
weak spot in our national defense.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.840
The project will provide navigation on the clinch river, a tributary of the Tennessee

01:17.840 --> 01:19.640
up to Clinton.

01:19.640 --> 01:25.240
The waters impounded by the Melton Hill Dam will provide new recreational areas for several

01:25.240 --> 01:32.600
hundred thousand persons and the immediate vicinity which includes the city of Knoxville.

01:32.600 --> 01:37.080
In addition, the employment picture in this area will be improved tremendously through

01:37.080 --> 01:41.200
the jobs provided by this project construction.

01:41.200 --> 01:46.880
For the Melton Hill Dam, $200,000 for planning was also included in the appropriation bill.

01:46.880 --> 01:54.880
An item of great interest to those in the Carthage and on the Cumberland River section is $200,000

01:54.880 --> 02:00.520
of new design and engineering money provided for the Cordell Hold Dam.

02:00.520 --> 02:07.400
This money will be used to design navigational locks in this dam which will be built at Carthage.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.880
At another location on the Cumberland River, the $19 million budgeted for the Barclay

02:12.880 --> 02:14.840
Dam was retained by our committee.

02:14.840 --> 02:20.240
While this dam is actually in Kentucky, the waters that impounds will back up well into

02:20.240 --> 02:25.920
Tennessee and provide miles and miles of recreational shoreline and will be important for

02:25.920 --> 02:27.680
navigation.

02:27.680 --> 02:32.200
Looking now to West Tennessee, I'm delighted to be able to report that a total of a half

02:32.200 --> 02:37.040
a million dollars has been provided for flood works and drainage works in this part of

02:37.040 --> 02:38.560
our state.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.320
At Memphis, the Wolf River has been a real problem for many years, flooding and making useless

02:43.320 --> 02:49.040
much good, bottom, farm land and Shelby County for long periods of each year.

02:49.040 --> 02:54.480
About $300,000 has been provided in the bill toward correcting the situation.

02:54.480 --> 02:59.480
What money will be used for engineering to begin the actual work of cutting a new channel

02:59.480 --> 03:05.120
through the Wolf River, far the Wolf River, to the Mississippi River at North Memphis.

03:05.120 --> 03:09.200
Some of this money will also be used for cleaning out the Wolf's Channel Eastward from where

03:09.200 --> 03:11.600
this new channel will be built.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.920
I know the residents of North Memphis and Frazier not to mention those downtown methians

03:15.920 --> 03:21.600
who work downtown will be glad to know that this project will eventually do much to eliminate

03:21.600 --> 03:27.400
the unpleasant odors for which the Wolf has been, sometimes been famous.

03:27.400 --> 03:33.560
And last but not least, certainly not least, I am pleased to report that $200,000 has been

03:33.560 --> 03:37.400
included for the West Tennessee drainage district.

03:37.400 --> 03:42.720
This money will be used to start work on clearing and channel straightening on the Forkard

03:42.720 --> 03:44.920
deer and O'Brien rivers.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.400
This has been a long needed undertake, undertaking.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.280
Thousands of acres of good farm land have been rendered useless or damaged by the floods

03:52.280 --> 03:55.400
on these tributaries of the Mississippi River.

03:55.400 --> 04:00.600
Highways and roads have been completely blocked many times during high water periods.

04:00.600 --> 04:07.360
But it's sum up about $1,000,000 of new monies for these vital Tennessee projects has been

04:07.360 --> 04:11.360
included in the Senate appropriations bill for public works.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.760
These projects will be of great value to the areas which they serve.

04:15.760 --> 04:21.280
And working on these projects, my colleague Senator Gore and I worked together, Melton

04:21.280 --> 04:26.440
Hill Dam is in the District of Congressman Baker and he has certainly been very active.

04:26.440 --> 04:32.040
The Cordeaux Hall of Am is in Congressman Joe Evans District and he has on the appropriations

04:32.040 --> 04:33.840
committee has done much for it.

04:33.840 --> 04:38.840
The West Tennessee drainage district is in Congressman Everett's and the Wolf Harbor District

04:38.840 --> 04:41.080
is in Congressman Davis.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.880
They have all worked very hard for these projects.

04:43.880 --> 04:48.080
Thank you and goodbye in the next week.

04:48.080 --> 04:58.680
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we in Hamilton County and in Chattanooga are

04:58.680 --> 05:04.320
mighty proud of our county and of our city and they were very fine governments we have,

05:04.320 --> 05:08.640
they very fine progress that we are making in the city of Chattanooga.

05:08.640 --> 05:14.200
We have the honor today of having with us two of our outstanding public officials in

05:14.200 --> 05:19.840
the city of Chattanooga are very great mayor Rudy O'Juddy who is here with the Commissioner

05:19.840 --> 05:25.360
of Macon Turf to see about some important business affecting the people of Chattanooga.

05:25.360 --> 05:33.200
Rudy, will you tell us briefly what took place in Washington and what we were here for?

05:33.200 --> 05:39.360
Sector, we first want to say that we appreciate the courage that you've shown us and to take

05:39.360 --> 05:43.600
out of your business schedule the time to make the appointments that you have made and we

05:43.600 --> 05:49.900
we've been up here primarily interested in the disposition of the volunteer ordinance

05:49.900 --> 05:54.040
plan and the cramet properties that's on the federal government there.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.320
That's causing us a lot of concern for an employment standpoint.

05:59.040 --> 06:05.080
That's right and we did get the agreements that they would survey the situation try to find some use

06:05.080 --> 06:13.280
and perhaps turn some of it over to local authorities for industrial sites in the event it was possible to do so.

06:13.280 --> 06:19.320
Well, good to have you here at Commissioner George Macon Turf and thank you Senator.

06:19.320 --> 06:24.320
It's always good to come to Washington and enjoy your hospitality.

06:24.320 --> 06:32.320
We appreciate the efforts that you have made on behalf of the citizens of Hamilton County and Chattanooga

06:32.320 --> 06:37.320
and we feel that something good will come from this visit here today.

06:37.320 --> 06:44.320
Well, I think so too and of course all of us who live in Chattanooga know of the remarkable developments that are taking place there.

06:44.320 --> 06:50.920
They are far seeing programs inaugurated by these gentlemen but we want the people in the other part of the state

06:50.920 --> 06:53.920
who may be viewing this program to know something about it.

06:53.920 --> 06:58.920
So, Mayor O'Donnell, if you tell us about some of the things that are taking place in Chattanooga now,

06:58.920 --> 07:00.920
let's talk about the highway program first.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.920
We have a great highway program in the city of Chattanooga in an air state system.

07:04.920 --> 07:11.920
We, the Teddy of Truth across the board, we have a hundred million dollar public works program which is highways,

07:11.920 --> 07:17.920
airports, schools, fire protection, sewers and all the things that go along with it.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.920
Railroad relocation and urban renewal and we made a lot of progress.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.920
We have three contracts just about completed. One is completed.

07:25.920 --> 07:31.920
The contract led for two more just this month and we're making good progress in our highway program.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.920
Well, it certainly is evident to see when you go there. Do you want to add anything to that commission to make?

07:35.920 --> 07:38.920
Well, I want to say a word about our urban renewal program.

07:38.920 --> 07:46.920
We're taking a section of Chattanooga composed of more than 400 acres and redeveloping the entire area

07:46.920 --> 07:50.920
and it's going to insert new life into downtown Chattanooga.

07:50.920 --> 08:00.920
It's a very progressive program and we're getting the full cooperation of the entire city in this urban renewal program.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.920
It's going to revitalize downtown Chattanooga.

08:03.920 --> 08:11.920
Well, I agree with you. This urban renewal is one of the best projects of the federal, state and local governments can do together.

08:11.920 --> 08:18.920
Well, Mayor Ojady, I tell us about the airport program. You've done a whole lot with the airport down there.

08:18.920 --> 08:26.920
We have a fine airport Chattanooga but it's like every other airport in the country we have in more air travel and that means more expansion

08:26.920 --> 08:32.920
and we do have a two and a half million dollar expansion program contemplated for our airport.

08:32.920 --> 08:38.920
Well, you've tried to get an appropriation for the federal government to assist in certain areas needed isn't it commission?

08:38.920 --> 08:47.920
It surely is. In Senator, we're concerned about the TBA CF financing bill which just recently passed the same bill.

08:47.920 --> 08:56.920
Well, we all are because Chattanooga is the center of a lot of the TBA activities and we're happy to report the bill passed the Senate in acceptable form.

08:56.920 --> 09:02.920
Not as good as we would like and the House will probably agree to the Senate amendments and will go on to the press to...

09:03.920 --> 09:12.920
I certainly hope the President is going to sign the bill. Well, Mayor Ojady, you want to add anything about the TBA program or the highway program?

09:12.920 --> 09:22.920
Well, we're happy that you've gotten us far along with the TBA CF financing bill as you have and we hope it goes on to the President's signature.

09:22.920 --> 09:28.920
And this highway program, of course the financing has been concerned us very much. I think it's just the mud us that we're going to find.

09:28.920 --> 09:37.920
I agree with you. I'm sorry gentlemen. Thank you very much, Mayor Ojady and Commissioner Mackinter. Until next week, goodbye.

09:38.920 --> 09:56.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee. I'm a very flattered and honored to have one of my best friends in the Senate with us today.

09:56.920 --> 10:06.920
He's a very popular and able member of the United States Senate from the second largest state in the Union, the state of Texas, Ralph Yarborough.

10:06.920 --> 10:11.920
And thank you very much Ralph for coming and being with me on this program.

10:11.920 --> 10:20.920
Senator Keep offer, thank you for this invitation. This is a real honor to be on this program. More people came to Texas from Tennessee than for many other states.

10:20.920 --> 10:30.920
My grandfather was born in that great volunteer state and of course you represented the Democratic Party in all the states of the Union and we're grateful for the help you've given us in Texas.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.920
Would you speak to us for the Democratic Party?

10:32.920 --> 10:38.920
Well, that's my nice, we're proud of all the Texans who came from Tennessee.

10:38.920 --> 10:44.920
I know that your grandfather was born up in Cumberland County, I think, and lived up there, didn't he Ralph?

10:44.920 --> 10:49.920
Right up somewhere in the northern part, the central part of it, northern Tennessee.

10:49.920 --> 11:09.920
Well, I had the pleasure of being a co-sponsor of a bill that Senator Yarborough took the leadership in and worked through the committee and passed on the floor of the Senate this week, a very important bill called the Cool War GI Bill of Rights.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.920
And I want you to explain about the bill, will you?

11:13.920 --> 11:23.920
First, Senator Keep, offer, thank you for being a co-sponsor and adding your influence and making that very able argument for the bill on the floor of the Senate to help so much in the passage.

11:23.920 --> 11:30.920
This bill is to continue the, basically, the benefits of the Korean War Bill to the veterans of the Cold War.

11:30.920 --> 11:36.920
That is the period since January 1955 until the draft ends in 1963.

11:36.920 --> 11:49.920
And it provides for educational and vocational educational opportunities for these veterans for loans on homes and farms, but it does not have mustering out pay and does not have business loans.

11:49.920 --> 11:53.920
A lot of the veterans organizations felt it shouldn't be as broad as the conflict period.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.920
It's not as broad, but it does carry the educational opportunities.

11:57.920 --> 12:04.920
Well, I think the GI Bill of Rights was one of the best pieces of legislation that Congress passed.

12:04.920 --> 12:16.920
And Tennessee had more than 200,000 young men and women took advantage of it, getting education, also buying a home and buying a farm.

12:16.920 --> 12:23.920
And this extends some of the benefits to those who are serving since 1955, isn't that correct?

12:23.920 --> 12:30.920
As long as they draft runs till 1963, they'll have an opportunity to go to college where they've been in service.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.920
And that's 45% of the young men who are better in this.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.920
How many would be eligible for benefits on this bill?

12:36.920 --> 12:40.920
Four million will be eligible about half will take them.

12:40.920 --> 12:46.920
The experience of World War II and the Korean conflict is that only 50% of the veterans go to school under the bills.

12:46.920 --> 12:52.920
Four million will be eligible. We should have two million more and will raise the educational level of our people with their loans.

12:52.920 --> 12:58.920
I think that about 93,000 will be eligible in the state of Tennessee under this new program.

12:58.920 --> 13:02.920
And I know it'll mean a whole lot to these young men.

13:02.920 --> 13:07.920
Now, Senator Long had an amendment which was adopted to your bill, Senator Yarbal.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.920
Will you tell what that was?

13:09.920 --> 13:13.920
Well, the opposition to the Democratic Party wanted to make this wholly alone program.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.920
Senator Long had a compromised proposal.

13:16.920 --> 13:22.920
At the sub-college level, high school and vocational education is still a grant.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.920
The first year in college will be a grant program.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.920
But if the student falls in the bottom 50% of his class, then it'll have to borrow money.

13:29.920 --> 13:36.920
But if it can raise this grades as long as it stays in the top 50% of his class in college, it will be a grant by the government.

13:36.920 --> 13:45.920
And as I understand this would last for three years as a maximum amount that anybody can get on to the program.

13:45.920 --> 13:53.920
That's correct, Senator. If you keep all of your kids to school, they're in a half-each-day of service, but not over three years of education.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.920
Now, how about the home and farm alone provisions of the bill?

13:57.920 --> 14:09.920
That is to permit them to make direct loans just like the Korean and the World War II veterans to have a direct loan for home or farm, particularly helpful in the rural areas that are sold in the credit for farm homes.

14:09.920 --> 14:19.920
Now, Senator Yarbrough, I want to congratulate you upon the leadership you have finished in presenting this bill and getting it passed in the Senate and certainly good to have you with us.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.920
Thank you for this, I saw. And I'll make sure you help.

14:22.920 --> 14:41.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the most serious economic problem facing our nation today is the deadlock between labor and management in the steel industry.

14:41.920 --> 14:46.920
Negotiations, mediation and fact-finding swim around before the public's eye.

14:46.920 --> 14:52.920
In full-page advertisements placed by labor and management, each argues that the other is wrong.

14:52.920 --> 14:57.920
In the midst of this impasse, the public interests flounders and the consumer wonders.

14:57.920 --> 15:03.920
When the smoke is cleared away, well, John Cue public's pocketbook stagger under another blow.

15:03.920 --> 15:15.920
Where the price of paper clips and pots and pans and pumps and pyromores, and everything else, John Cue must buy, clam another rum on the ladder of inflation when the sound and fury have subsided.

15:16.920 --> 15:24.920
Well, why are big steel and the steel workers locked in this gigantic wrestling match, each with an identical hammer lock on the other?

15:24.920 --> 15:30.920
What are the conflicting positions of labor and management, which have produced this desperate draw?

15:30.920 --> 15:38.920
Management rests this case essentially on the assumption that the time has come to hold what it calls inflationary wage increases.

15:38.920 --> 15:44.920
Management also says that it must have higher profits in order to finance the future expansion of the industry.

15:45.920 --> 15:57.920
Labor bases its case largely upon the assumption that the steel companies can easily afford to grant a wage boost without incurring an increase in cost, because of the increase in labor productivity.

15:57.920 --> 16:03.920
Labor also believes profits of the steel companies are excessive and wants to share in these profits.

16:03.920 --> 16:08.920
Labor and management both insist that they have the consumers' interest at heart.

16:08.920 --> 16:16.920
Well, many facts have been produced from the series of administered price hearings before the antitrust and monopoly subcommittee of which I am chairman.

16:16.920 --> 16:26.920
This past week, one of the newest facts to reach the public came in the announcement by the steel companies themselves of their profits for the first half of this year.

16:26.920 --> 16:37.920
Profits after taxes for 14 companies accounting for three-fifths of the industry's capacity, jumped 145 percent over the first half of last year.

16:37.920 --> 16:46.920
The industry leader, United States Steel Corporation, was 28 percent of our steel making capacity, neted $255 million.

16:46.920 --> 16:51.920
This is 88 percent more than the US steel netted for the same period last year.

16:51.920 --> 16:56.920
Well, friends, we are face to face today with a fundamental problem in the steel industry.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.920
In the future, this problem is going to confront us in other industries.

17:00.920 --> 17:08.920
Our public policy always has been toward industry in the past, has been based on the theory of price competition.

17:08.920 --> 17:17.920
If any firm in a competitive industry makes an improvement which reduces its cost, it is assumed that it will reduce its prices accordingly.

17:17.920 --> 17:24.920
The other firms will have to make the improvement themselves or lose the business to the firm which made the improvement.

17:24.920 --> 17:35.920
The pioneering company gains increased business at least for a time, while the consumer receives the benefit of the innovation in the form of lower prices.

17:35.920 --> 17:41.920
But where there is no real price competition as in the steel industry, he just can't apply this theory.

17:41.920 --> 17:52.920
The problem we face today in non-competitive price industries is how to affect an equitable distribution of productivity gains made possible by scientific progress.

17:53.920 --> 17:59.920
Labor claims these gains, it argues that labor is being displaced by technological progress.

17:59.920 --> 18:09.920
Management bases its claims on the need for installation of new and better machinery and equipment, and it argues that greater profits are required for this.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.920
But the consumer has a claim too.

18:11.920 --> 18:20.920
John Cue Public argues that there is no purpose to scientific progress unless it results ultimately in lower prices or better products.

18:20.920 --> 18:31.920
While translating this into the context of the present steel controversy, I believe the consumer should continue to be the principal beneficiary of technological progress.

18:31.920 --> 18:49.920
I believe there is ample room without undue reduction in profits for price reduction and steel, together with a small increase in wages, preferably in the form of an increase in pensions, which would give greater time to enjoy life to the older workers and greater opportunity to the younger ones.

18:50.920 --> 19:04.920
Until this problem is faced with a nation and by all divisions of our government, I am afraid the wage-price spiral will keep spinning higher and higher, and the value of John Cue Public's dollar will plunge lower and lower, but I hope this is not going to be the case.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.920
Thank you until next week at this time.

19:08.920 --> 19:32.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, without a doubt the most important development in Washington and in the world is the decision of President Eisenhower in Premier Nikita Kruciak to exchange visits in September and this fall.

19:33.920 --> 19:51.920
When this was announced that precipitated a flood of speculation all the way from full approval of the idea to outright opposition and indignation, some feel that this country is letting down the people of the free nations who have sided with us against the threat of communism.

19:51.920 --> 20:04.920
Some other people argue that people in the captive nations behind the Iron Curtain will feel that they have been abandoned and forgotten about with this new show of friendship.

20:04.920 --> 20:12.920
There is also concern that some incident might happen to Mr. Kruciak when he was here that would make tensions worse rather than easing them.

20:12.920 --> 20:20.920
We are all fully aware of these viewpoints, but I have faith in the sound, common sense, and judgment of our people.

20:20.920 --> 20:26.920
I do not think that Mr. Kruciak's visit to this country will pull the eyes over any of our people.

20:26.920 --> 20:43.920
I do think that this is a chance to show Mr. Kruciak the prosperity and the strength of America and that it might give him a second to so bring thought that he is laboring under any idea about our material strength or our spiritual stamina.

20:44.920 --> 20:51.920
I think that people of all nations of the world are acutely concerned with a nuclear threat that hangs over our heads.

20:51.920 --> 20:58.920
Our nation will spend more than $40 billion this year for missiles, for defense, for powder and for guns.

20:58.920 --> 21:03.920
We simply cannot go on with this kind of military expenditure.

21:03.920 --> 21:12.920
We would like to use some of this money for other and good social things, hospitals, schools, and things that our people need.

21:12.920 --> 21:22.920
The Cold War requires Russia to divert tremendous outlays from its economic development into support of its large military commitments.

21:22.920 --> 21:32.920
The vision of destruction and death that a nuclear attack and counterattack would mean is a sober and terrifying one.

21:32.920 --> 21:41.920
The cold hard fact is that there is no alternative to peace, and this becomes more an indescapable conclusion every day.

21:42.920 --> 21:52.920
Any avenue that can turn Premier Kruciak and the world away from a deadly march toward war is an avenue that we must and that we ought to explore.

21:52.920 --> 22:09.920
His visit to the United States and President Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union is maybe one of these ways to turn the thoughts of the people of the world to other avenues and is one that ought to be explored.

22:09.920 --> 22:16.920
You will note that the President intends to visit with the leaders of Western Europe before he goes to Moscow.

22:16.920 --> 22:26.920
And I think this is good. They naturally have a great many anxieties that some agreement might be made that would bind them, if they were not advised of.

22:26.920 --> 22:35.920
And of course any major policy decision must be made in conjunction with our loyal allies of the West.

22:36.920 --> 22:48.920
After all this is a new course for the United States and for the world, and it should be explained to our allies and to the friends that we have in the non-committed nations of the world before in this step is taken.

22:48.920 --> 22:55.920
And no great settlement I don't think is going to come from the exchange of visits of President Eisenhower and Mr. Kruciak.

22:55.920 --> 23:01.920
Such cannot result in independent action without the participation of our allies.

23:01.920 --> 23:13.920
But if nothing more results than the easing of tension and the relaxation of difficulties generated over the Berlin crisis, certainly we can say that some progress has been made.

23:13.920 --> 23:18.920
As long as we are talking, we are not fighting and we are not dying.

23:18.920 --> 23:28.920
And so I welcome the opportunity our people now have of showing Mr. Kruciak our wonderful country and what we have here in the United States.

23:29.920 --> 23:44.920
And I have suggested to the President that Mr. Kruciak's list of American visits include the Tennessee Valley Authority region, where he will see a fine example of democracy and action and I know personally that he is interested.

23:44.920 --> 23:53.920
Also that he goes to Nashville and see the state capital and here the Grand Ole Opry and visit the Permitage. That's all for now. Thank you very much.

23:59.920 --> 24:00.920
Thank you.

24:15.920 --> 24:22.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, there's good news from Washington today and also a little of the other variety.

24:22.920 --> 24:29.920
On the bright side, the Tennessee Valley Authority won the right to self finance some long needed new generating facilities.

24:29.920 --> 24:36.920
The victory came after a lengthy legislative battle between friends of TBA and its private power enemies.

24:36.920 --> 24:41.920
The self-financing bill, as you know, was approved last month by both the House and the Senate.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.920
It then was sent to President Eisenhower for his approval or veto.

24:45.920 --> 24:57.920
Many persons predicted the President would veto the bill, but the President finally agreed to sign the measure on the assurance of congressional leaders that a clarifying amendment on executive authority would be passed.

24:57.920 --> 25:09.920
It was a great day for the Valley when the bill was signed into the law and I might add a great day for all members of Congress from Tennessee and other states who have worked so diligently for its passage.

25:09.920 --> 25:18.920
Under the new statute, the TBA Board has a media authority to issue up to $750 million worth of revenue bonds for expansion purposes.

25:18.920 --> 25:22.920
Why is that so important? Let me take a moment to explain.

25:22.920 --> 25:29.920
History is steep with tragic examples of national decline because of soil, forest, or water misuse.

25:29.920 --> 25:37.920
The great Tennessee Valley might have become another tragic example, if the TBA had not been created in 1953.

25:38.920 --> 25:45.920
Prior to the TBA, the great rivers of the Valley were languid in one season, but wild and destructive in another.

25:45.920 --> 25:53.920
In those days, the soils of the Valley were severely depleted. The average income of our people was only 44% of the national average.

25:53.920 --> 26:02.920
It's mattering of industry was just about all we had. Prior to the TBA, only 3% of our rural homes were electrified.

26:02.920 --> 26:10.920
Indeed, the Valley, 25 years ago, presented a fairly typical picture of an economically underdeveloped area.

26:10.920 --> 26:19.920
I need not explain to you the benefits of TBA. Our farms are now electrified up to 97%. Farm living knives is modern as urban living.

26:19.920 --> 26:24.920
Farm incomes have increased through the use of our TBA electrical service.

26:24.920 --> 26:30.920
Our industrial program in Tennessee has moved briskly ahead because we have ample, low cost power.

26:30.920 --> 26:38.920
At the same time, the TBA has opened up great recreational areas. Our state has become a major tourist attraction.

26:38.920 --> 26:48.920
Nevertheless, officials of the TBA for the past several years are warned of a possible powered shortage, as more and more electricity was demanded for our whole man for industry.

26:48.920 --> 26:56.920
They pointed out that more generating facilities would be required soon. Our progress in the Valley would be severely restricted.

26:56.920 --> 27:05.920
Electricity cannot be stockpiled like most products. It is, you can't stack cans of electricity in a warehouse like bales of cotton or sacks of sugar.

27:05.920 --> 27:11.920
Electricity has to flow from distribution areas immediately to the farm or the home or the industry.

27:11.920 --> 27:18.920
Quite obviously there must be an ample generating capacity or someone somewhere along the electric land will not get what he wants.

27:18.920 --> 27:23.920
More than that, it takes about three years to build a new generating steam plant.

27:23.920 --> 27:35.920
So, TBA asked the Congress for authority to borrow money. This money, accidentally, will be repaid by the TBA with interest, just the same as if a businessman goes down the street and borrow money from his local bank.

27:35.920 --> 27:45.920
In other words, the government is not at one cent. Neither is the taxpayer. Loans will be repaid by TBA from revenues collected from the sale of electricity.

27:45.920 --> 27:53.920
Immediately after TBA asked Congress for authority to borrow money, enemies of the TBA tried to slam the door in its face.

27:53.920 --> 28:01.920
They were successful in delaying the passage of the self-financing bill last year. When it passed the site, it was pigeonholed in the house.

28:01.920 --> 28:12.920
But finally, we made it. And TBA cannot take steps to expand its power generating facilities for the betterment of both home, farm and industry.

28:12.920 --> 28:21.920
While friends on the dim side, I must report that necessary monies for the proposed melt and hill and cartage dams will have to await the next session of Congress.

28:21.920 --> 28:27.920
These projects are number one on my list of must appropriations in the 1960s session.

28:27.920 --> 28:38.920
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I was instrumental in pushing through a million 250,000 dollar appropriation for preliminary work on these two dams.

28:39.920 --> 28:45.920
This appropriation was backed off, however, when in conference for the House of Representatives. We did our best.

28:45.920 --> 28:52.920
It's now hope that indeed my conviction that next year we'll mark the start of these projects. You may be assured of my continued effort.

28:52.920 --> 28:56.920
Thank you very much and until next week.

28:57.920 --> 29:10.920
Ladies and gentlemen, Friends of Tennessee, I want to discuss an unpleasant problem with you today.

29:10.920 --> 29:21.920
On my frequent trips to Tennessee recently, many parents have expressed a growing alarm over efforts that are being made to expose our children to a flood of filthy, obscene material.

29:22.920 --> 29:28.920
Those who spread this viral material among our young people are without question, the lowest drags of society.

29:28.920 --> 29:32.920
But we cannot turn our backs on them and hope that they will go away.

29:32.920 --> 29:38.920
While some progress has been made in the battle against these smut peddlers, but the war is far from being won.

29:38.920 --> 29:49.920
Lude material is still being sent into millions of American homes despite all the local law enforcement agencies, the post office department and the department of justice have been able to do it.

29:50.920 --> 29:59.920
It has been reliably estimated that the smut peddling business is in excess of one half billion, yes, one half billion dollars a year.

29:59.920 --> 30:17.920
Last year after a lengthy effort, we succeeded in amending the law to make it possible for the department of justice to prosecute pornography, not only in the district where the material is mailed, but also in districts through which the material passes and the district into which it is mailed.

30:17.920 --> 30:28.920
Only last week I went down and discussed this problem with Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield, and he informed me that several convictions have recently been obtained under the new law.

30:28.920 --> 30:36.920
He believes that the diligent use of the new law will result in the successful prosecution of many more of these smut peddlers.

30:36.920 --> 30:49.920
In spite of this progress, however, he believes and I believe that there are certain other changes which can be made in the law which will further strengthen the hand to those who are attempting to close the mails to obscene material.

30:49.920 --> 30:59.920
For this in view, I introduced just a few days ago a bill to strengthen the criminal penalties for the mailing, importation and transportation of obscene matter.

30:59.920 --> 31:14.920
A substantial number of senators have joined as co-sponsors of this bill, including Senator Eastland of Mississippi, Johnson of South Carolina, Church of Idaho, Senator McNamara, Michigan, and Talmadge of Georgia to mention just a few.

31:15.920 --> 31:32.920
The first of the changes in our bill deals with the law and punishment. Most people who deal in pornography are fly by nighters. Usually they receive only light fans, then they change addresses and change their name sometime and go right back into the same old filthy business.

31:33.920 --> 31:49.920
These most despicable members of our society deal in dirt, not for dirt's sake, but for money's sake. The only way to curb their activity is to see to it that they are put behind bars if they continue in this low and illegal kind of business.

31:49.920 --> 31:56.920
If for no other reason they will be curbed because the parents of America both organized and unorganized demanded.

31:57.920 --> 32:17.920
While mandatory deal sentences on first convictions might seem so harsh that courts and juries would not convict them sometime, I do believe the deal sentences on second offenses would make a person think a long time before continuing in this filthy business if he knows that he is heading for a long deal sentence.

32:17.920 --> 32:27.920
I believe this two time loser provision in our bill under title one would go a long way toward discouraging the number of regular repeaters in this filthy business.

32:28.920 --> 32:42.920
Title two of our bill incorporates several changes suggested by the postmaster general and the provisions authorizing the temporary impounding of certain mail to bring about the closing of the mails to obscene to obscene matter.

32:43.920 --> 32:50.920
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is a very important bill, one of the most important that I have introduced in a long time.

32:51.920 --> 33:08.920
As I have said these peddlers of filth must be and shall be curred. In addition to the demand of our parents, virtually every religious civil civic and paternal group in the country is on record in favor of stricter laws against the evil dissemination of hardcore pornography.

33:09.920 --> 33:20.920
We have set prompt hearings on this bill and hope to have testimony next week by postmaster general summary feel and several leading churchmen.

33:21.920 --> 33:26.920
It is true that this subject is the most unpleasant one but it must be dealt with and now is the time to do it.

33:27.920 --> 33:34.920
And I think that the public will back and the congress will certainly pass this bill by almost a unanimous vote. Thank you very much.
