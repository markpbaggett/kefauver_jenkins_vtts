00:00.000 --> 00:07.080
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, today on the program we are delighted to have

00:07.080 --> 00:11.120
one of the finest members of the United States Senate.

00:11.120 --> 00:14.960
A person that I think is a real statesman.

00:14.960 --> 00:19.680
Senator Mike Manrone of the State of Oklahoma, Mike, we might like to have you with us today.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.600
Thank you, I see some probably here.

00:21.600 --> 00:28.440
Senator Manrone came to the House of Representatives January 1939.

00:28.440 --> 00:34.560
One time our colleague, who is his very dear friend, also Albert Gore, came and I came

00:34.560 --> 00:36.680
a few months later.

00:36.680 --> 00:40.080
Then we came over to the Senate later on.

00:40.080 --> 00:45.240
We remember that he was the sponsor of the Fowlet Manrone Bill for the reorganization of

00:45.240 --> 00:50.200
Congress and he is one of the most thoughtful members of the United States Senate.

00:50.200 --> 00:55.240
Mike, you've been very active and I've said it to Gore and I joined with you to the extent

00:55.240 --> 01:03.040
that we could and securing passage of an education bill in the United States Senate a few

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
days ago.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.040
Will you tell us something about it?

01:05.040 --> 01:08.720
Well, this I think was one of the greatest forward steps the Senate has taken.

01:08.720 --> 01:14.920
The bill, as it came to us, provided roughly $500 million limited for school construction.

01:14.920 --> 01:21.280
We, the amendment which you and Albert and some 31 other Democratic Senator sponsored,

01:21.280 --> 01:27.680
added teacher salaries as well as construction and provided for a $20 per capita payment

01:27.680 --> 01:29.400
to the States.

01:29.400 --> 01:35.680
Thus in this amendment, the key fall for Gore and Manrone amendment and others, we raised

01:35.680 --> 01:40.600
to a degree about $400 million, the annual cost of the bill, but we made it possible for

01:40.600 --> 01:45.880
the States to direct whether they wanted this money for construction or for teacher salaries

01:45.880 --> 01:47.320
or how they wish to divide it.

01:47.320 --> 01:52.720
So it's a completely state-operated bill and one I think that properly evaluates the

01:52.720 --> 01:59.000
great and pressing need for teacher salaries to obtain the very best possible teaching

01:59.000 --> 02:03.400
and at the same time keep the good teachers still in the school as we're turn over as

02:03.400 --> 02:05.200
tremendous in the teaching profession.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.680
Well, Michael, I was, of course, led to do everything I could for his passage but you were

02:09.680 --> 02:13.440
the principal sponsor and some of us just helped.

02:14.440 --> 02:19.480
The Tennessee Education Association has passed a week at a meeting in which they were

02:19.480 --> 02:24.640
asking if there would be some little raise by the State and the school teacher salary.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.640
These funds could be used for the purpose of, as the State saw it for the purpose of

02:28.640 --> 02:31.120
giving some raise in their discretion.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.920
Anyway, the State wishes to divide it between construction and teacher salaries and our

02:35.920 --> 02:41.440
investigation shows that the municipalities and local agencies of government are incapable

02:41.440 --> 02:45.480
of raising the funds necessary to pay an adequate salary to keep the business.

02:45.480 --> 02:49.580
It doesn't make a lot of sense just to have buildings unless you can have adequate and

02:49.580 --> 02:50.580
well qualified teachers.

02:50.580 --> 02:51.580
Certainly, too.

02:51.580 --> 02:52.580
I'll go hand in hand.

02:52.580 --> 02:56.280
How about the argument that this might lead to federal control of our school?

02:56.280 --> 03:00.200
Well, the bill is carefully guarded against that providing that can't be any federal control.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.640
The action of the Senate showed we didn't want any federal control, didn't put it on a

03:03.640 --> 03:08.400
formula basis to what percent buildings and what percent teachers we trust the State

03:08.400 --> 03:10.600
and the local subdivisions divide it properly.

03:10.600 --> 03:16.320
The State has really given them some leeway and I don't think there's any danger of federal

03:16.320 --> 03:17.320
control in it.

03:17.320 --> 03:21.680
Well, this is one of the most far-right steps that we'll have been taken during this session

03:21.680 --> 03:22.680
of Congress.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.280
I mean, certainly hope the House of Representatives goes along.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.280
I certainly give to you.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.280
I want to ask you briefly one other thing.

03:28.280 --> 03:34.480
Senator Monroni has chairman of the Committee that investigates and has to do with legislation

03:34.480 --> 03:37.560
affecting aviation now.

03:37.560 --> 03:44.280
Tell us a little bit about what the trouble is with so many planes falling and so many difficulties

03:44.280 --> 03:45.680
and what you have recommended.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.280
Well, actually, we're not in too bad a shape.

03:48.280 --> 03:55.000
We only ran one-sixty-eighth of a percent per one hundred million miles, a passenger

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
miles, flown.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.200
This is way below what we figured would be a good safety margin, but we need better ground

04:01.200 --> 04:05.920
aids, approach lighting, better runway lighting, thirty-five percent of the accidents occur

04:05.920 --> 04:07.640
in flight in this area.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.640
We need...

04:08.640 --> 04:09.640
You mean near the runway?

04:09.640 --> 04:10.640
Yeah, the runway.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.920
To guide the pilot in for the final touchdown and only three airports have modern two-way

04:14.920 --> 04:16.680
lighting on their principal runway.

04:16.680 --> 04:23.480
We need better air reporting, twenty percent of our air stations reporting weather are only

04:23.480 --> 04:27.920
on part-time and we need very many other things as well.

04:27.920 --> 04:32.320
Well, you've done a great job in trying to get adequate funds for airport construction

04:32.320 --> 04:35.840
and safety control and you've gotten something but not enough.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
Thank you.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.840
Well, I wish we could go on.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.800
We certainly appreciate you coming at McMonroni and being with us today and a lot of people

04:41.800 --> 04:45.960
in Tennessee know you until this time next week.

04:45.960 --> 04:46.960
That's all for now.
