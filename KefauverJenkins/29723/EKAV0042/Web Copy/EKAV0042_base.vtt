00:00.000 --> 00:20.280
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we in Hamilton County and in Chattanooga are

00:20.280 --> 00:26.080
mighty proud of our county and of our city and the very fine governments we have, the

00:26.080 --> 00:30.680
very fine progress that we are making in the city of Chattanooga. We have the honor

00:30.680 --> 00:36.840
today of having with us two of our outstanding public officials in the city of Chattanooga

00:36.840 --> 00:43.200
are very great mayor Rudy O'Juddy who is here with our commissioner of Macon Turf to see

00:43.200 --> 00:48.400
about some important business affecting the people of Chattanooga. Rudy, will you tell

00:48.400 --> 00:54.240
us briefly what took place in Washington and what we were here for?

00:54.240 --> 01:00.280
Senator, we first I want to say that we appreciate the courage that you've shown us and to

01:00.280 --> 01:04.880
take out of your business schedule the time to make the appointments that you have made and

01:04.880 --> 01:11.440
we've been up here primarily interested in the disposition of the volunteer ordinance

01:11.440 --> 01:15.760
plan and the cramette properties that's owned by the federal government there. That's

01:15.760 --> 01:20.440
causing us a lot of concern for an employment standpoint.

01:20.440 --> 01:25.740
That's right and we did get the agreements that they would survey the situation and try

01:25.740 --> 01:31.480
to find some use and perhaps turn some of it over to local authorities for industrial

01:31.480 --> 01:38.200
sites and the event it was possible to do so. Well, good to have you here at Commissioner

01:38.200 --> 01:44.400
George Macon Turf and thank you Senator. It's always good to come to Washington and enjoy

01:44.400 --> 01:51.400
your hospitality. We appreciate the effort that you have made on behalf of the citizens

01:51.400 --> 01:57.760
of Hamilton County and Chattanooga and we feel that something good will come from this

01:57.760 --> 02:02.440
visit here today. Well, I think so too and of course all of us who live in Chattanooga

02:02.440 --> 02:07.880
know of the remarkable developments that are taking place there. They are far seeing programs

02:07.880 --> 02:12.560
inaugurated by these gentlemen but we want the people in the other part of the state who

02:12.560 --> 02:17.120
may be viewing this program to know something about it. So, Mayor O'Joddy, if you tell

02:17.120 --> 02:20.640
us about some of the things that are taking place in Chattanooga now, let's talk about

02:20.640 --> 02:24.800
the highway program first. We have a great highway program in the city of Chattanooga

02:24.800 --> 02:31.160
and our state system. We tell you the truth across the board. We have a hundred million

02:31.160 --> 02:37.480
dollar public works program which is highways, airports, schools, fire protection, sewers

02:37.480 --> 02:42.160
and all the things that go along with it. Railroad relocation and urban renewal and we

02:42.160 --> 02:48.440
made a lot of progress. We have three contracts just about completed. One is completed. The

02:48.440 --> 02:52.640
contract led for two more just this month and we're making good progress in our highway

02:52.640 --> 02:56.560
program. Well, it certainly is evident to see when you go there. Do you want to add anything

02:56.560 --> 03:00.680
to that commission to make? Well, I want to say a word about our urban renewal program.

03:00.680 --> 03:07.800
We're taking a section of Chattanooga composed of more than 400 acres and redeveloping the

03:07.800 --> 03:15.080
entire area and it's going to insert new life into downtown Chattanooga. It's a very progressive

03:15.080 --> 03:22.920
program and we're getting the full cooperation of the entire city in this urban renewal program.

03:22.920 --> 03:28.040
It's going to revitalize downtown Chattanooga. Well, I agree with you. This urban renewal is one of

03:28.040 --> 03:34.840
the best projects of the federal, state and local governments can do together. Well, Mayor O'Joddy,

03:34.840 --> 03:40.920
tell us about the airport program. You've done a whole lot with the airport down there. We have

03:40.920 --> 03:45.400
fine airports, Chattanooga, but it's like every other airport in the country we're having more

03:45.400 --> 03:51.720
air travel and that means more expansion and we do have a two and a half million dollar expansion

03:51.720 --> 03:57.160
program contemplated for our airport. Well, we've tried to get an appropriation for the federal

03:57.160 --> 04:02.120
government to assist and certainly as needed isn't it, Commissioner? It surely is. In Senator,

04:02.760 --> 04:09.800
we're concerned about the TVA self-financing bill which just recently passed the Senate.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.520
Well, we all are because Chattanooga is the center of a lot of the TVA activities and we

04:15.080 --> 04:19.960
happy to report the bill passed the Senate in acceptable form not as good as we would like and

04:20.600 --> 04:25.080
that the House will probably agree to the Senate amendments and it'll go on to the President

04:25.080 --> 04:30.600
and I certainly hope the President is going to sign the bill. Well, Mayor O'Joddy, you want to add

04:30.600 --> 04:36.200
anything about the TVA program or the highway program? Well, we have it that you've gotten us

04:36.200 --> 04:43.000
far along with the TVA self-financing bill that you have and we hope it goes on to the President's

04:43.000 --> 04:48.680
signature and this highway program of course the financing has been concerned us very much. I

04:48.680 --> 04:53.800
think it's just the mud that we go on. I agree with you and I. I'm sorry gentlemen. Thank you very

04:53.800 --> 05:04.200
much, Mayor O'Joddy and Commissioner McIntyre. Until next week, goodbye.
