00:00.000 --> 00:10.180
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we were supposed to have Senator Marnoni of

00:10.180 --> 00:16.320
Oklahoma on this program with us today to talk about the school bill that is being considered

00:16.320 --> 00:20.560
right now on the floor of the Senate for both school construction.

00:20.560 --> 00:25.400
And Senator Marnoni is amendment to see that some grandin' aid is made to the states to

00:25.400 --> 00:32.000
be distributed by the states without any strings attached to help with increasing or

00:32.000 --> 00:34.320
paying something on teacher salaries.

00:34.320 --> 00:39.520
Senator Marnoni is speaking now and the amendment will come up for a vote very soon.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.640
I stepped away to come on down to report to you.

00:43.640 --> 00:48.960
In his place I have with my very handsome and personable administrative assistant, Charlie

00:48.960 --> 00:55.280
Calwell, who will ask some questions about the legislation we've been considering this

00:55.280 --> 00:56.280
week in the Senate.

00:56.280 --> 01:00.040
Well, I'm kind of a poor last minute substitute for Senator Marnoni.

01:00.040 --> 01:04.880
But we'll have him back next week and we'll let the viewers of this station compare you

01:04.880 --> 01:06.200
and Senator Marnoni.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.880
Senator, you supported the amendment that would give states the opportunity to use some

01:11.880 --> 01:17.520
of the federal money for schools towards teacher salaries and what happened to that amendment

01:17.520 --> 01:18.520
last night.

01:18.520 --> 01:25.400
Well, we start off with the administration had proposed some lending program which for

01:25.400 --> 01:29.240
school construction which was defeated.

01:29.240 --> 01:34.800
And we had the Senator McNamara Bill for just school construction, $500 million over

01:34.800 --> 01:37.120
a period of years.

01:37.120 --> 01:45.640
Senator Clark of Pennsylvania offered an amendment to have $1,100,100,000 to be divided by the

01:45.640 --> 01:51.920
states and their usual proportion between school construction and teacher salary.

01:51.920 --> 01:58.840
That was defeated, $44,000 to $45,000, and the vice president voted and broke the tie

01:58.840 --> 02:02.640
so it was defeated, $45,000 to $44,000.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.400
And lost by that very narrow margin late last night.

02:07.400 --> 02:14.880
I spoke for the amendment as my colleague Senator Gore because we feel that education

02:14.880 --> 02:21.160
is the greatest importance right now not only because of our contest with the Soviet Union

02:21.160 --> 02:22.560
but for our general welfare.

02:22.560 --> 02:28.520
And you can have all the schools in the world but unless we have a start paying our teachers

02:28.520 --> 02:35.360
more than what might just pay a fireman, we're not going to have good education.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.360
It's absolutely imperative.

02:37.360 --> 02:42.560
Senator, have you had any expressions of support from the state of Tennessee for this bill?

02:42.560 --> 02:43.560
Yes, I certainly have.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.240
I've had a good letter from Governor Ellington in support of it.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.680
I've had many much factual information from Commissioner Joe Morgan.

02:51.680 --> 02:56.280
They tell us the education association is actively far ahead.

02:56.280 --> 03:00.320
Teachers, parents, members of the parent teachers association.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.400
And what do you think Senator of the charge that the opponents of the bill have made that

03:04.400 --> 03:07.680
this bill would lead to federal control of the schools?

03:07.680 --> 03:10.720
Well, I don't think that's well-founded.

03:10.720 --> 03:16.320
We've had the moral plan that found help with universities or what any federal control.

03:16.320 --> 03:20.680
We've had the PWA program for school construction.

03:20.680 --> 03:26.880
And if said in the amendment and in the bill itself that there shall be no federal control

03:26.880 --> 03:32.400
that the money is a grant and aid to the states for them to use for school construction and

03:32.400 --> 03:34.400
for teachers.

03:34.400 --> 03:39.120
And the federal government has no right to have any administrative control, control of

03:39.120 --> 03:41.920
curriculum or anything else of that kind.

03:41.920 --> 03:48.160
In the few moments we have left, Senator, would you tell us about the SJ Res 39 about the

03:48.160 --> 03:50.440
congressional seats that was passed this last year?

03:50.440 --> 03:56.000
Well, before we end, I hope by the time this telecast is seen that we will have passed this

03:56.000 --> 04:01.040
national aid to education bill in the United States Senate and becomes law.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.360
Well, we passed a very important constitutional amendment last week.

04:04.360 --> 04:09.640
I think I discussed the part of the amendment that I filed originally to enable governors

04:09.640 --> 04:14.680
to temporarily fill vacancies in the House of Representatives and they have been of a national

04:14.680 --> 04:17.240
disaster, so our Congress could go on.

04:17.240 --> 04:24.080
Two, that was added, the Holland amendment to make to take away the requirement of a

04:24.080 --> 04:29.880
poll tax for voting for federal officials and the four or five states that still have it.

04:29.880 --> 04:34.280
And also the Keating Amendment to give some right of the people of the district to vote

04:34.280 --> 04:37.480
for national electors for President and Vice President.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.280
I believe, Charlie, that's all the time we have.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.840
Thank you and goodbye until next week.
