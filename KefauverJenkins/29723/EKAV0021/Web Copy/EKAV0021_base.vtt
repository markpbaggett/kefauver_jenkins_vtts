00:00.000 --> 00:17.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, today we are very happy to have on this program,

00:17.920 --> 00:23.240
and I'm very proud to be able to introduce to all of you the distinguished Attorney General

00:23.240 --> 00:27.260
of the United States Robert Kennedy.

00:27.260 --> 00:32.380
And I want to say in that connection that I think that Mr. Kennedy is making an excellent

00:32.380 --> 00:33.380
Attorney General.

00:33.380 --> 00:37.340
I was proud to support him.

00:37.340 --> 00:42.900
I don't want to say too many things to embarrass him here in his presence, but as all of

00:42.900 --> 00:49.900
you know, he is 35 years old and is the youngest Attorney General that we've had in more

00:49.900 --> 00:51.780
than 100 years.

00:51.780 --> 00:53.780
I don't know what happened to that fellow Bob.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.780
It was younger than you.

00:55.780 --> 00:56.780
I don't know how to go.

00:56.780 --> 01:02.300
But in any event, I think that Attorney General Kennedy is surrounding himself with very

01:02.300 --> 01:09.980
able assistance that he is going to be a determined and active and courageous Attorney General.

01:09.980 --> 01:15.820
And I think we'll be mighty proud of the record that he is going to make or that he is making.

01:15.820 --> 01:22.660
We have a special interest in one person and your immediate staff, Mr. Attorney General,

01:22.660 --> 01:25.220
that's John Seagland-Failer.

01:25.220 --> 01:29.300
John was the Assistant City Editor of the National Tennessee and how did you get mixed

01:29.300 --> 01:30.300
up with John?

01:30.300 --> 01:36.300
Well, we were investigating some three years ago, I guess, Senator.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.700
I was Counselor of the Senate Records Committee and we were investigating a situation down in

01:39.700 --> 01:46.420
Tennessee involving some corruption and dishonesty and involving a judge in Tennessee.

01:46.420 --> 01:51.620
And John Sigmothola was the one that first brought it to our attention as well as followed

01:51.620 --> 01:54.940
shortly afterwards by a number of your other citizens there.

01:54.940 --> 02:01.500
And we made an investigation, held some hearings and he was very instrumental in uncovering

02:01.500 --> 02:04.340
information which was ultimately revealed at our hearings.

02:04.340 --> 02:11.100
And then later on, you know, your legislature picked it up and the judge was impeached.

02:11.100 --> 02:15.180
And I think that he covered that and was very helpful to them also.

02:15.180 --> 02:20.300
So I got to know him then and he worked in the campaign with us.

02:20.300 --> 02:25.420
He was my administrative assistant and when I was out speaking in the country, he was really

02:25.420 --> 02:26.740
running the whole campaign.

02:26.740 --> 02:31.540
And so after I was appointed to this position, I asked him if he'd come and be my assistant

02:31.540 --> 02:32.540
here.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.620
So I think that I'm very fortunate in having him.

02:34.620 --> 02:37.180
Well, we all think that John is a very able man.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.980
I know he's working awfully hard.

02:38.980 --> 02:45.860
Well, I want to say, folks, that I think the new program, our president Kennedy, is getting

02:45.860 --> 02:46.860
started off fine.

02:46.860 --> 02:47.860
There's a lot of activity.

02:47.860 --> 02:53.260
There are many plans to do many things that are necessary, such as the area redevelopment

02:53.260 --> 02:54.260
bill.

02:54.260 --> 02:55.460
He's gotten food out to the needy.

02:55.460 --> 03:00.420
We have programs that will soon be before the Senate in connection with raising the

03:00.420 --> 03:07.820
minimum wage and extending the coverage assistance to the aged and medical assistance.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.700
So the things are really humming in Washington.

03:09.700 --> 03:13.940
Of course, there's a lot of confusion and difficulty and the transition from one administration

03:13.940 --> 03:14.940
to another.

03:15.340 --> 03:20.620
A marble sometime, how president Kennedy stands all of the strain that must be placed upon

03:20.620 --> 03:24.540
him during this very difficult time.

03:24.540 --> 03:28.820
Bob, I know you see your brother, John, very often.

03:28.820 --> 03:29.820
How's he feeling?

03:29.820 --> 03:31.820
Well, I think very well.

03:31.820 --> 03:35.860
As I believe you know, Senator, I don't think there's anything that is more difficult than

03:35.860 --> 03:39.060
an arduous campaign.

03:39.060 --> 03:44.580
You went through the campaign in Wisconsin, I believe four years ago, and we went through

03:44.580 --> 03:47.500
it just a year ago, and I don't think anything could be as tough as that.

03:47.500 --> 03:53.660
And then the campaign, New Hampshire, and traveling all around the country making as many

03:53.660 --> 04:00.260
as 20 or 22 speeches a day and sleeping four or five hours, that this actually is less

04:00.260 --> 04:04.380
difficult physically than that kind of an operation.

04:04.380 --> 04:08.060
And then you mean being president is less difficult than all this campaign?

04:08.060 --> 04:09.060
Certainly physically.

04:09.540 --> 04:14.540
Of all that traveling and all that strain or making speeches continuously.

04:14.540 --> 04:21.060
So I think that he's getting extremely healthy and in a very good position to make some

04:21.060 --> 04:22.060
of these decisions.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.980
I think health makes a big difference if you're healthy.

04:23.980 --> 04:26.780
You can meet these problems and difficulties much easier.

04:26.780 --> 04:32.140
And I've never seen his health better than it's been over the period of the last year or

04:32.140 --> 04:33.140
so.

04:33.140 --> 04:38.340
And as I say, I think that it's not a great deal different than what he's been through

04:38.340 --> 04:39.340
in the past.

04:39.340 --> 04:45.340
Well, I must say that when Senator Gore and I went down to see him last week at time when

04:45.340 --> 04:50.900
President Jackson's portrait was put back up in the conference room, he certainly looked

04:50.900 --> 04:58.900
well and very keen and interested in anxious to get all of the ideas he could.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.380
That's a wonderful picture, I think.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.380
Yes, I think it is.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.580
It should have been up on the wall all the time.

05:04.580 --> 05:13.060
I have a very interesting letter that I obtained in an auction some years ago of President Jackson

05:13.060 --> 05:19.660
that he wrote just before the battle in New Orleans to his wife telling about the positions

05:19.660 --> 05:23.620
of the British and what he anticipated for the future.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.020
Well, that's a very precious letter.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.620
Yes, and a very touching letter too.

05:27.620 --> 05:28.620
Very touching.

05:28.620 --> 05:32.620
Well, at any time that you don't have some precious place to keep it, I know the Hermitage

05:32.620 --> 05:36.020
would be glad to have it on there among their precious documents.

05:36.020 --> 05:42.380
Then we have a state library that has a collection of Andrew Jackson's letters and papers and

05:42.380 --> 05:44.060
no doubt you've seen it down at the time.

05:44.060 --> 05:48.180
I did, I visited there and I visited the Hermitage.

05:48.180 --> 05:58.140
I've got a also that was a very important momento to me, a gavill that was sent by the governor

05:58.140 --> 06:05.740
which is taken from the desk of President Jackson when he was living in Nashville, Tennessee.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.260
I believe the governor of Beefard Allings and brought that up to Washington.

06:08.260 --> 06:09.260
He was very nice.

06:09.260 --> 06:12.060
I have that on my desk at the Attorney General's office.

06:12.060 --> 06:15.060
Do you ever have to use it to keep your associates in order?

06:15.060 --> 06:18.460
John seconds all occasionally, but other than him.

06:18.460 --> 06:23.260
I noticed in the paper that you're a wonderful assistant, Byron, Wizard White.

06:23.260 --> 06:24.260
Yes.

06:24.260 --> 06:27.380
Probably got a little too nervous and has gone to the hospital for a few days.

06:27.380 --> 06:30.820
He said some difficulty with his stomach, but...

06:30.820 --> 06:32.900
Well, he's a wonderful fellow.

06:32.900 --> 06:38.900
One thing I think about you and your outstanding brother and all of the candidates you have,

06:38.900 --> 06:45.380
the tremendous energy and interest and the power to relax, which is of what anyone in public

06:45.380 --> 06:46.380
office needs.

06:46.380 --> 06:51.420
Well, do you mind if I, we talk a little bit about how things are going?

06:51.420 --> 06:55.100
How do you feel that the new program is going generally, the new frontier?

06:55.100 --> 06:58.460
Well, I think that we're making a good deal of progress, the senator.

06:58.460 --> 07:07.060
I think, of course, it's early, it's only been, I think, it's 40 days since the inauguration.

07:07.060 --> 07:12.700
I think that the President has shown by the various programs that he's offered, that he

07:12.700 --> 07:17.380
feels it's necessary and essential that the country move again in many areas.

07:17.380 --> 07:22.340
And here in the United States and in our relationship with other countries, and he's trying to

07:22.340 --> 07:29.740
take some steps to get some of these programs accepted by Congress and accepted by the American

07:29.740 --> 07:30.820
people.

07:30.820 --> 07:33.500
And I think that there's some good deal of progress as being made.

07:33.500 --> 07:39.300
Of course, I think that we all, everybody appreciates the fact that before a great many things

07:39.300 --> 07:43.260
can be done, the cabinet members have to have hearings before the committees and they

07:43.260 --> 07:44.260
have to be confirmed.

07:44.260 --> 07:49.740
And I believe that all the cabinet members and practically all of the people who have

07:49.740 --> 07:53.180
to come before the Senate to be confirmed have been confirmed.

07:53.180 --> 07:54.180
That's correct, yes.

07:54.180 --> 07:57.020
And I don't believe today that any of them have been turned down.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.020
No, they have.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.780
Which speaks mighty well for the people who are being selected.

08:00.780 --> 08:08.940
Well, Mr. Attorney General or Bob, if I may call you that, tell us, I have the feeling

08:08.940 --> 08:16.700
that the Attorney General, the Department of Justice is really humming and the things

08:16.700 --> 08:20.980
are going and everybody is working hard with the determination to enforce the law and to

08:20.980 --> 08:24.060
improve the enforcement of the law.

08:24.060 --> 08:25.700
Tell us something about your plans.

08:25.700 --> 08:31.620
How about in the antitrust field where we have had a shocking experience recently, finding

08:31.620 --> 08:38.820
the some officials in the electrical manufacturing industry, fixing prices, talking things over

08:38.820 --> 08:44.900
violating the law and they've now, some of them have been sent to penal institution for

08:44.900 --> 08:48.140
and up on their plea of guilty.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.140
What about that?

08:49.140 --> 08:53.780
Well, there are going to be a number of cases that are going to arise out of those cases,

08:53.780 --> 08:54.780
Senator.

08:54.780 --> 09:01.940
As you are well aware, because I think that was first initially developed by your committee,

09:01.940 --> 09:06.620
the facts that which ultimately led up to their indictment and their conviction.

09:06.620 --> 09:13.540
There were sales, for instance, to TVA where we are shown that the sales were handled through

09:13.540 --> 09:18.340
rig bidding, the contractors getting together amongst themselves and determining what the

09:18.340 --> 09:21.220
prices should be, who should get the bid.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.220
The government is now going to take action.

09:23.220 --> 09:32.060
I would think within about six weeks to try to collect damages from the electric companies

09:32.060 --> 09:37.020
in the areas in which they were defrauded, one of the major areas will be in the TVA,

09:37.020 --> 09:41.220
but there will be a number of other government agencies whose contracts will be studied to

09:41.220 --> 09:46.660
determine whether we can also bring some action at the federal level.

09:46.660 --> 09:51.980
We will continue to be working in this whole area of price fixing.

09:51.980 --> 09:56.700
I think it has a very important effect on local communities.

09:56.700 --> 10:02.300
This last electrical case had a nationwide effect, but there are many other similar cases

10:02.300 --> 10:06.900
which have an effect on a state or on a particular city or in a community.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.380
We are investigating a number of those.

10:09.380 --> 10:14.620
I might say that we are extremely appreciative of the help and cooperation and the very

10:14.620 --> 10:20.140
important leads that we have received from your committee because I think that that kind

10:20.140 --> 10:23.380
of information that you have given to the executive branch of the government has been

10:23.380 --> 10:27.900
almost essential for us to proceed in these areas.

10:27.900 --> 10:34.120
I would hope that you in turn will be continuing your hearing so that the two branches of

10:34.120 --> 10:36.020
the government can work together in this manner.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.020
Thank you, Bob.

10:37.020 --> 10:41.700
I have been the chairman of the Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee for a number of years

10:41.700 --> 10:48.700
and never have we received better cooperation or more sympathetic attitude from anyone than

10:48.700 --> 10:52.100
we have from you as the new Attorney General.

10:52.100 --> 10:57.460
We did find that beds are to the TVA, even though companies might be in different parts

10:57.460 --> 11:02.620
of the United States have different labor costs, even though they were secret beds that

11:02.620 --> 11:07.280
strangely they were identical and that they were so often they would be a rotation

11:07.280 --> 11:10.220
so as to give the bed to some particular company.

11:10.220 --> 11:14.700
I think the public ought to understand that this is very destructive of our free enterprise

11:14.700 --> 11:15.700
system.

11:15.700 --> 11:20.620
It is a kind of thing that we cannot tolerate and we are going to work out along with you

11:20.620 --> 11:22.860
and further investigations.

11:22.860 --> 11:27.420
But this might be going on in other lands of industry and I suppose that you and we will

11:27.420 --> 11:28.420
be looking in.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.420
Yes.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.420
Yes.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.420
Yes.

11:31.420 --> 11:37.500
You made a great record as General Counsel or Chief Counsel of the Senate Records Committee

11:37.500 --> 11:40.740
headed up by Senator John McClellan of Arkansas.

11:40.740 --> 11:47.180
I admired your courage and your energy and thoroughness in carrying out the work of that

11:47.180 --> 11:48.180
committee.

11:48.820 --> 11:54.540
I have been very pleased to know about your attitude and your determination to do something

11:54.540 --> 12:01.020
to try to rid the nation of the least check or stop where we can influence the criminal

12:01.020 --> 12:02.020
element.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.780
Will you tell us something about that, Mr. Attorney General?

12:04.780 --> 12:11.060
Well, I think that the situation since 1950 when you first developed these matters has

12:11.060 --> 12:14.140
become even more critical.

12:14.140 --> 12:20.660
And I think that the necessary and essential executive branch of the government step in

12:20.660 --> 12:28.820
with a forceful program, I think rising the steps that will be taken, rising out of the

12:28.820 --> 12:34.700
conference that you and Senator McClellan and Jay Agahuber, the FBI and I had the Department

12:34.700 --> 12:39.220
of Justice several weeks ago that there will be important steps taken.

12:39.220 --> 12:43.740
I don't think that this problem will be solved overnight as both of us recognize.

12:43.740 --> 12:51.060
But I think we can take certain steps which will make a major difference in many areas

12:51.060 --> 12:53.620
of the United States to stamp out organized crime.

12:53.620 --> 12:58.260
Well, I know something about your plans and I'm certain that great benefits will come

12:58.260 --> 12:59.260
from it.

12:59.260 --> 13:04.180
And I know that people all over the country who are interested in stamping out organized

13:04.180 --> 13:07.740
crime, better law enforcement are going to be encouraged.

13:07.740 --> 13:12.580
And after all the activity of people at the local level is, that counts very, very much

13:12.580 --> 13:13.580
doesn't it?

13:13.580 --> 13:15.380
That's certainly does.

13:15.380 --> 13:22.540
Well, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Accountady has been down to Tennessee on many occasions.

13:22.540 --> 13:26.020
I know that many of you have met him and seen him.

13:26.020 --> 13:29.980
I know you will follow his career with a great deal of interest.

13:29.980 --> 13:34.300
And let me say again that I think when the history of this administration has written,

13:34.300 --> 13:39.180
I think that we will all record that he has been one of the great attorney generals

13:39.180 --> 13:40.700
in the history of our nation.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.780
We thank you very much, Bob, for coming on the program and see you again soon.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.780
Thank you, Senator.

13:45.780 --> 13:46.380
That's all for now.
