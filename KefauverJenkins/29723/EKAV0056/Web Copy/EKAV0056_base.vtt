00:00.000 --> 00:17.800
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, by the time you see this broadcast, in all

00:17.800 --> 00:22.560
probability Congress will have passed the labor reform bill.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.000
In recent weeks I have received a tremendous volume of letters and telegrams on the subject

00:28.000 --> 00:31.080
of proposed labor legislation.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.720
When the House passed this so-called Landon Griffith Substitute to the Senate Kennedy

00:35.720 --> 00:42.160
Irving Bill, to the Kennedy Irving Bill, my mail began to reach a peak of about 1,000

00:42.160 --> 00:44.760
letters and telegrams each day.

00:44.760 --> 00:50.320
I have tried to answer all of you during this time the two versions of the labor bill have

00:50.320 --> 00:53.320
been under consideration.

00:53.320 --> 00:58.800
And I reply to you during the time they have been under in conference has been in essence

00:58.800 --> 00:59.800
this.

00:59.800 --> 01:04.080
Let us give the countries a chance to come up with a bill which will correct racketeering

01:04.080 --> 01:10.120
and corruption, where it exists in the labor movement, but will not destroy the basic rights

01:10.120 --> 01:13.880
of millions of honest union men and women.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.720
I believe the countries have worked hard toward that end.

01:17.720 --> 01:22.120
The bill that came out of the conference was a great improvement over the original House

01:22.120 --> 01:24.320
Substitute version.

01:24.320 --> 01:28.560
And I think it's a bill that labor can live with even though many of them complain about

01:28.560 --> 01:29.560
it.

01:29.560 --> 01:35.840
I believe that both the Landon Griffith Bill and the Kennedy Irving Bill contained provisions

01:35.840 --> 01:42.720
that went a long way toward eliminating racketeering and corruption, where it was existed

01:42.720 --> 01:47.960
in the labor movement and where it was uncovered by the McClellan Committee.

01:47.960 --> 01:54.440
And I think all American citizens were disgusted with the corruption and racketeering it was

01:54.440 --> 01:56.840
uncovered by that committee.

01:56.840 --> 02:02.200
But I think it should be pointed out that this was in a relatively few unions and not in

02:02.200 --> 02:04.880
the great majority of them.

02:04.880 --> 02:10.160
I doubt that there was ever any great disagreement between the two bills in this area of union

02:10.160 --> 02:15.080
official responsibility and the right of union members.

02:15.080 --> 02:21.360
Both bills had provisions for protecting funds of union members to prevent racketeering,

02:21.360 --> 02:28.400
to prevent misuse of funds for secret ballots and for the right of union members to take

02:28.400 --> 02:31.800
place in elections and things of that kind.

02:31.800 --> 02:36.760
I do think there were some points in the House Bill which would have unfairly penalized

02:36.760 --> 02:39.560
honest labor unions.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.560
Through the earnest efforts of the countries, most of these have been eliminated and

02:43.560 --> 02:45.360
glad to say.

02:45.360 --> 02:49.920
If any further corrections are found to be needed in this respect, Congress will be here

02:49.920 --> 02:54.480
early next year and can consider them and take action.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.680
This friend has been a most difficult task for all concern.

02:58.680 --> 03:04.680
Give you an idea of the complexity and the intricacy of labor law that is involved in

03:04.680 --> 03:08.320
reaching a bill that will be most fair to all.

03:08.320 --> 03:13.600
Let me show you two key documents which the countries have been struggling with for

03:13.600 --> 03:16.200
12 grueling days.

03:16.200 --> 03:23.920
Here's the Landham Griffith Bill, technical 137 pages which really takes a fuller

03:23.920 --> 03:26.600
death for you to understand.

03:26.600 --> 03:33.440
Here's the Kennedy Irving Bill which the Senate debated and considered for nine days

03:33.440 --> 03:35.560
and many, many nights.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.040
Very intricate.

03:37.040 --> 03:46.560
Now out of these came the conference bill which I felt is fair which may have some provisions

03:46.560 --> 03:48.840
that need to be corrected.

03:48.840 --> 03:53.720
Everybody is not going to be satisfied with every provision in it but Senator Kennedy

03:53.720 --> 03:56.640
and Senator Goldwater.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.600
All of the countries except one said this was the best that they could do.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.520
I think the country wanted a labor bill.

04:03.520 --> 04:09.080
I think the union members want protection against any unfair practices.

04:09.080 --> 04:15.120
I think the purity of our union effort is of great importance and I'm glad that a bill

04:15.120 --> 04:21.240
has it long last been reported which will do a great deal to straighten out some situations

04:21.240 --> 04:23.600
in which I can support.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.600
I'm very sorry to report also that the public works bill was vetoed by the which was vetoed

04:28.600 --> 04:30.640
by the President.

04:30.640 --> 04:35.600
It was not overwritten in the effort in the House it missed by one vote.

04:35.600 --> 04:40.600
This included the West Tennessee tributaries and the Wolf River Project and Memphis.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.800
I hope we can get these in any other bill that's passed.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.680
That's all for now and thank you until next week.
