00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Go along with at least that.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
I wasn't sure about the approach of it.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
It has been killed in the house.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Are you considering something in the nature of

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
trying to provide health, facilities, or opportunities for these people?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Senator, we think that this is one of the real problems and one of the issues

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
that has to be man and soul.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
And while we don't subscribe any more than you do to the total package,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
so-called, and bill, we do think that this approach,

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
this through the social security system, is the proper approach for the solution

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
of providing some relief for people in this age category.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
And then there are several bills before our committee dealing with that subject in this manner.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Now there are about three or four million people who are uncovered,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
not covered by social security, which is like some provision for them also.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
We hope to be able to include in a bill that we will probably introduce in the next few days.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
The inclusion in our plan of these people as well.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
And then, well, that's one of the great problems and we have the problem that they can't work at

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
if they are on social security, and earn more than $1,200.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Well, I think everybody agrees that that should be raised.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And I want to say now, while I have a chance that you are making a great contribution

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
in your studies of drug prices, because these people who have crippling diseases,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
arthritis and such things, constantly are buying drugs.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
And your studies indicate that there has been an increase up to 1,000 percent,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I guess, between the cost and the retail price.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
And they do appreciate our testimony as full of the indications they do

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
appreciate your efforts to do something for them.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We appreciate your backing.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I wish we could talk about more problems, but that's all the time.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
We have, thank you very much, Senator Pat McNamara.
