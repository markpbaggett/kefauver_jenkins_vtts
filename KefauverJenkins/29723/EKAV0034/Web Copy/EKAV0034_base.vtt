00:00.000 --> 00:17.700
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the first session of the 86th Congress came

00:17.700 --> 00:23.380
to an end last week shortly after 6 a.m. on Tuesday, just before Mr. Cruise Chef arrived

00:23.380 --> 00:24.380
in town.

00:24.380 --> 00:29.660
One of the last pieces of business at the Senate and House acted upon was the question

00:29.660 --> 00:33.140
of whether or not to continue the Civil Rights Commission.

00:33.140 --> 00:38.380
I join my colleague, Senator Albert Gore and the Distinguished Majority Leader, and

00:38.380 --> 00:43.260
69 other senators in voting for the Continuance of this Commission.

00:43.260 --> 00:47.860
I predict that we will be more than happy that we have this group in being when the next

00:47.860 --> 00:53.160
session of the Congress sits next year, because sometime before the final vote was taken

00:53.160 --> 00:58.820
on its continuance, several senators who have been pushing hard for drastic punitive civil

00:58.820 --> 01:04.220
rights legislation gave notice that they will be ready to go to bat for such legislation

01:04.220 --> 01:07.680
on February 15th of next year.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.380
If we permit this extreme legislation, if we are to prevent this extreme legislation from

01:12.380 --> 01:17.300
passing, we will have in the Civil Rights Commission a powerful argument against taking

01:17.300 --> 01:22.900
hasty and punitive action, far as long as the Commission is seeking the answer to these

01:22.900 --> 01:28.500
problems, which have a direct effect on the South, drastic steps will be that much harder

01:28.500 --> 01:31.140
to ram through the Congress.

01:31.140 --> 01:35.300
When the Senate first considered establishing the Civil Rights Commission, I voted for

01:35.300 --> 01:36.300
it.

01:36.300 --> 01:41.780
Because I believe these are very serious problems that deserve careful and considered study.

01:41.780 --> 01:47.100
The right of every qualified citizen to vote, for instance, is to me sacred and basic.

01:47.100 --> 01:52.340
And I think any intelligent investigation of voting privileges of any of our citizens is

01:52.340 --> 01:54.060
worthwhile.

01:54.060 --> 01:58.820
The first report of the Commission, which I have studied very closely, is not I must say

01:58.820 --> 02:00.580
a very satisfactory one.

02:00.580 --> 02:06.020
I am aware, of course, of the limitations of time under which the Commission had to work.

02:06.020 --> 02:11.300
But that is really no excuse for a careless staff work or for half-big proposals, and

02:11.300 --> 02:13.740
the report shows both.

02:13.740 --> 02:18.500
I was glad to note however that the Commission recognizes that in 93 of the 95 counties

02:18.500 --> 02:23.580
of Tennessee, there is no question whatsoever of the right of any qualified citizen to

02:24.580 --> 02:26.340
vote, and we are proud of that.

02:26.340 --> 02:30.900
In two counties, there is somewhat of a problem, and that is something in which the thoughtful

02:30.900 --> 02:34.980
people of Tennessee and in date of these counties are concerned.

02:34.980 --> 02:40.500
But in one of these counties, Haywood, the Commission shows the result of end-up staff work.

02:40.500 --> 02:46.700
For example, allegations that niggros own more property and pay more taxes in that county

02:46.700 --> 02:51.420
than whites, and that they must observe a curfew, and that they are not permitted near

02:51.420 --> 02:55.220
the courthouse unless they have business, are just not true.

02:55.220 --> 02:56.940
I know that they are not true.

02:56.940 --> 03:01.140
I have visited Haywood County not once, but many, many times.

03:01.140 --> 03:06.900
I think such careless handling of the facts by a federal commission is inexcusable.

03:06.900 --> 03:11.540
I resented all the more because concerning Haywood County, because that is the home county

03:11.540 --> 03:17.220
of my late beloved mother, and I have many relatives and close friends there.

03:17.220 --> 03:21.260
Many of the recommendations of the Commission are just as carelessly conceived and wonder

03:21.260 --> 03:24.900
far from what I believe to be the intended scope.

03:24.900 --> 03:29.140
The recommendation, for instance, of federal registrars, for voting is one.

03:29.140 --> 03:33.340
That is a problem that must be handled locally and not from the top.

03:33.340 --> 03:39.260
I believe the Commission needlessly went into some fields of housing, which aggravates

03:39.260 --> 03:42.540
an already difficult situation.

03:42.540 --> 03:46.020
But while I am highly displeased with much of the Commission's work, although it does

03:46.020 --> 03:51.540
have some merit, frankly, I believe we must take a hard look at the alternatives to continuing

03:51.540 --> 03:52.540
the Commission.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.540
I did just that.

03:54.540 --> 03:58.340
And I believe the next session of Congress will bear out my conclusions.

03:58.340 --> 04:03.460
The extension of the Commission's life may be the best way we have to prevent legislation

04:03.460 --> 04:06.820
which would be harshly unfair to the South.

04:06.820 --> 04:13.660
If the South opposes even a study of the problems involved, then I'm afraid we may reap a whirlwind.

04:13.660 --> 04:17.140
As Commissioner Bottle, a distinguished member of the Commission and former Governor

04:17.140 --> 04:21.980
of Virginia said, we need to have considerably more discussion of the problems of human

04:21.980 --> 04:26.180
relations before legislative action is taken.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.740
Ladies and gentlemen, this will be the last telecast of this year.

04:28.740 --> 04:34.740
I want to thank the Station for carrying these as a public servant service.

04:34.740 --> 04:38.380
And I hope that we can continue them on next year.

04:38.380 --> 04:43.260
And I want to thank you who have watched these for your suggestions and for your ideas.

04:43.260 --> 04:46.620
And it's been my great pleasure to make them.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.580
Until the next session of Congress, goodbye.
