00:00.000 --> 00:10.680
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I have the great privilege today of introducing

00:10.680 --> 00:11.680
to you.

00:11.680 --> 00:17.040
I want you to meet a very good friend of mine in the United States Senate, an able senator

00:17.040 --> 00:21.280
from the state of Michigan, Senator Pat McNamara.

00:21.280 --> 00:27.120
Pat is sure as good to have you with us, and I'm glad to have, for my people in Tennessee,

00:27.120 --> 00:31.720
to have a chance of seeing you and of talking with you for a little while.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.720
Well thanks, Mr. President.

00:32.720 --> 00:36.160
Certainly a pleasure to be here with you today.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.480
Senator McNamara, the first time I had the privilege of meeting him, I went up to Flint,

00:40.480 --> 00:46.560
Michigan in 1954, when he was a candidate for the United States Senate at which time he

00:46.560 --> 00:48.800
was elected.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.880
And we had a large audience, so you remember Pat at the auditorium, and I was trying to

00:53.880 --> 00:58.720
get in to make a speech, but Senator McNamara was talking about problems of the age and

00:58.720 --> 01:02.480
age it, and how long did you keep me standing up before I got a chance?

01:02.480 --> 01:06.720
Well, I tried to hurry, yes, because I was very conscious of the fact that this was your

01:06.720 --> 01:11.120
audience, but I had such fine opportunity to talk to him about something that really bothered

01:11.120 --> 01:14.720
me, but I guess we kept you waiting the best part of 45 minutes.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.800
I like at least that, but it was a lot of fun anyway.

01:17.800 --> 01:23.600
Anyway, Senator McNamara is one of our able senators, and as soon as he got to Senate,

01:23.600 --> 01:30.320
he asked for the formation of a special committee to study problems of the age and ageing.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.120
And you were the chairman of that committee.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
That's right.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.400
Tell us some of the findings of your committee, Pat.

01:38.400 --> 01:47.600
Well, we find that there are 16 million Americans who are in this category of the ageing,

01:47.600 --> 01:54.560
who have great problems that our society has overlooked for a number of years.

01:54.560 --> 01:55.560
One of the great problems.

01:55.560 --> 02:01.000
Well, we have many more thanks to medicine and good medication.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.640
More people are living longer now than they used to.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.640
Oh, yes.

02:04.640 --> 02:09.640
At the turn of the century, we had only about 3 million in this category of 65 and over.

02:09.640 --> 02:13.360
And this is an indication about fast, this is just snowballing, Senator.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.280
Well, they certainly need someone to be studying and thinking about their particular problems.

02:17.280 --> 02:24.120
How about the financial income of people in that generally, in that class, Senator McNamara?

02:24.120 --> 02:32.040
Well, our studies have indicated up to now, Senator Keepover, that 3 out of 5, 60 percent

02:32.040 --> 02:37.760
of these people have a money income of less than $1,000 a year.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.960
So you see, they really have income problems.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.920
And then let's talk about some of the other problems.

02:42.920 --> 02:49.360
I know the 4-AND bill, which I didn't go along with, at least I wasn't sure about the

02:49.360 --> 02:51.560
approach of it, is I've been killed in the house.

02:51.560 --> 03:02.960
Are you considering something in the nature of trying to provide health facilities or opportunities

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
for these people?

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
Yes.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.320
Senator, we think that this is one of the real problems and one of the issues that has to

03:09.320 --> 03:12.080
be mad and solved.

03:12.080 --> 03:21.240
And while we don't subscribe any more than you do to the total package, so-called 4-AND bill,

03:21.240 --> 03:27.480
we do think that this approach, this through the social security system, is the proper approach

03:27.480 --> 03:31.920
for the solution of providing some relief for people in this age category.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.720
And then there are several bills before our committee dealing with that subject in this

03:36.720 --> 03:37.720
manner.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.120
Now there are about three or four million people who are uncovered, not covered by social

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
security.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.640
Would you like some provision for them also?

03:45.640 --> 03:49.800
We hope to be able to include an 8-Bill that we will probably introduce in the next

03:49.800 --> 03:52.120
few days, Senator.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.880
The inclusion in our plan of these people as well.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.360
And then, well, that's one of the great problems and we have the problem that they can't

04:01.360 --> 04:06.280
work on social security, and earn more than $1,200.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.280
I guess.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.200
Many, everybody agrees that that should be raised.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.760
And I want to say now, while I have a chance that you are making a great contribution

04:12.760 --> 04:20.680
in your studies of drug prices, because these people who have crippling diseases, arthritis

04:20.680 --> 04:23.880
and such things, constantly are buying drugs.

04:23.880 --> 04:28.720
And your studies indicate that there has been an increase up to 1,000 percent, I guess,

04:28.720 --> 04:31.160
between the cost and the retail price.

04:31.160 --> 04:36.160
And they do appreciate our testimony as full of the indications.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.520
They do appreciate your efforts to do something for them to say.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
We appreciate your backing.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.400
I wish we could talk about more problems with that all the time.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.600
We have, thank you very much, Senator Pat McNamara.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.600
Thank you.
