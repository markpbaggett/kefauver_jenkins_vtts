This is Estes' key fover. I'm campaigning for the presidency. Today I would like to talk

00:06.620 --> 00:12.000
with you about corruption. We have been shocked and more than a little terrified by evidence

00:12.000 --> 00:17.480
of corruption at many levels of government in Washington, in some states, and in some

00:17.480 --> 00:24.960
cities. The situation must be cleaned up. Confidence in government must be fully restored.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.960
This must be made completely honest again. As president, I would make this my first

00:29.960 --> 00:34.640
order of business. Working together with the states and local governments and honest

00:34.640 --> 00:40.440
citizens everywhere, we can put the racketeers, the influence peddlers, and the petty chislers

00:40.440 --> 00:46.300
out of politics, out of government, and out of business altogether. We cannot face the

00:46.300 --> 00:51.560
perils of the future unless we have absolute integrity in our government. And we are going

00:51.560 --> 00:54.120
to have it. Thank you very much for listening.
