00:00.000 --> 00:09.200
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, two of the greatest things that ever happened

00:09.200 --> 00:14.920
to the rural people and to the people in the towns and cities of Tennessee was the Tennessee

00:14.920 --> 00:19.240
Valley Authority and the rural electrification administration.

00:19.240 --> 00:26.360
Well, back in 1939, when I first came to Congress, I met a fellow congressman, Plaid T. Ellis

00:26.360 --> 00:31.080
from the State of Arkansas and this to Ellis is with us here today.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.500
He is now the general manager of the National Rural Electric Association.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.600
And, Plaid, welcome to this program.

00:38.600 --> 00:45.000
I know that many Tennesseans who will be viewing it know you and certainly glad to have you

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
with us.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.960
I'm happy to be here with you, Estes, on the program.

00:48.960 --> 00:53.480
Plaid, I believe that the National Rural Electric Association had its annual convention

00:53.480 --> 00:56.520
at St. Louis last month, isn't that true?

00:56.520 --> 00:59.360
That is correct and of course many Tennesseans were there.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.840
Well, I want to congratulate you upon your good judgment on one thing.

01:02.840 --> 01:11.080
I have here the March Rural Electification Magazine and on the front page is Miss Joyce

01:11.080 --> 01:17.920
Adams of Clarksville, Tennessee, who is namely Rural Electric Queen for this year.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.480
Miss Rural Electification of 1960, that's right.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.480
Well, that was certainly a good choice.

01:22.480 --> 01:28.120
I wish you would bring Miss Adams up to Washington so we could all see her sometime and meet her.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.480
Let me say that she won at Fand Square and National Competition.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.840
She's deserving of the honor.

01:32.840 --> 01:36.680
Well, after seeing her picture, I can certainly see how she won.

01:36.680 --> 01:44.160
Well, I really think that since the days of Franklin Roosevelt and George Norris that you

01:44.160 --> 01:50.760
have done more to help the Rural Electification Program than anyone in the United States,

01:50.760 --> 01:52.280
tell us how the program is doing.

01:52.280 --> 01:59.320
A first, what was the situation back when R.E.A. started out and what is it now?

01:59.320 --> 02:06.120
In the South, generally, about 3% of the people in rural America, rural areas, had electricity.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.480
In the nation as a whole, about 10%.

02:09.480 --> 02:16.040
Today, it's about 96% of all farmers who have electricity, but we still have many of the

02:16.040 --> 02:18.040
same problems that we had then.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.800
Well, that's a great thing.

02:19.800 --> 02:24.720
We're losing a lot of people from our farms and young people, and I suppose if they didn't

02:24.720 --> 02:26.920
have electricity, we'd lose a whole lot more.

02:26.920 --> 02:27.920
Yes, sir.

02:27.920 --> 02:33.820
They're still leaving the farms by the hundreds of thousands every year, and this creates

02:33.820 --> 02:39.000
terrific problems for the rural electric cooperatives because they were required by Congress, Estes,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.200
as you know, to serve everybody.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.240
That was a social decision.

02:43.240 --> 02:49.160
Now when the farmers move away and leave those lines not paying any revenue, the rest of

02:49.160 --> 02:55.680
the folks, of course, have to make up the difference and have to pay Uncle Sam for not only

02:55.680 --> 03:00.760
what it costs to build their own lines, but the cost of those lines to serve farms that

03:00.760 --> 03:01.760
are now also.

03:01.760 --> 03:07.440
How many farms do you have lines in to now that have been vacated in the last few years?

03:07.440 --> 03:08.440
Roughly 400,000.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.000
Well, that really is a problem.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.440
Tell us about some of the problems of the R.E.A. throughout the nation right now in

03:14.440 --> 03:15.440
flying.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.720
We have two major problems.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.840
One of them is wholesale power supply, where we're going to get the power because the farmers

03:21.840 --> 03:28.920
are still doubling their use about every five to seven years, farmers and other rural people.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.920
So finding this power supply is difficult.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.640
About half of our power is purchased from the commercial companies in the Tennessee Valley

03:36.640 --> 03:41.720
country, 51 electric co-ops by all their power from TVA.

03:41.720 --> 03:47.400
The other big problem is capital to build our lines bigger all the time.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.720
When our flight is, you say, of us a social decision by the Congress that we wanted a

03:51.720 --> 03:58.240
electricity available to all the rural people whether they were distant or not, and a low

03:58.240 --> 03:59.760
interest rate was fixed.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.640
That's true.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.640
Half the people we serve today don't pay their own way.

04:04.640 --> 04:08.440
Congress knew that would be true when it required us to serve everybody, whether they could

04:08.440 --> 04:12.320
pay their own way or not, and that's why it fixed the 2% interest rate.

04:12.320 --> 04:16.200
We call it the 2% area coverage covenant.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.320
Well, as a matter of fact though, the government has never lost anything on an R.E.A. loan.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.320
Is that...

04:21.320 --> 04:22.320
Never a dime.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.320
To the rural electric co-op.

04:23.320 --> 04:27.200
What does the R.E.A. program mean to business in generally?

04:27.200 --> 04:30.720
How much is sold every year to farmers?

04:30.720 --> 04:36.720
Last year we did a survey in cooperation with American electrical industry in cooperation

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
with all...

04:37.720 --> 04:40.720
A billion dollars a year.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.280
That's a lot of business.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.280
In appliances.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.280
That's right.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.280
Thank you very much, Slade Ellis.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.280
That's all from now.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.800
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
