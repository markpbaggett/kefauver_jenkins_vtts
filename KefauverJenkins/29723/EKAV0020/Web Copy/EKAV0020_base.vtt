WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
This is the second telecast, bringing you the news from Washington, which I'm very

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
honored to present.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
And on this occasion, we are very happy to have with us the distinguished member of Congress

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
from Tennessee, from the fourth congressional district, the honorable Joe Evans.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Joe is beginning his eighth term as a member of the House of Representatives.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
He is a member of the Appropriations Committee.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
And I want to tell all of you people of Tennessee, not only of your fourth district, Joe,

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
but everyone that you are a very hardworking, effective member of the House of Representatives.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
And we certainly are glad to have you here.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
You're most generous, Estes.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
Well, Joe, I came up here in 1933 in March for the passage of the lame document to the inauguration

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
of President Roosevelt.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
And of course, we were all here during this current inauguration, and I haven't talked with you

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
people since then.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
During all of the snow and slush and the cold winds and most of us caught bad colds,

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
I don't think there has been as much enthusiasm or as large a crowd in spite of the cold weather

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
in town as there was for the Mr. Canada's inauguration.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes, it was a great outpouring of people's mall over the country, and we were certainly

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
privileged to have a great number of our friends from Tennessee.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
It was truly a great inaugural, a great occasion, and we lived through the snow.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
And we had three bands from Tennessee, and the other states just had one, so we got to...

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh, the edge on.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
...let me mention a couple of those outstanding bands from the fourth district of Tennessee,

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
from the University of South at Siwani, and also the Muffersboro Band.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
We were very proud of them.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
And then, he and I, won the draw, and they had a band and then Mars town.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I had promised the people at Mars town.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
It certainly they were very excellent band, but they invited to March in the parade.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
They won the National Honors last year, but they only wanted one from one state,

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
so I got Jigs Donahue, the parade chairman, let them march in place of the Virgin Isles,

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
which didn't send the band up here, but Tennessee played a big part.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
I had the feeling, Joe, that during inauguration and what's been happening since,

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
is quite similar to the situation in 1933, when President Roosevelt took over.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
Of course, there was a tremendous domestic recession and depression at that time.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
All is not well on the domestic front, but we don't have his bad situation.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
But we do have a grave international problems, and then, as now,

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
it was a time for great leadership, for affirmative action.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
And I think our president has been showing that in his inaugural address.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I mean, his message is to the Congress, don't you?

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Yes, yes, it is. The president delivered a great inaugural address,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
and I think all of us of the Congress have been impressed with the great speech

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
which he delivered before the joint section of the Congress,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
his first message on the state of the Union.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Well, Joe, I felt at this speech, he stated justice.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
He saw it without missing any words, without trying to cover over anything.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
The pictures he saw it today, economically.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
That is, that we have a lot of bad situations that we have to, but they're not hopeless.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
And that in the international affairs and among the nations of the world,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
we have lost some standing. There has been some deterioration, but there again,

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
with leadership, with sacrifice that we can bring about a better condition.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I thought it was a very forthright fine assessment.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
And after all, the American people ought to know exactly where we stand.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
Well, certainly he discussed domestic issues, but he greatly pointed up our troubles spots in the world

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
and indicated that America would not be second to any nation in power and strength.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
It was a message of security and national defense.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
The president has certainly has a precise mind and a factual knowledge of a grasp of things already.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
Today he's reaching through to the public and his views, offering a program to the Congress.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Well, I thought not only in the state of the Union message, as well as the inaugural message,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
it was not only what he had to say, but the force of which he delivered his speech,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
the dedication and the cheers you.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
And sincerity.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
As you know that the president, John F. Kennedy and I, were classmates together,

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
we came to Congress at the same time, and my classmates has now become president.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
In 1946.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
1946.

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
I was there with you in 1946 and 1947, and I came over to the Senate and your classmates joined us.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
And I remember that.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
At first session when you and I served together in the House, I didn't get to see you very much.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
You were campaigning for the Senate.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, you know, you have to do that sometimes.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, I have a feeling also that similar to what we had in 1933,

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
that we have a lot of new faces around, a lot of young people with vision.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
They call them a new frontier.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
A new frontier.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
And who was it that sang that song, said the country is on the best of hands?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Is that David Crocket?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Good of them.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
Well, I know that there are a lot of fine, capable young men and women who have come into government service

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
with great dedication, many of them making sacrifices.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
And I feel that by and large, Mr. Cavity has gotten very good men to advise and work with them.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Certainly, he has surrounded himself with some very evil men.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Even the former president has committed him on his selection of his cabinet,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
and said that he had been able to attract some of these very outstanding men.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And his assistance on any cabinet.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
One man who has been nominated is Joe Switler, who used to be General Counsel for the Tennessee Valley Authority

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
to be chairman of the Federal Power Commission.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
And the very significant selection, I was very pleased that the president selected him to become chairman.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And this is very important commission.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
He comes from Nashville, where he's been practicing law since he left the TVA.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
And I think he's a fair man. I think he's forceful.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I think he has a viewpoint of the consumer.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And believe me, we've been needing that viewpoint in the federal power.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Well, the landish reporter, as you know,

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
has decided the operation of the Federal Power Commission among all of the independent agencies

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
as the one who is least functioning properly in the public interest.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
In the last few years, it manages the Natural Gas Act and the granting of franchises

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
on the construction of great power dams throughout the nation.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
It's a very important commission.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And I think Mr. Switler will make a very excellent chairman.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
But Joe, of course, there have been a whole lot in the news the last few days

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
about the fight in the House of Representatives over the change in the rules committee.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
And you've been right there, where it's been taking place,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
where the fires have been going on.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
So tell us about what the shootings all of them are.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, as you know, at the beginning of each new session of the Congress,

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
both the House and the Senate adopt rules of procedure for their individual bodies.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
The House has already adopted for the 87th Congress the same rules of procedure

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
as were employed in the 86th Congress.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
But while adopting the same rules, we have been evaluated

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
and considering the operations of the committee,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
whether it has been read through the functioning,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
the real issue and the rules committee vote,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
was whether or not the elected representatives of all the people,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
the entire House should have a right to work its will,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
where they should have a right to vote on legislation,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
or where they're a very small group, or a handful,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
a very small minority.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
You both are 12.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Well, even in 2003, where their vote could tie up a legislation,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
it had been charges that bills have been pigeonholed,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
it has been a roadblock, and even vetoed.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
And certain legislation has not been permitted to reach the floor of the House.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Now, let us take a bill that has been debated for weeks and for months

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
before a standing legislative committee of the Congress.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
After the bill has been discussed, public hearings have been had,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
and a majority of the membership vote upon a bill,

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
then the function of the rules committee is to orderly proceed on to the floor

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
with measures for the House to debate and consider.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
If, historic...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I mean, the time and the day and...

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yes.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And the numbers of bills that will flow on to the floor,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
they schedule them as though traffic were to pass along.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
The rules committee is not supposed to be a dead end street,

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
it's supposed to be a committee to orderly permit legislation

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
to come on to the floor for debate and consideration.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Now, there has been instances of which maybe there are many bills that shouldn't pass.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
I know in the past I have voted for a rule to bring a bill on the floor to debate it,

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
which is democratic.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
It's certainly democratic to have a free discussion of a measure,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
even controversial measures.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
But then after the bill was debated, after it was possibly amended,

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
and made obnoxious, why I would vote against it on final passage.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
But the real issue is whether the full elected representatives

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
should have a right to debate and to vote upon legislation.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Of whether a few of very small minorities should block legislation

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
and deny the House the right to exercise its will.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Speaker Rayburn said,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
it's certainly the House, the elected representatives of the people,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
should have the right to vote upon legislation.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
The rules committee is not a committee on legislation,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
it's an administrative committee.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
It's an oral of the leadership, historically it goes with the leadership.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, Joe, we thank you very much for telling us what's about the issue.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
And certainly if we're going to get a new program over the entire membership

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
of the House of Representatives all they had to have a chance to vote.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, I'll be right down.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
My committee on appropriations has 50 members.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And the membership of this committee has been increased since I've been here.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
The rules committee used to be composed of five members.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Later it was nine.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
At another time there were 14.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And in the last few years they've settled on 12,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
which is an even number conducive to a tie vote, six to six.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So there have been a lot of tie votes.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And legislation is not reached the floor.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
So it's nothing unusual to change a committee of the Congress.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
As a matter of fact, we adopted a resolution allowing the speaker

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
and the minority leader to adjust the ratio of members of the committee.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
This committee has been composed of 12 members.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
Now it will be composed of 15 with three additions, two Democrats and one Republican.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
By the way, the speaker had just announced, as you know,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
the two new Democratic members of the committee.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
They are Congressman Carl Elliott of Alabama and BF Sisk of California.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
There are both of them I know in there, very substantial.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Very sound, man. Very good, man.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Well, then the President of the State of the Union message,

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
he, of course, couldn't go into details about all of the things he was going to do.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
And there were some little criticism on that part,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
but he's been acting very rapidly since that time.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
He's issued, for instance, an executive order

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
and expanding the surplus food distribution principally by,

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
and then also setting up food staff areas.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And I hope that we'll get one in Tennessee.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
I thought another very important thing he did was that the Community Facilities Program,

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
which has only been applicable to sewers and water districts and water and gas,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
has been expanded so as to be applicable to anything else.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
And, incidentally, Joe, I've introduced a bill to enlarge the Community Facilities Program,

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
so as to have a revolving fund of $1 billion to be loaned on worthwhile projects

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
at a rate of interest, one-fourth above what the government has to pay for its money.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
As to say, as a representative of a lot of our very excellent to small towns,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
I know that they have benefited from this program for municipal water works,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
sidewalks for libraries for hospital construction,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
and various municipal and community improvements.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Well, these are things that not only need to be done,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
they've been many improvements from the day they have a loan program.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
That's a loan program, but we paid by it.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Certainly given employment to a great many people.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
And also, we've been housing starts have been almost dried up,

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
so the president has lowered the interest rate by one quarter of a percent

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
or one-half a percent, no one-fourth of a percent,

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
on FHA home loans, which ought to help in that respect.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Then I think Joe that, um,

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
president was wise in following the suggestion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
and revoking the order about no dependence on having to be sent back.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
I think that by trying to get them to restrict travel,

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
tourism abroad, and to buy their capital equipment here in the United States.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Let me say, Esther said, I would certainly be for cutting down on some expenditures abroad,

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
but not at the expense of the American soldier and the American servicemen and their families.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Well, I was over the NATO parliamentarians conference shortly after this order went into effect,

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
and the effect on the morale of our soldiers was evident to be seen.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
There certainly must be other ways where the same result can be accomplished.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
But Joe, I want to tell you how good it is to have you over here with us,

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
and we are going to have a very exciting and I know a very useful session of Congress,

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
and I hope that one of these days we can get you back to join in reporting to the people of Tennessee.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Thank you.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
It's just you're very nice to invite me.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Ladies and gentlemen, until four weeks from today,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
when we will bring you another report, that's all.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Thank you very much.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Thank you.
