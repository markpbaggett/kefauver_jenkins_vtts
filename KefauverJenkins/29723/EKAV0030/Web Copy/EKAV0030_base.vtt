Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this is the first in our series of television

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
programs from Washington as to what is going on in the Congress of the United States.

00:12.000 --> 00:22.000
This program will be done every week and I will appreciate your comments about it and I want to thank the station very much for carrying this as a public service.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
We will try to be nonpartisan and objective in our discussion of what's happening in Congress and we will be bringing you

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
a guest on the program from time to time. I have on the program with me today a man that you'll be seeing a great deal of in the weeks to come.

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
I Charlie Callwell and I very handsome administrative assistant who is here and I'm glad to introduce you, Charlie. You've been introduced before.

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
I think the very good way to start this program today will be Charlie for you to ask some questions about them.

00:57.000 --> 01:06.000
Senator, I'd like to ask some questions. I understand that Congress got in the session here on Wednesday and how did it look up on the floor.

01:06.000 --> 01:18.000
Well Charlie, I've never seen anything like it. Whenever Congress comes back in the session, there's a whole lot of heading on another on the back, glad to see old friends, there's no acrimony everybody is friendly.

01:18.000 --> 01:28.000
And of course this year there was more handshaking I think than there has been before. That because of a number of people that are announced and unannounced candidates for president.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, the Senate is pretty full of either announced or unannounced candidates for the president.

01:34.000 --> 01:45.000
We have Senator Humphries who started first in our Senator Kennedy and of course there are quite a number of unannounced candidates who we all know about and then of course the vice president Nixon was there.

01:45.000 --> 01:56.000
And that's the then lay from time to time. I'm going to try to bring to you people of you listening on this station, the various candidates to express their views.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
I know that you'd like to hear from them. We'll bring Democrats and Republicans and try to keep it as nonpartisan as possible.

02:03.000 --> 02:14.000
But we got off to a very good start in the new Senate. We missed a Maggot Olfrenz Senator Langer who was the only member who had passed away since the last session.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And his successor was sworn in.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Senator, I'd like to ask you for comment on President Eisenhower's state of the Union message which was disconcluded.

02:23.000 --> 02:32.000
Well, first I want to say that President Eisenhower is looking very well indeed and certainly heartening to see him in good spirits and apparently a very fit physically.

02:32.000 --> 02:42.000
I thought his discussion of our international affairs was very fine indeed. He outlined our aims for peace, what was being done to try to attain those aims.

02:42.000 --> 02:51.000
He pointed out that some progress had been made, but that the intentions of Mr. Kruchev and the Russians was yet to be tested.

02:51.000 --> 03:06.000
But it would be tested as time went on. He also pointed out that we cannot be complacent that the best way to try to read some agreement for living together peacefully in the world was to be in a position of strength.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
He said that we had to keep up our defenses and he outlined terms about that.

03:12.000 --> 03:26.000
I made a whole lot of notes about what he had to say among other things he had to say was that it was very necessary that the non-committed underdeveloped nations of the world that they have a better chance.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
And that the nations of Western Europe were on their feet now to share in that effort.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
I've introduced a resolution sometime back after our NATO-Lund and conference to that effect as you have challenged.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
Well, what was your feeling about his domestic program? Well, I wasn't so happy about all parts of that.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
He first said that the agricultural program had been a failure as we all know but he didn't seem to have any remedy for it.

03:52.000 --> 04:00.000
We all in favor of a school construction program but I didn't know exactly how he was going to carry it out.

04:00.000 --> 04:12.000
And then I certainly agree that we ought to fight inflation all out. That budgetary responsibility is necessary but what we need also is to have more competition and prices.

04:12.000 --> 04:22.000
We need to stop this price of wage leapfrogging and I wasn't very satisfied with what he had to say about stopping inflation.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
Well, Senator, I think we'll try to get the presidential candidates on as guests as the program's gone in a few days.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, I wish we had more time to discuss this state of the union message but generally I thought it was a very good presentation.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
That's all the time we have now friends. Thank you until next week at this time.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Thank you.
