00:00.000 --> 00:16.400
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I am Estes Kefolver.

00:16.400 --> 00:21.800
I'm speaking to you from the NATO Parliamentary Conference in Paris France.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.400
This is a meeting of the delegates selected by the Congresses and

00:25.400 --> 00:28.800
the Parliament of the 15 NATO countries.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.800
I accepted appointment as a member of the United States delegation because I

00:32.800 --> 00:38.600
believe this meeting is of vital importance to our own safety at home and through

00:38.600 --> 00:45.200
the NATO organization and they are I offer to have solidarity among the

00:45.200 --> 00:50.800
nations of the North Atlantic, Western Europe and of the United States.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.600
As we have met here, two Sputniks have been constantly encircling the globe

00:54.600 --> 01:01.000
which reminds us of the scientific contest that we are engaged in today with

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
the Communist World and of the necessity of the people who believe in freedom, democracy,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.800
decency, joining together as closely as possible.

01:11.800 --> 01:17.400
Furthermore, in December just three weeks from now, the NATO Council, the heads of

01:17.400 --> 01:21.800
states will meet here in the same building in Paris France.

01:21.800 --> 01:26.200
And we feel that the suggestions and the work of the parliamentarians will be

01:26.200 --> 01:29.000
helpful in paving the way for them.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
I'm very proud to have with me today a very distinguished delegate, a member of

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
parliament from the United Kingdom, Mr. Jeffery, Jeffery Diffrater.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
Mr. Diffrater's, let me say, is one of the outstanding and great men in the

01:46.000 --> 01:51.200
parliament of our friend and our great friend and L.I.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
Great Britain.

01:52.200 --> 01:58.800
One of these days Mr. Diffrater's will probably be the secretary of air or the

01:58.800 --> 02:03.200
secretary of defense, he is a leading member of parliament.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.800
Mr. Diffrater's and I have had a pleasure of serving together on the so-called

02:07.800 --> 02:11.200
political committee of the NATO Parliamentary Association.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.200
His position is that of repertoire.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.200
Now that is a word that's not function is not used.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.800
We don't know much about it in the United States, but it means that he is the

02:23.800 --> 02:28.600
chief man on the committee that he prepares the report and he prepared an excellent

02:28.600 --> 02:34.200
political report that he gets the consensus of opinion about the resolutions and

02:34.200 --> 02:39.600
the proposals to be made that he then grabs the proposals and he takes the lead

02:40.600 --> 02:47.600
and has done it splendidly when they proposals are the resolutions come before the general session

02:47.600 --> 02:50.600
of the NATO Parliamentary Conference.

02:50.600 --> 02:56.600
And it's been very remarkable that all of our resolutions were accepted unanimously

02:56.600 --> 03:02.600
and that's due to great extent to the fine draftsmanship and explanations

03:02.600 --> 03:08.600
and to the standing and influence of my friend here, Mr. Diffrater's.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.600
Certainly, I'm happy to have you on this program, Jeffrey.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.600
Thank you very much, Sherwin.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.600
Let me ask, are you...

03:18.600 --> 03:22.600
Ben to the United States a great deal and yes, I have.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.600
I've actually been in 47 out of the 48 states.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.600
Well, then I know if you've been in 47 out of the 48, you must have been through the

03:29.600 --> 03:31.600
great parliamentary state of Tennessee.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
I have.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.600
I wouldn't have died coming this program if I'd been there.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.600
That's the one I'd missed.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.600
And when was it you were there, Jeffrey in Tennessee?

03:40.600 --> 03:43.600
Well, in Tennessee, that was 1935.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.600
It must have been a very, very young man at that time.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.600
Well, I was studying at Yale at the time and so I had a look at the south.

03:50.600 --> 03:55.600
Well, I went to school at Yale and I'm not saying I'm much of a study, but...

03:55.600 --> 04:01.600
And I thank you, also married a very lovely American girl.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.600
I did, sir.

04:02.600 --> 04:08.600
So we have a lot in common and we certainly are happy to have Mr. Fredas as our guest today.

04:08.600 --> 04:14.600
Will you tell us what you think about the work of the conference and the importance of the conference, Jeffrey?

04:14.600 --> 04:22.600
Well, one of the most important features was the fact that Senator Keifer was elected chairman of the political committee,

04:22.600 --> 04:24.600
the committee he's referred to.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.600
You see, before you go off...

04:25.600 --> 04:29.600
Yeah, I wanted to just tell the friends in Tennessee that I didn't put you up to...

04:30.600 --> 04:32.600
I know that, but you...

04:32.600 --> 04:36.600
Rather, build me up a little bit by saying I was the most important man in the committee.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.600
I just wanted to make it...

04:38.600 --> 04:43.600
Senator Keifer was elected chairman by the 15 countries and it's true, I was rapporteur.

04:43.600 --> 04:53.600
But that meant to see that as rapporteur this committee, I had to work very first to with the chairman, so I've seen a good deal of you I have,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.600
I've read it during the last few days.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.600
I think the most important point that we've done is to...

04:58.600 --> 05:08.600
One of the most important things we've decided was to accept the resolution looking right ahead to the conference,

05:08.600 --> 05:15.600
governmental conference, to study the Atlantic community and what it really was based on.

05:15.600 --> 05:21.600
Well, Jeffrey, in that connection we have our political committee reported two resolutions.

05:21.600 --> 05:33.600
First was to have this NATO parliamentary association be the nucleus around which a great citizens congress would be held in 1959,

05:33.600 --> 05:38.600
the 10th anniversary of the NATO treaty, the North Atlantic treaty.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.600
This would be in the nature of a hate conference, I believe.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.600
You tell us how you envisioned it.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.600
Yeah, it's a great conference.

05:46.600 --> 05:52.600
In 1959 being the anniversary of 10th anniversary, we'd have a...

05:52.600 --> 06:03.600
get together of all people representing institutions, organizations, and so on, who are interested in bringing the countries around the Atlantic closer together.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.600
And they would have a discuss it.

06:06.600 --> 06:11.600
Ten years ago there was a similar conference in Europe and it had a great...

06:11.600 --> 06:16.600
that had a great results in making European nations realize how much they had in common.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
And that's very important.

06:17.600 --> 06:24.600
I believe the hate conference in 1948, which Mr. Churchill and the great minister of distinguished Europeans,

06:24.600 --> 06:32.600
were present and spoke, resulted in the trustworthy creation of the Council of Europe and many other very worthwhile things

06:32.600 --> 06:35.600
that have been done to bring the European community together.

06:35.600 --> 06:42.600
Yes, it did. And that Council of Europe has provided twice a year the opportunity for members of parliament

06:42.600 --> 06:45.600
to different countries in Europe to meet and discuss common problems.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.600
They don't, they can't take any executive action, but they can add different points of view.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
And that's a enormous importance.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.600
Yes, it is.

06:53.600 --> 06:59.600
And I think we also envision this hate conference on the 10th anniversary of the North Atlantic treaty

07:00.600 --> 07:08.600
to be a time for people back home to talk about and think about and study NATO problems,

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600
the problems of the Atlantic community.

07:10.600 --> 07:17.600
Because we realize that NATO will only be as strong and as effective as it has backing from the people.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.600
And this will be a time of mobilization of that public backing.

07:21.600 --> 07:28.600
The other part of this very important resolution is something that I've been working on.

07:29.600 --> 07:35.600
For a long, long time in the Congress of the United States, or similar to it.

07:35.600 --> 07:44.600
And that is to set up a conference or a commission, the delegates of which would be selected by the respective 15 governments of NATO,

07:44.600 --> 07:57.600
to seriously study and to recommend ways and means of implementing and the NATO idea of bringing about better cooperation, unity,

07:58.600 --> 08:01.600
among the nations of the North Atlantic.

08:01.600 --> 08:08.600
I'm very hopeful at the meeting here in December that President Eisenhower and the other heads of state

08:08.600 --> 08:10.600
may implement this resolution.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.600
What do you think about this general idea?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.600
I think it's a statement.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.600
I think the two of them are fitting very well.

08:16.600 --> 08:21.600
One is the big Congress and this other one.

08:21.600 --> 08:30.600
I believe that the government's meeting next month, when everyone is well aware of the importance of NATO and this alliance,

08:30.600 --> 08:33.600
that they will go forward and set up such a conference.

08:33.600 --> 08:40.600
It was seem to me that in a three-day meeting such as this will be three weeks from now with heads of government here,

08:40.600 --> 08:49.600
that they can only agree upon general principles that the implementation that details will have to be worked out by commission

08:49.600 --> 08:56.600
or conference and this recommendation, I hope, will fit what they may do at that time.

08:56.600 --> 09:01.600
And I know that there's no harm at least from talking things over.

09:01.600 --> 09:15.600
Jeffrey, we had one estimate and the conference, an unfortunate one, growing out of the decision of the United Kingdom and the United States to send arms to the nation of Tunisia.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.600
Will you tell us what happened here next?

09:18.600 --> 09:33.600
Well, we're in France and you only have to be here to realize how extremely touchy the French are about anything that appears to be helping the nationalists in Algeria.

09:33.600 --> 09:43.600
And of course, this has been construed in the way that the legs that armed foot go from Tunisia into Algeria.

09:43.600 --> 09:49.600
And of course, the emotions are very charged off for all the French-Hair people, fighting where they are and being killed out.

09:49.600 --> 10:04.600
And one manifestation of it was that the French, the irrigation here, all the French members of Parliament, as a protest against the action of the two governments, the British and the American, left the conference, walked right out.

10:04.600 --> 10:10.600
It's my opinion to the silly thing to do because you've gained nothing by walking out, but just not there to put your point of view.

10:10.600 --> 10:22.600
Yes, well, I certainly agree that walking out doesn't do any good. And as you say, there can be more effective if they stay in the meeting and present their point of view.

10:22.600 --> 10:28.600
And I think it's fair to say that there's a great deal of sympathy with the French position.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.600
I can certainly understand how they feel about it.

10:31.600 --> 10:51.600
I believe that one thing that was not done in this connection, and I think this was a mistake not to have done it, was that the members of NATO, the NATO Ministerial Council, and Mr. Paul Enres, Bob, the Secretary General of NATO, was not informed.

10:51.600 --> 11:12.600
There was no consultation between the members, so that this is one of those things that disrupted our unity, and it should have been discussed all the way around the NATO Ministerial Group before any action was taken because France is a great and precious friend of the United States and the United Kingdom.

11:12.600 --> 11:24.600
We don't want anything to happen that's going to permanently disrupt Sharia or cause a disunity with France. We certainly hope they will come back in the conference.

11:24.600 --> 11:37.600
And I hope that in the future that our State Department may handle matters differently. I doubt very much the wisdom of what they did, but certainly the way they did it was bad.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.600
By the way, will you tell us some of the other outstanding achievements of this conference?

11:41.600 --> 11:51.600
On that very point, of course, our committee offered a resolution, which was accepted, due to the unanimous status of the parliament, just this morning, on this very matter.

11:51.600 --> 11:56.600
That is to say the importance, stressing the importance of consultation between the nations.

11:56.600 --> 12:01.600
And then, well, the scientific point, I think that's an important one.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.600
Yes, but why don't you say a word about the scientific?

12:03.600 --> 12:12.600
Well, it's just that we've all, we've accepted the resolution of the big deal of pooling of scientific and technical manpower among the NATO countries.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.600
The general principle is that it's up to us to implement it.

12:15.600 --> 12:22.600
That was really an implementation of what President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Macmillan agreed upon in Washington sometime back.

12:22.600 --> 12:30.600
And that report incident was presented by Senator Henry Jackson from the State of Washington, who was a great friend of us in Tennessee.

12:30.600 --> 12:37.600
Well, Jeffrey, this is about all the time we have. We want to extend you a welcome to come down to our state.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.600
We hope you will come down and see the Tennessee Valley Authority again, like you.

12:42.600 --> 12:47.600
And we'll be very happy to see you and it's been a great pleasure to be on this program.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.600
Thanks very much.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.600
That's all.
