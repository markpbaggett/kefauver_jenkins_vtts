00:00.000 --> 00:09.040
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we have with us today, Mr. Bob Kor, who is

00:09.040 --> 00:14.600
the director of our radio and TV studio here in the United States Senate.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.040
Bob, it's certain who's going to ask me some questions.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.040
Certainly, it was good to have you with us.

00:19.040 --> 00:23.560
Well, Senator, it's been a long time since I've had the privilege of being on a program

00:23.560 --> 00:25.520
with you almost since 1940, I think.

00:25.680 --> 00:31.480
Well, Bob, I think we started back in the House of Representatives days making a plighter.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.480
That's right, Senator.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.080
Talk about 1940.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.360
The Cherry Blossom Week is...

00:35.360 --> 00:39.600
Bob and Helen have been here directing us and helping us ever since.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.480
Cherry Blossom Week, though, Senator, is still like it was back in 1940.

00:43.480 --> 00:48.440
Cherry Blossoms were a few days late this year, but I did notice that there were a lot of school buses

00:48.440 --> 00:52.440
with Tennessee license plates on them, and I'm wondering just why are you here in Washington

00:52.440 --> 00:54.360
when most of the senators are back home?

00:54.400 --> 00:57.480
Well, Bob, it is too bad the Cherry Blossoms were a little late.

00:57.480 --> 01:04.000
We had the festival last Friday and Saturday, Joanna Evans, you know, Congressman Evans's daughter

01:04.000 --> 01:06.520
was Tennessee princess.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.360
We didn't have a single Cherry Blossom, then Sunday the sunshine came out and Monday and Tuesday

01:11.360 --> 01:14.200
we had beautiful Cherry Blossoms.

01:14.200 --> 01:20.200
But about these Tennessee school children, many of the high schools in Tennessee have a senior...

01:21.200 --> 01:26.520
have their annual senior class trip come up to Washington, and I think this week we've had seven

01:26.520 --> 01:28.000
or eight classes here.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.800
Well, now, Senator, just what do you do for these school children?

01:30.800 --> 01:34.040
Are they just stopping to say hello or do you perform a service for them?

01:34.040 --> 01:36.880
Well, I hope that we perform a service.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.880
They usually come by the office and we give them passes to the Senate.

01:40.880 --> 01:46.120
I have a little guidebook about what to see in Washington, and I show them my pictures

01:46.120 --> 01:48.480
and little mementos in my office.

01:48.560 --> 01:53.560
And then, usually we go down in front of the Capitol or on the back of the Capitol now

01:53.560 --> 01:57.800
since the front is torn up and have a class picture made.

01:57.800 --> 02:04.080
It's one of the very pleasant parts about service up here, seeing these school kids.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.040
They all say that they know a whole lot more about government, about White House,

02:08.040 --> 02:11.520
about Congress after they've been here than they did before they came.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.920
Now, let's leave the more pleasant things and get into the more prosaic matters.

02:16.320 --> 02:21.640
You're a chairman of the subcommittee, and he trusts the subcommittee.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.400
And you have currently been holding hearings.

02:24.400 --> 02:29.720
Most of your hearings, as I've been following them in the press, have been directed to,

02:29.720 --> 02:33.920
I guess I should call it a cartel of large drug manufacturers

02:33.920 --> 02:38.640
who have been, according to material you bought out, overcharging the public

02:38.640 --> 02:44.760
and making tremendous profits on certain drugs which are helpful to our sick and our ailing.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.520
I wonder if you could give us a little background of that.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.080
Well, I wouldn't call it a cartel, Bob.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.800
Our antitrust and not-the-subcommittee is charged with investigating

02:54.800 --> 02:58.680
lack of competition and great many industries.

02:58.680 --> 03:05.000
Steel and bread and others, but I think our drug industry has attracted more attention.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.600
What we found is that the medical profession and the pharmaceutical manufacturers

03:09.600 --> 03:14.240
have played an important part in this have developed a wonderful medicine.

03:14.240 --> 03:19.680
There's wondered drugs that keep people alive and give them better health in the last few years.

03:19.680 --> 03:25.200
But the sad fact is that in many cases, many of these drugs are beyond the reach

03:25.200 --> 03:29.560
of pocketbook wise of the average person who is sick.

03:29.560 --> 03:34.000
So what we are investigating is why are the prices so high?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.560
Why isn't there a price competition between the large companies?

03:37.560 --> 03:38.440
What do you think?

03:39.400 --> 03:46.480
Well, we found that there is not a price competition among large companies

03:46.480 --> 03:49.080
on most of these ethical drugs.

03:49.080 --> 03:55.200
We found also that their profit of the drug manufacturers is about twice the average

03:55.200 --> 03:58.440
of the average manufacturing company in the United States.

03:58.440 --> 04:05.400
And on net worth, for the last few years, has been the highest, about 22% after taxes.

04:05.400 --> 04:13.200
We found also that they sell to the pharmacist for very much larger price than the sell to the government

04:13.200 --> 04:14.480
when they bid to the government.

04:14.480 --> 04:25.240
In one case, they sell to the pharmacist $180 worth and the government would buy for the same thing for $30.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.880
Well, now, Senator, the pharmacist is not the blame for these ideas.

04:27.880 --> 04:33.760
No, the pharmacist is, he only adds his profit on what the manufacturer charges them.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.320
And he's entitled to make a reasonable profit.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.800
And he's not the one to blame.

04:37.800 --> 04:41.120
And he's interested in getting the prices down just like we are.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.880
Well, Senator, I wish we had more time.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.320
It's more than a price money.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.320
Thank you very much.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.320
Thank you, sir.
