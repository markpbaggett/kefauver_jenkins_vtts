00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee. This is a very exciting week in Washington because

00:08.880 --> 00:14.280
this is a cherry blossom week. The Tennessee State Society of Washington, its president

00:14.280 --> 00:22.680
and officers and members, chose the Tennessee cherry blossom princess who is with us today.

00:22.680 --> 00:29.040
Miss Joanna Evans, I'll Smithville-Tumsee, and it certainly is wonderful to have you with us,

00:29.040 --> 00:36.360
Joanna. And we are also honored in having her distinguished father, Congressman Joe Evans,

00:36.360 --> 00:42.040
of a fourth congressional district who has been serving in the House of Representatives for

00:42.040 --> 00:47.280
almost 14 years with great honor and dignity. Well, thank you, Ed. It's nice to be here and

00:47.280 --> 00:50.280
to bring Joanna along. I certainly appreciate you bringing it.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.560
Joanna, tell us about the, you go to Vanderbilt that way, don't you?

00:55.560 --> 00:57.080
Sure.

00:57.080 --> 01:03.960
And I hear you're a very outstanding student. You make wonderful grades and I can

01:03.960 --> 01:09.280
reprove that by you, Joe. She's always made better grades than me.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.480
Joanna, you're a junior at Vanderbilt.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.480
Miss Joanna?

01:13.480 --> 01:17.280
Here you're president of the E.O.P.S. authority for next year.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.680
The next year, yes sir.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.680
I have a daughter at Vanderbilt and I have that link.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.680
I know you don't. Who else is now? Little Fister.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.680
Well, she's not even proud of you.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.680
Here, go ahead.

01:29.680 --> 01:34.920
Well, friends, when Miss Joanna Evans came to Washington, on Sunday nights, he was met

01:34.920 --> 01:41.080
by the president of the Tennessee State Society, a large group of Tennesseeans, in honor

01:41.080 --> 01:45.440
of our beautiful charming chair blossom princess at Tennessee.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.440
Now tell us what the program's been this week, Joanna.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.440
Well, the meeting was the most spectacular.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.440
At the plane, I wasn't very charming. I had rained in my face and everybody had umbrellas

01:54.440 --> 01:58.680
and the cameras were all over. And the next day, we met our escorts through the

01:58.680 --> 02:00.680
Univac machine.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.680
As I was on Monday.

02:02.680 --> 02:03.680
On Monday, yes.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
And you've been very busy all week.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
Oh, very.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.680
And then what happened on Tuesday, Joanna?

02:08.680 --> 02:14.960
On Tuesday, we had, tell you, the official opening of the Festival, the lining of the

02:14.960 --> 02:18.320
Japanese stone lantern about the ambassador to the stutter.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.320
About the ambassador of Japan?

02:19.320 --> 02:20.320
That's a pain.

02:20.320 --> 02:26.320
And then on Wednesday night, I believe, we're choosing you had a great ball with all

02:26.320 --> 02:27.320
of your escorts.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
We've seen eye.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.640
Tennis at the state societies of all of the countries, states.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.640
And then the official crowning of the Queen is on Friday night.

02:37.640 --> 02:38.640
No, I did not.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.640
Turn the oil.

02:39.640 --> 02:47.240
And I'd explain that if Merritt went in exclusively in choosing, I'm sure that Joanna would be

02:47.240 --> 02:52.440
the Queen of the overall Queen of the Cherublos and Festival, but they turn the wheel in.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.680
That's not that you can be prejudiced like that.

02:54.680 --> 03:00.040
And we hope that the wheel will end in the right place and that Joanna will be the national

03:00.040 --> 03:01.040
Queen.

03:01.040 --> 03:06.040
And then Joanna, you're going back to Nashville and to Vanderbilt.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.040
Let me mind you, too.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
A lot of work.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
I'm afraid.

03:09.040 --> 03:16.280
And, Joe, this is a great week for you and Anne.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.520
Yes, just we're delighted to have Joanna with us.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.360
We are very honored that the society has selected her, but most of all, we've enjoyed having

03:22.360 --> 03:23.360
the week visit with her.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.000
And I understand just smart her, Brent Fowler, may be coming up to.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.320
Well, he always likes to make trips, but he couldn't make this one.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.600
He decided not to come this time.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.440
We're very sorry that he didn't come.

03:33.440 --> 03:38.040
But Joanna, you have a plan student of French, too, aren't you?

03:38.040 --> 03:39.040
I'm studying it.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.040
Could you go to France last year?

03:41.040 --> 03:45.040
Yes, 13th of summer when it's France and the States and the French family.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.040
I enjoy it very much.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.040
And what are you going to do this summer, Joanna?

03:49.040 --> 03:51.040
Oh, because they haven't worked this summer.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.040
You mean your father's going to make you work this summer?

03:54.040 --> 03:57.040
But he made it work before we went.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.040
What are you going to be doing this summer, Joe?

03:59.040 --> 04:00.840
Well, she has lots of interest.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.040
She likes newspaper work, if she can find a place where she might get a job with a newspaper,

04:05.040 --> 04:07.040
that's what her interests are in writing.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.040
But I suspect you'll be campaigning for me.

04:09.040 --> 04:14.400
Well, Joe, you don't have any opposition, so you will need it if you're ready to campaign

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
for you.

04:15.400 --> 04:20.640
Well, Joanna, certainly is a wonderful view to come and be with us and all the Tennessee

04:20.640 --> 04:22.640
and some mighty, mighty proud of you.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.640
Thank you.

04:23.640 --> 04:27.440
And we in the Tennessee delegation feel that you're a lovely queen.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.440
And we hope that you'll be the national queen because you deserve to be.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.440
Thanks, Joanna.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.440
Thank you very much, Joanna.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.440
Thank you very much, Joe, for coming and thank you and with us.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.440
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.440
Thank you.
