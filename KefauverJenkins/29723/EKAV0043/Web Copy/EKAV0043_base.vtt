00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, during the many years that I served on the

00:06.200 --> 00:12.960
Armed Services Committee in the Senate, I gained great respect as a statesman, as a very

00:12.960 --> 00:18.760
fine public servant, and as one of our great engineers and scientists, a trevary gardener

00:18.760 --> 00:24.000
who was an assistant secretary of the Air Force in charge of research and development.

00:24.560 --> 00:29.480
That is all of the atomic programs and the missile programs came under him.

00:29.480 --> 00:35.320
Mr. Gardner is now the head of the TACON Manufacturing Company at Pasadena, California.

00:35.320 --> 00:40.320
He has a great deal of information about atomic energy and knowledge about missiles, and

00:40.320 --> 00:45.920
he's able to, and he follows with great interest the disarmament conferences that are going

00:45.920 --> 00:46.920
on.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.520
Certainly, it's good to have you with us, sir.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.720
Mr. Gardner, I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.

00:52.720 --> 01:00.400
The ten nation, ten power disarmament conference started at Geneva on Tuesday, I believe.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.880
And what is all this about?

01:01.880 --> 01:06.640
What do you think can be discussed and what is the necessity of talking about disarmament

01:06.640 --> 01:08.640
present time?

01:08.640 --> 01:16.520
Well, this is a continuation of the 14 years of negotiations that have proceeded this conference

01:16.520 --> 01:20.560
in the United Nations on disarmament.

01:20.560 --> 01:24.920
These negotiations have up till now been fruitless.

01:24.920 --> 01:31.440
The present attempts, I feel, it's highly urgent that some kind of an agreement be reached

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
with the Russians, particularly.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.240
And what makes you feel that way?

01:35.240 --> 01:36.760
Particularly about what now?

01:36.760 --> 01:40.240
Particularly in regard to suspension of nuclear tests.

01:40.240 --> 01:48.680
I feel that we've got to bring some sort of control over the nuclear testing problem

01:48.680 --> 01:54.840
before nuclear know-how spreads throughout the world.

01:54.840 --> 02:00.560
And before too many nations have nuclear weapons so that agreements become a literally

02:00.560 --> 02:01.560
impossible.

02:01.560 --> 02:08.480
As it stands now, we, the Soviet Union, England, and now France have nuclear weapons, and

02:08.480 --> 02:12.160
do you think that other nations will have it, have them before too long?

02:12.160 --> 02:20.880
Yes, I think it's highly alarming that additional nations are getting nuclear capability, nuclear

02:20.880 --> 02:25.280
weapons capability, as time goes on.

02:25.280 --> 02:32.560
It's not too difficult to project that perhaps communist China might be the next nation to

02:32.560 --> 02:34.800
detonate a nuclear device.

02:35.440 --> 02:43.000
If they should do this, I think it is extremely serious, as a matter of fact, it is extremely

02:43.000 --> 02:47.680
serious, if the nuclear club, as it's called, becomes any larger.

02:47.680 --> 02:53.680
Because even today, with Russia and the US possessing nuclear weapons and the power to

02:53.680 --> 03:03.000
deliver them, the possibility of an irrational act or an unexpected act or an accident, triggering

03:03.000 --> 03:08.200
a nuclear war that would annihilate the world, is frightening.

03:08.200 --> 03:17.840
It's a much greater risk than the risk involved in resulting from arriving at test suspension

03:17.840 --> 03:18.840
agreements.

03:18.840 --> 03:27.520
Well, Trivore, do you think that we can have sufficient inspection to enter into an agreement

03:27.520 --> 03:28.520
of this kind?

03:28.600 --> 03:33.400
Yes, our country has been quite ambivalent on this point.

03:33.400 --> 03:44.440
We have, on the one hand, said to the Russians that we would agree to spacing of a thousand

03:44.440 --> 03:50.800
miles on stations for inspections and then quickly re-reversed ourselves.

03:50.800 --> 03:56.760
We believe that many scientists join me, I think, in this, that it is possible with a spacing

03:56.840 --> 04:05.640
of about 250 miles on inspection stations to detect even small nuclear tests.

04:05.640 --> 04:11.040
And therefore, the risk of a violation of a nuclear test suspension ban becomes quite

04:11.040 --> 04:12.040
small.

04:12.040 --> 04:19.240
I think there's another point here, and that is that it is necessary for the violating

04:19.240 --> 04:24.840
nation not only to think about the benefit they get from the violation, but the danger

04:24.840 --> 04:28.200
involved if they are quite cheating.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.400
Yes, well, I wish very much we could go on with this because this is one of the most important

04:32.400 --> 04:35.080
conferences that we've had in a long time.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.920
We hope there will be some success.

04:36.920 --> 04:41.520
Thank you very much, Mr. Gardner, and we hope to have you back again on our program.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.000
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.
