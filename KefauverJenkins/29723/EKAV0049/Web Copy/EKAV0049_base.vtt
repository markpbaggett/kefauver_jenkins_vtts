00:00.000 --> 00:23.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee. I'm a very flattered and honored to have one of my best friends in the Senate with us today.

00:23.000 --> 00:33.000
He's a very popular and able member of the United States Senate from the second largest state in the Union, the state of Texas, Ralph Yarbrough.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
And thank you very much Ralph for coming and being with me on this program.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Senator Keith Oliver, thank you for this invitation. This is a real honor to be on this program.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Many people came to Texas from Tennessee and from many other states. My grandfather was born in that great volunteer state.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
And of course you represented the Democratic Party in all the states of the Union and we're grateful for the help you've given us in Texas.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
If your speeches for the Democratic Party, you know that's not a nice, we're mighted proud of all the Texans who came from Tennessee.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
And I know that your grandfather was a born up in Cumberland County, I think, and lived up there, didn't he Ralph?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Right up somewhere in the northern part, the central part of it, northern Tennessee.

01:16.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, I had the pleasure of being a co-sponsor of a bill at Senator Yarbrough. I took the leadership in and worked through the committee and passed on the floor of the Senate this week, a very important bill called the Cool War GI.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
The bill of rights. And I want you to explain about the bill, will you?

01:40.000 --> 01:50.000
First, Senator Keith Oliver, thank you for being a co-sponsor and adding your influence and making that very able argument for the bill on the floor of the Senate that helps so much in its passage.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
This bill is to continue the, basically, the benefits of the Korean War bill to the veterans of the Cold War.

01:57.000 --> 02:12.000
That is the period since January 1955 until the draft ends in 1963. And it provides for educational and vocational educational opportunities for these veterans for loans on homes and farms.

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
But it does not have mustering out pay and does not have business loans. A lot of the veterans organizations felt it shouldn't be as broad as the conflict period.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
It's not as broad, but it does carry the educational opportunities.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
Well, I think the GI bill of rights was one of the best pieces of legislation that Congress passed.

02:31.000 --> 02:43.000
In Tennessee, more than 200,000 young men and women took advantage of it, getting education, also buying a home and buying a farm.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
And this extends some of the benefits to those who are serving since 1955, isn't that correct?

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
That's correct. As long as they draft runs until 1963, they'll have an opportunity to go to college where they've been in service.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
And that's 45% of the young men who are better in their service.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
How many would be eligible for benefits under this bill?

03:04.000 --> 03:13.000
Four million will be eligible about half will take them. The experience of World War II and the Korean conflict is that only 50% of the veterans go to school under the belt.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
Four million will be eligible. We should have two million more and will raise the educational level of our people with the law.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
I think that about 93,000 will be eligible in the state of Tennessee under this new program.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
And I know it'll mean a whole lot to these young men.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
Now, Senator Long had an amendment which was adopted to your bill, Senator Yarber. Will you tell what that was?

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Well, the opposition to the Democratic Party wanted to make this wholly alone program.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Senator Long had a compromise proposal.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
At sub-college level, high school and vocational education is still a grant.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
The first year in college will be a grant program. But if the student falls in the bottom 50% of his class, then it'll have to borrow money.

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
But if it can raise his grades as long as it stays in the top 50% of his class in college, it would be a grant by the government.

04:03.000 --> 04:13.000
And as I understand this would last for three years as a maximum amount that anybody can get under the program.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
That's correct, Senator McKeef, already got to go to school a day and a half each day of service, but not over three years of education.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Now, how about the home and farm loan provisions of the bill?

04:24.000 --> 04:32.000
That is to permit them to make direct loans just like the Korean and the World War II veterans to have a direct loan for a home or a farm.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Particularly helpful in the rural areas, this old and credit for farm home.

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
Senator Yarlborough, I want to congratulate you upon the leadership you have finished and presenting this bill and getting it passed in the Senate.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
And certainly good to have you with us.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Thank you for this opportunity.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
That's all, and thank you for your help.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Thank you very much.
