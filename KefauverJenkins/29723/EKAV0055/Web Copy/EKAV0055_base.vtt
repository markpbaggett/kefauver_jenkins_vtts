00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, a very important item of business before

00:10.480 --> 00:13.960
the Senate this week was the mutual security bill.

00:13.960 --> 00:20.120
The President asked the Congress for $4175 million and funds to continue the efforts of

00:20.120 --> 00:25.600
the United States, in aiding the free friendly nations of the world to maintain their strength

00:25.600 --> 00:27.920
and growth in the face of communist Russia.

00:27.920 --> 00:32.600
And I may say in this connection that the President feels that this is the most important

00:32.600 --> 00:37.840
bill before the Congress for the security of the United States and of the free world.

00:37.840 --> 00:44.280
Rather than it passed the bill which calls for $4125 million, a reduction of $20 million

00:44.280 --> 00:50.320
under the President's request, among many amendments offered were two which I voted for.

00:50.320 --> 00:55.240
The first of these calls on the Arab Republic to observe freedom of the seas and the administration

00:55.240 --> 00:57.240
of the Suez Canal.

00:57.240 --> 01:01.820
All nations are affected by this amendment, although the primary need for the provision

01:01.820 --> 01:07.200
was the recent denial of passage to ships of the Israeli Republic.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.060
I do not believe use of this international waterway should be denied to any nation and

01:12.060 --> 01:17.680
was led to take my stand with many of my colleagues in the Senate in favor of this amendment.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.560
And this is the position incidentally that's been taken by the United Nations General Assembly.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.560
Another amendment I for which I voted was defeated, I'm sorry to say.

01:27.560 --> 01:33.840
It called for a reduction of some $200 million in the military aid funds to foreign nations.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.960
It has been my view for a number of years at the success of the free nations and their

01:37.960 --> 01:40.680
striving for strength and peace.

01:40.680 --> 01:47.040
Can best be served in most instances by economic aid rather than pure military aid.

01:47.040 --> 01:52.320
I felt for some time at building up the economic sounds and growth of these nations with technical

01:52.320 --> 01:59.560
systems and other ways we are trying to help make them better bashtons against communism

01:59.560 --> 02:02.800
than just by sending them tanks and guns.

02:02.800 --> 02:08.040
It is for this reason that I have sponsored a resolution in Congress calling for a review

02:08.040 --> 02:15.960
of the NATO nations, many programs of economic aid to underdeveloped and uncommitted nations.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.120
Coordination of our efforts along these lines will do much.

02:19.120 --> 02:23.440
I believe to reduce duplication and to eliminate waste.

02:23.440 --> 02:29.040
It will also go a long way toward more sharing of the expense burden by channeling aid from

02:29.040 --> 02:35.480
other allies into the areas where we must win friends and keep them in the coal war.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.600
And unfortunately continues relentlessly.

02:38.600 --> 02:43.360
In summation I would like to make this observation about the mutual security program and what

02:43.360 --> 02:45.160
it stands for.

02:45.160 --> 02:49.040
There are some who will say that it is purely a foreign giveaway.

02:49.040 --> 02:54.240
There are others who will in the name of waste seek to put an end to this vital program.

02:54.240 --> 03:00.160
I think the most charitable thing that can be placed on such views is to say that they

03:00.160 --> 03:02.360
are not fully enlightened.

03:02.360 --> 03:07.000
I believe that such views must spring from either blandness to the facts of life in the

03:07.000 --> 03:11.560
world today or from a failure to face these facts.

03:11.560 --> 03:15.960
I agree that there have been many instances of waste and many of our programs.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.200
And we must eliminate these wherever we can.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.920
But we do not cut off our hand to cure an infected finger.

03:22.920 --> 03:27.120
And we cannot afford to forget that missiles and science have turned thousands of miles

03:27.120 --> 03:30.680
into minutes in 1960.

03:30.680 --> 03:35.920
And have made next door neighbors out of people's tens of thousands of miles away.

03:35.920 --> 03:40.560
Our global neighbors include friends and foes and many thousands of people who have made

03:40.560 --> 03:43.000
no commitments to either side.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Our own security in our very living rooms here at home depends upon finding the answers

03:48.000 --> 03:53.080
to the security of our friends who stand with us against Russia.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.560
Mutual security is not an idle phrase.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.560
It is not a foreign giveaway.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.960
It is I assure you life and death to all of us.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.520
And we must continue to support it and to fight for it against those who would cut it to

04:05.520 --> 04:06.840
ribbons.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.920
In these requests come before the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue my every effort

04:11.920 --> 04:15.880
to see that they are not reduced to the danger of the nation.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.720
I think as we go on that some reductions may be necessary.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.400
We want to improve the programs.

04:21.400 --> 04:26.160
And above all, we want to bring all of our allies into the extent that we care to share

04:26.160 --> 04:28.000
the burden of them.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.120
The President of the United States incidentally at a large meeting this week in Washington

04:33.120 --> 04:38.320
has spoke very strongly in favor of the Mutual Security Program and I am sure that most

04:38.320 --> 04:40.080
of you have heard his message.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.080
Thank you very much.

04:41.080 --> 04:41.680
That's all for now.
