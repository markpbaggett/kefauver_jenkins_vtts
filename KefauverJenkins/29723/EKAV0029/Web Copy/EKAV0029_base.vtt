Ladies and gentlemen, our friends of Tennessee.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
During the past few weeks I have received a great many letters from constituents and people

00:23.000 --> 00:28.480
in Tennessee asking that I explain something about the drug inquiry, which the Senate Committee

00:28.480 --> 00:34.080
of Monopoly and Antitrust, of which I am chairman, is presently conducting.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.640
And I am welcome this opportunity of doing so.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.960
This committee of which I am chairman has been in existence for a number of years.

00:41.960 --> 00:47.840
We are charged with the responsibility of investigating monopoly lack of competition in order

00:47.840 --> 00:53.600
to try to see that we do not have cartels and monopolization, also to try to see that

00:53.600 --> 00:59.120
the small business man has a chance and that the consumer, in the case of drugs, the

00:59.120 --> 01:01.520
patient gets a break too.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.120
In the course of our investigation we have investigated steel, oil, automobiles, electrical

01:06.120 --> 01:08.800
equipment and many many other things.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.800
And there was a demand that there be some investigation of the manufacturer's price,

01:13.800 --> 01:16.680
the big manufacturer's price of drugs.

01:16.680 --> 01:21.360
I think we received a great deal more mail on this than we did all the other investigations

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
put together.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.640
Indeed, a number of other senators in congressmen were interested in investigation as a matter

01:27.640 --> 01:35.160
of fact, Senator Smathers filed a resolution asking it he be authorized to make an investigation,

01:35.160 --> 01:39.000
but we have been collecting material for some time.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.760
Now let me tell you just what we are trying to do.

01:43.760 --> 01:48.160
In the first place, I want to make it very, very clear that this, as in other cases,

01:48.160 --> 01:53.160
is only investigation of, at the manufacturer's level.

01:53.160 --> 01:59.840
We are not undertaking to get into the retail investigation of retail pharmacists or drug

01:59.840 --> 02:03.920
stores or wholesalers or anybody else.

02:03.920 --> 02:09.240
As a matter of fact, the retail pharmacist is entitled to make a reasonable profit.

02:09.240 --> 02:14.400
His profit is less than it is in the good many other lands of industry.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.480
Now, virtue of the fact that he has to carry such a large inventory of trade names, this

02:19.480 --> 02:21.840
does increase his cost.

02:21.840 --> 02:26.200
We have the cooperation of a great many pharmacist I'm happy to say.

02:26.200 --> 02:31.920
I'm sorry to say, however, that some seem to be letting the pharmacists take the blame

02:31.920 --> 02:39.320
for what should be, what is the blame of the large pharmaceutical manufacturers.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.520
When they get complaints about prices at the retail level, they should simply explain

02:43.520 --> 02:48.560
that they have to pay high prices to the manufacturer for these products.

02:48.560 --> 02:54.920
The second thing is that the physician is very much interested in the economic welfare

02:54.920 --> 02:55.920
of his patient.

02:55.920 --> 03:01.920
For the first time in history, the cost of drugs has exceeded the cost of medical care.

03:01.920 --> 03:06.520
Very often a physician will charge, say, $5 for a visit.

03:06.520 --> 03:11.080
The prescription may cost $9 or $9.5.

03:11.080 --> 03:15.880
The physician knows, of course, that his patient can get better treatment.

03:15.880 --> 03:20.800
He can get more of these good wonder drugs if the prices are lowered.

03:20.800 --> 03:28.120
Now let's see, and the wholesaler also in the drug field, we're not investigating him

03:28.120 --> 03:34.840
and we're not blaming him because he only, I guess, 15% differential, which is little

03:34.840 --> 03:38.120
enough for him to try to do business on.

03:38.120 --> 03:44.000
All of these are entitled to a fair profit, a fair return, and we're not fussing about

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
that.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.960
We want the big manufacturers to get a fair profit too, but we don't want them to charge

03:48.960 --> 03:51.240
excessive prices to people.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.520
Here are the high profit industries in the United States.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.880
In 1957 was a typical year.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.840
In 1958, it's about the same only.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.120
Drugs may be a little more.

04:02.120 --> 04:07.680
You will see that after taxes, after payment for all of research and everything else, the

04:07.680 --> 04:12.400
drug industry averaged almost 22% on net worth.

04:12.400 --> 04:18.400
The average for all manufacturing was just about 11%, and you see some of the others.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.040
Well let me show you something about prices.

04:22.040 --> 04:28.680
In the case of a prednisone, which is a card-zone product used for the treatment of the 11

04:28.680 --> 04:34.160
million arthritic people who must have these pills in the United States, the big companies

04:34.160 --> 04:38.320
charge the pharmacist at the same price.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.880
17 and 9 cents per pill.

04:40.880 --> 04:46.000
The little companies who meet food and drug standards and qualifications charge a whole

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
at less.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.880
They charge the government a whole at less.

04:49.880 --> 04:55.720
We are all in favor of research, but research is only about 6.5% or 7% and can account for

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
these high prices.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.360
We hope we will have more time to talk about this investigation later on.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.360
Thank you very much.
