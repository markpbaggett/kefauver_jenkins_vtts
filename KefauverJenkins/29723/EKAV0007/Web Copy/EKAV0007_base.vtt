00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I'm very happy to have on this program today

00:08.920 --> 00:16.120
with me a very good friend of mine and one of our ableist and most progressive and hard-hitting

00:16.120 --> 00:17.120
senators.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.920
A senator from Texas, Mr. Ralph, Senator Ralph Yarparin.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.480
Thank you very much, Ralph, for coming and doing with us today.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.480
Thank you, Senator.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.480
Keep all for this opportunity to be on your program.

00:29.480 --> 00:34.120
We've watched your record for years and the House of Representatives where TVA was being

00:34.120 --> 00:36.240
set up since you've been in the Senate.

00:36.240 --> 00:41.000
Your crime investigation, your investigation of monopoly, the high price of steel, the

00:41.000 --> 00:45.120
high price of drugs, all of the many services you've rendered to American people.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.520
I may not have laughed, I just want everybody to understand.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
I didn't put you up to this.

00:48.520 --> 00:53.440
I was a whole new, I know the Brown Rouge and I suppose the brag on the man who owned

00:53.440 --> 00:54.440
his program.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.360
But as this, I'm breaking the rules because I think this is important and I just want

00:58.360 --> 00:59.360
to say it.

00:59.360 --> 01:05.280
I'm a number of speeches for you in Texas in 1956 when you were running for a Vice President

01:05.280 --> 01:07.680
on the Democratic Ticket and I'm proud of everyone.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.480
Well, you're a seconder, Dad, and I appreciated you helping us too.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.840
Ralph, incidentally, a lot of your people come from Tennessee, don't they?

01:14.840 --> 01:15.840
Oh, yes.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.320
My grandfather was born in Tennessee.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.960
My paternal grandfather, Yarparin, and from the old age pension records, social scared

01:21.960 --> 01:27.240
in others, all the records we have, we know that more people have come to Texas from Tennessee

01:27.240 --> 01:28.960
than from any other state in the Union.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.960
That's right.

01:29.960 --> 01:34.580
Led there by Sam Houston, David Crockett, and many other Tennessee heroes who led the

01:34.580 --> 01:37.180
Westbridge Market, the American people, into Texas.

01:37.180 --> 01:43.320
Well, there's always been a very close relationship between the state of Texas and the state of Tennessee.

01:43.320 --> 01:49.560
But friends, I've asked Senator Yarparin here today to talk with him about, federal

01:49.560 --> 01:52.000
talk with you about federal aid for education.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.600
He was one of the chief sponsors of the bill that we passed in the United States Senate.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.760
Which is now pending in the House.

01:59.760 --> 02:04.240
I've just returned from Tennessee and I saw a lot of teachers, school people, and they

02:04.240 --> 02:06.840
all interested in this subject.

02:06.840 --> 02:11.280
I thought Senator Yarparin would be a mighty good senator who is very conversant with

02:11.280 --> 02:13.200
it to tell us about it.

02:13.200 --> 02:17.280
What tell us about the bill we got passed in the Senate's Ralph and the Need for it?

02:17.280 --> 02:22.960
Well, first of all, there's a situation today with reference to classrooms and teachers.

02:23.960 --> 02:30.080
Estus will have a shortage in the United States of about 135,000 trained school teachers

02:30.080 --> 02:33.760
and a shortage of about 140,000 classrooms.

02:33.760 --> 02:40.200
Now, that doesn't consider the million, 800,000 pupils who are in obsolete classrooms or

02:40.200 --> 02:43.960
crowded classrooms, too small, jammed up fire hazards.

02:43.960 --> 02:48.080
This is just the classrooms where they're having to have two classes today.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.680
Some students go to school half a day, some in the morning, some in the afternoon, which

02:52.680 --> 02:55.400
is a first system of education for the children.

02:55.400 --> 03:01.200
I believe the census will give us about 180 million people when it's completed.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.880
I think it's estimated that 10 years and now we'll have better than 210 million people

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
in the United States.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.880
Isn't that correct, Ralph?

03:08.880 --> 03:09.880
That's correct.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.960
In the cost of the classrooms, it's increasing.

03:11.960 --> 03:16.040
They tax burden for building these school buildings on the local homeowner and the local

03:16.040 --> 03:19.040
people has just about reached the limit.

03:19.040 --> 03:25.480
And to keep up this proper educational system, we've got to find new sources of tax revenue.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.280
Well, the future of our country depends upon the education of our youth, of course.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.160
Now, what does the bill provide in the way of our grad to the state?

03:34.160 --> 03:39.280
They build it past in the Senate, provides for a billion, nine hundred million dollars,

03:39.280 --> 03:42.160
spent over two years with an optional provision.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.160
They share for the state.

03:43.160 --> 03:47.680
Tennessee would be over twenty five million dollars a year.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.360
It is given to the state on an option.

03:49.360 --> 03:53.520
The state might spend it either for school buildings or for supplements to teach or pay

03:53.520 --> 03:55.360
or for any combination of the state.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.160
Well, we would got twenty five million a year in Tennessee.

04:00.160 --> 04:04.880
It's also based upon the needs of the state and how much would Tennessee taxpayers have

04:04.880 --> 04:05.880
to put it in.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.880
About two and three quarter million.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.560
They don't need, in my state, for example, we would get to sixty two million.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.720
Most of any state, but we have to contribute twelve million.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.560
Some twenty percent, based on need.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.160
In Tennessee, they would contribute about twelve percent.

04:19.160 --> 04:23.120
And there are no federal strings that cost us as purely a grant and as of the state's

04:23.120 --> 04:28.600
degrees, and either supplementing future salaries or for construction of schools is not

04:28.600 --> 04:29.600
correct.

04:29.600 --> 04:30.600
Absolutely.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.640
As Century Keepover, there are no federal strings on it.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.640
No federal control.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.880
Senator Lister Hill of Alabama is chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee.

04:37.880 --> 04:42.280
It's both the bill out, Senator Hill has provisions written in there all of us do to

04:42.280 --> 04:43.280
protect our state.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.280
Thank you very much, Senator Yorbren.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.280
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.

04:47.280 --> 05:05.400
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of time to see you.

05:05.400 --> 05:11.840
I have a great privilege today of introducing to you, I want you to meet a very good friend

05:11.840 --> 05:17.280
of mine in the United States Senate, an able senator from the state of Michigan, Senator

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
Pat McNamara.

05:18.280 --> 05:24.760
Pat is sure it's good to have you with us, and I'm glad to have, from our people in Tennessee,

05:24.760 --> 05:29.200
to have a chance of seeing you and of talking with you for a little while.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.800
Well, thanks, Mrs. Certainly, I'm glad you're here with you today.

05:33.800 --> 05:38.120
Senator McNamara, the first time I had the privilege of meeting him, I went up to Flint,

05:38.120 --> 05:44.160
Michigan in 1954, when he was a candidate for the United States Senate at which time he

05:44.160 --> 05:46.400
was elected.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.480
And we had a large audience, so you remember Pat of the auditorium, and I was trying to

05:51.480 --> 05:56.320
get in to make a speech, but Senator McNamara was talking about problems of the age and

05:56.320 --> 06:00.120
age it, and how long did you keep me standing out before I got a chance?

06:00.120 --> 06:04.360
Well, I tried to hurry, yes, because I was very conscious of the fact that this was your

06:04.360 --> 06:08.760
audience, but I had such fine opportunity to talk to him about something that really bothered

06:08.760 --> 06:12.200
me, but I guess we kept you waiting the best part of 45 minutes.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.440
I did at least that, but it was a lot of fun anyway.

06:15.440 --> 06:21.320
Anyway, Senator McNamara is one of our able senators, and as soon as he got to Senate,

06:21.320 --> 06:27.880
he asked for the formation of a special committee to study problems of the age and the age

06:28.880 --> 06:30.720
of the chairman of that committee.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.720
That's right.

06:31.720 --> 06:36.000
Tell us some of the findings of your committee.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.360
Well, we find that there are 16 million Americans who are in this category of the age and age

06:44.360 --> 06:51.600
and who have great problems that our society has overlooked for a number of years.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.120
One of the great problems.

06:53.120 --> 06:58.800
Well, we have many more thanks to medicine and good medication.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.240
More people are living longer now than they used to.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.240
Oh, yes.

07:02.240 --> 07:07.680
At the turn of the century, we had only about 3 million in this category, 65, and this is

07:07.680 --> 07:10.280
an indication about fastest-leaf snowballs.

07:10.280 --> 07:14.920
Well, they certainly need someone to be studying and thinking about their particular problems.

07:14.920 --> 07:21.160
How about the financial income of people in that generally, in that class?

07:21.160 --> 07:28.160
Well, our studies have indicated up to now, saying, keep over that 3 out of 5, 60 percent

07:29.640 --> 07:35.320
of these people have a money income of less than $1,000 a year.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.520
So you see, they really have an income problem.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.520
And then let's talk about some of the other problems.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
I know the full-run bill.

07:41.520 --> 07:48.520
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, a very important item of business before

07:55.040 --> 07:58.520
the Senate this week was the Mutual Security Bill.

07:58.520 --> 08:04.640
The President asked the Congress for $4,175 million in funds to continue the efforts of

08:04.640 --> 08:10.160
the United States in aiding the free friendly nations of the world to maintain their strength

08:10.160 --> 08:12.320
and growth in the face of communist Russia.

08:12.320 --> 08:17.320
And I may say in this connection, the President feels that this is the most important bill

08:17.320 --> 08:22.480
before the Congress for the security of the United States and of the free world.

08:22.480 --> 08:28.960
Well, the Senate passed a bill which calls for $4,125 million, a reduction of $20,000

08:28.960 --> 08:31.080
under the President's request.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.840
Among many amendments offered were two, which I voted for.

08:34.840 --> 08:39.840
The first of these calls on the Arab Republic to observe freedom of the seas and the administration

08:39.840 --> 08:41.800
of Suez Canal.

08:41.800 --> 08:46.400
All nations are affected by this amendment, although the primary need for the provision

08:46.400 --> 08:51.760
was the recent denial of passage to ships of the Israeli Republic.

08:51.760 --> 08:56.600
I do not believe use of this international waterway should be denied to any nation and

08:56.600 --> 09:01.880
was led to take my stand with many of my colleagues in the Senate in favor of this amendment.

09:01.880 --> 09:08.120
And this is a position incidentally that's been taken by the United Nations General Assembly.

09:08.120 --> 09:12.080
After amendment, for which I voted was defeated, I'm sorry to say.

09:12.080 --> 09:18.360
It calls for a reduction of some $200 million in the military aid funds to foreign nations.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.520
It has been my view for a number of years at the success of the free nations and their

09:22.520 --> 09:25.240
striving for strength and peace.

09:25.240 --> 09:31.560
Can best be served in most instances by economic aid, rather than pure military aid.

09:31.560 --> 09:36.280
I felt for some time that building up the economic sounds and growth of these nations with

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
technical assistance.

09:37.280 --> 09:44.240
In other ways, we are trying to help make them better bashedms against communism than

09:44.240 --> 09:47.360
just by sending them tanks and guns.

09:47.360 --> 09:52.600
It is for this reason that I have sponsored a resolution in Congress calling for a review

09:52.600 --> 10:00.560
of the NATO nation's many programs of economic aid to underdevelop and uncommitted nations.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.480
Coordination of our efforts along these lines will do much.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.600
I believe to reduce duplication and to eliminate waste.

10:07.600 --> 10:13.640
It will also go a long way toward more sharing of the expense burden by channeling aid from

10:13.640 --> 10:20.040
other allies into the areas where we must win friends and keep them in the coal war.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.160
And unfortunately, continues relentless.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.920
In summation, I would like to make this observation about the mutual security program and what

10:27.920 --> 10:28.920
it stands for.

10:29.640 --> 10:33.040
There are some who will say that it is purely a far and give-away.

10:33.040 --> 10:38.760
There are others who will in the name of waste seek to put an end to this vital program.

10:38.760 --> 10:44.680
I think the most charitable thing that can be placed on such views is to say that they

10:44.680 --> 10:46.920
are not fully enlightened.

10:46.920 --> 10:51.560
I believe that such views must spring from either blandness to the facts of life and the

10:51.560 --> 10:56.080
world today or from a failure to face these facts.

10:56.080 --> 11:00.480
I agree that there have been many instances of waste and many of our programs.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.720
And we must eliminate these wherever we can.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.440
But we do not cut off our hand to cure uninfected fingers.

11:07.440 --> 11:11.640
And we cannot afford to forget that missiles and science have turned thousands of miles

11:11.640 --> 11:15.200
into minutes in 1960.

11:15.200 --> 11:20.440
And have made next-door neighbors out of people's tens of thousands of miles away.

11:20.440 --> 11:25.240
Our global neighbors include friends and forwards and many thousands of people who have made no

11:25.240 --> 11:27.520
commitments to either side.

11:27.520 --> 11:32.520
Our own security in our very living rooms here at home depends upon finding the answers

11:32.520 --> 11:37.600
to the security of our friends who stand with us against Russia.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.080
Mutual security is not an idle phrase.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
It is not a far and give-away.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.480
It is I assure you life and death to all of us.

11:45.480 --> 11:49.720
And we must continue to support it and to fight for it against those who would cut it

11:49.720 --> 11:51.440
to ribbons.

11:51.440 --> 11:56.520
In these requests come before the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue my every effort

11:56.520 --> 12:00.440
to see that they are not reduced to the danger of the nation.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.280
I think as we go on, that some reductions may be necessary.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.760
We want to improve the programs.

12:05.760 --> 12:10.720
And above all, we want to bring all of our allies into the extent that we care to share

12:10.720 --> 12:11.720
the burden of them.

12:11.720 --> 12:16.960
The President of the United States says that we are the large meeting this week in Washington.

12:16.960 --> 12:22.840
I spoke very strongly in favor of the Mutual Security Program and I am sure that most

12:22.840 --> 12:24.320
of you heard his message.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.320
Thank you very much.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.240
That's all for now.
