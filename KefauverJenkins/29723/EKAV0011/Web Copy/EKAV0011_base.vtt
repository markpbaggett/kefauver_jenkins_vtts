00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee,

00:10.000 --> 00:16.160
after many days of stormy hearings, voted last week by a narrow margin of one vote to confirm

00:16.160 --> 00:20.000
Louis L. Strauss, a Secretary of Commerce.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.760
I expect the final vote on him to come up on the Senate floor this week and to be rather

00:24.760 --> 00:25.760
close.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.640
I have opposed Admiral Strauss because I feel that his part in the infamous Dixon Yates

00:30.640 --> 00:37.080
power case throws a serious cloud over his suitability for the post he seeks, or for any other

00:37.080 --> 00:41.760
post in our government where he will be responsible for the people's business.

00:41.760 --> 00:47.680
Admiral Strauss still evades the questions asked by me and other senators in that hearing.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.400
The Justice Department still refuses to investigate.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.160
While his part in the sculled agree of the Dixon Yates message cleared up, I say he

00:56.160 --> 01:01.120
is not fit to hold the position of Secretary of Commerce in our government.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.920
A conflict of interest calls the cancellation of that power contract, and the government

01:05.920 --> 01:10.360
is defending his suit on these very same grounds.

01:10.360 --> 01:15.600
Admiral Strauss has achieved promoter and defender of the Dixon Yates contract, claimed he knew

01:15.600 --> 01:21.360
nothing of this conflict of interest, and yet he was working with the man who was involved

01:21.360 --> 01:26.960
in it, and knew all about the contract from the beginning to end.

01:26.960 --> 01:31.240
Yet he was working right where they represent it of private industry, who was also working

01:31.240 --> 01:37.520
with the, and as an employee of the Bureau of the Budget during the time this contract

01:37.520 --> 01:39.240
was being negotiated.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.080
If Admiral Strauss knew nothing about this, he has no business handling the public's business.

01:45.080 --> 01:50.360
If he did not, then he is not qualified to hold any such responsible post.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.360
I will not vote for him as long as these questions about him are not answered.

01:56.360 --> 02:02.000
And now to other matters, as a member of the Interior Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee,

02:02.000 --> 02:07.760
I had the privilege this week of urging on behalf of Senator Gore and myself an additional

02:07.760 --> 02:14.360
$240,000 to provide 200 more campsites in the Smoky Mountain National Park.

02:14.360 --> 02:19.960
I also did this on behalf of the Smoky Mountain National Park Commission and Herbides

02:19.960 --> 02:23.000
Walters of Maristown, its chairman.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.800
Conrad Worth, the Director of the National Park Service, backed this request wholeheartedly.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.480
More than 3 million people visited our park last year.

02:32.480 --> 02:36.920
This is more than twice as many as visited any of our other national parks.

02:36.920 --> 02:41.760
And yet it should be pointed out that some of the other national parks receiving appropriations

02:41.760 --> 02:44.920
two or three times more than the Smoky Mountain National Park.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.320
I don't fuss about this because I know they need the funds.

02:48.720 --> 02:54.080
But I do think our park has been somewhat neglected by way of facilities.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.880
And I'm anxious to see that this is remedied.

02:56.880 --> 03:04.520
Already this year, campground use and the Smoky Mountain National Park is up 12% over last year.

03:04.520 --> 03:09.280
If the additional appropriation is granted and I feel confident it will be,

03:09.280 --> 03:14.560
it will mean that 160,000 more persons will find a place to pitch their tent

03:14.560 --> 03:19.480
in the Smoky Mountain National Park and can be taken care of at present.

03:19.480 --> 03:25.960
Our park is primarily a hikers and campers park, more so than any other in the nation.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.920
And campers are knocking at the gates right now.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.200
And there's not enough campsites to accommodate them.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.960
These new sites are seriously needed to ease the situation.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.400
And I think I should point out that the interior department for the national parks

03:40.400 --> 03:43.120
is getting less than it did last year.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.760
The house has cut the amount that it would get.

03:45.760 --> 03:51.920
So that this doesn't run over the pest and it's budget and is not a excessive amount.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.800
And I feel it is very highly justified.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.200
And another thing, just as I'm making this broadcast,

03:57.200 --> 04:04.360
is that it is considering a new price support formula for the tobacco growers of our nation.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.640
And all of the tobacco people and producers in Tennessee are very much interested

04:08.640 --> 04:12.400
in keeping the program about like it is at the present time.

04:12.400 --> 04:17.400
Of course, Mr. Benson would like to have flexible price support so he could reduce him down

04:17.400 --> 04:19.480
to nothing if necessary.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.800
But the tobacco is one industry where we've had a successful operation

04:23.800 --> 04:27.760
where there have not been big surfaces where it's pitted its own way.

04:27.760 --> 04:33.240
And this compares a very favorably with the difficulty we have had in other agricultural

04:33.240 --> 04:34.440
products.

04:34.440 --> 04:39.000
So I expect to support this legislation and keep the tobacco program

04:39.000 --> 04:41.080
as near like it is now as possible.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.000
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.560
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee,

04:57.560 --> 05:04.360
the Atlantic Congress, which will begin its sessions in London on June 5 in just a few days,

05:04.360 --> 05:09.320
will I believe be one of the most important meetings looking toward Atlantic unity

05:09.320 --> 05:14.920
and toward peace in the world and toward having a common front among freedom-loving people

05:14.920 --> 05:19.640
and holding our own against communism that will has ever been held.

05:19.640 --> 05:25.400
This Congress is modeled after the Hague Conference of 1948,

05:25.400 --> 05:30.200
from which resulted the Council of Europe, the common market in Europe,

05:30.200 --> 05:33.720
the steel in iron community and many other things.

05:33.800 --> 05:40.600
We have a privilege, incidentally delegates from all of the 15 NATO countries will be there.

05:40.600 --> 05:46.760
They've been busily making arrangements, writing papers, talking about a agenda,

05:46.760 --> 05:53.560
making plans to make this a very, very useful Congress for five or six days.

05:53.560 --> 05:58.760
The Executive Director of the United States Committee for the Atlantic Congress

05:58.760 --> 06:03.160
was my former administrative assistant, Richard J. Wallace.

06:03.160 --> 06:07.800
He took a leave of absence in order to be the Executive Director of this Committee,

06:07.800 --> 06:12.840
and he's worked very successfully at it, and I think a great deal of the success

06:13.720 --> 06:20.200
of the Congress and certainly of our American group will be due to the leadership in the effort of Dick Wallace.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.240
Dick, I'm glad to have you here to talk with our friends in Tennessee.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.600
Well, thank you, Santa.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.000
Santa is certainly good to be here, let you.

06:29.080 --> 06:34.920
Tell us some of the details and fill us in on what we're going to do in this Atlantic.

06:34.920 --> 06:41.080
Well, Santa, you know you started, at least, two years ago at the NATO Parliament Terrence Congress.

06:41.080 --> 06:45.640
And I'm not a stupid prohibitive me from saying too much about that.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.000
Some people have called it a sort of summit conference of citizens.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.840
And in a rate of resolution was passed by the NATO Parliament Terrence Congress came out of

06:54.840 --> 06:58.840
your committee, it was your proposal that there be an Atlantic Congress issue,

06:58.840 --> 07:02.360
bringing together representatives of all the 15 NATO nations.

07:03.480 --> 07:08.920
To discuss not only what has happened in NATO in its first 10 years of existence,

07:08.920 --> 07:13.880
but what ought to happen in the Atlantic community for the future, what the future looks like.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.200
As you mentioned, there have been organizations underway.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.160
Now we're the one in the United States, the United States Committee,

07:21.160 --> 07:25.640
but there's some organizations in every other NATO nation.

07:26.280 --> 07:31.640
They've all been making studies, plans for the Congress, and selecting delegates,

07:31.640 --> 07:36.600
the real outstanding leaders of the whole Western world will be President and the Congress.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.960
And I believe the Queen's going to open the Congress.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.680
The Queen opens the Congress on June 5th in Westminster Hall.

07:45.640 --> 07:54.440
And the closing session is on June 9th at which time there'll be such people as a Prime Minister,

07:54.440 --> 08:00.440
Mr. Spark, Mr. Harvard, Lange, Belgium, various heads of government as well as citizens,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.520
which shows importance of the government's attached to this, all the way to this,

08:05.160 --> 08:06.680
a non-official gathering.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.600
I think we have you have three pages of papers that have been prepared,

08:10.680 --> 08:14.040
and ideas that will be developed at this Atlantic Congress.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.840
Perhaps you'd summarize some of them.

08:16.840 --> 08:21.640
One I've been interested in at the American Bar Association has been interested in trying to have

08:22.440 --> 08:24.280
established the idea of peace by law.

08:25.240 --> 08:30.760
And Charlie Ryan, the former President, is a delegate and he is proposing a NATO court of justice

08:30.760 --> 08:33.720
to settle arguments between the NATO countries. Is that one?

08:33.720 --> 08:34.920
That's one.

08:35.400 --> 08:41.800
On the ranch, proposal also a citizen of the NATO countries could bring a case.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.720
For instance, he points out that the fisheries case could very well been settled by us.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.280
Excellent.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.520
That's the Iceland-Munbrettens fisheries dispute.

08:51.320 --> 08:57.480
Other proposals are the Atlantic Institute, which would set up a continuing study by for the whole

08:57.480 --> 09:04.040
Atlantic Community and Economic Council that could poo some of the work of the NATO nations

09:04.040 --> 09:09.320
in undeveloped areas and cost less for each one of the nations together and probably do a

09:09.320 --> 09:12.840
better overall job. But all these things will be discussed at the Congress.

09:12.840 --> 09:18.600
And then we want to have a work out methods of better consultation and having a higher status

09:18.600 --> 09:22.120
for the members of the NATO Council and many other things. And if we can bring about

09:23.320 --> 09:25.800
a real working arrangements between these nations,

09:25.800 --> 09:29.720
a crew chef in the communists might be less apt to throw us into wars.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.840
And today certainly might.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.840
Well, I hope to be there and thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

09:43.880 --> 09:48.200
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this is Charlie Calderall, Senator Keith Orders,

09:48.200 --> 09:51.960
administrative assistant. I've been trying to hold the fort while the senator was in London at

09:51.960 --> 09:56.440
the Atlantic Congress and we're glad to have him back. Well, thank you, Charlie. I certainly

09:56.520 --> 10:02.760
am glad to get back and I wanted to report it very briefly, but you asked me questions as well.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.320
I'd like to align out what you thought the net result of the Congress was.

10:07.320 --> 10:11.480
Well, first let me tell a little something about the Congress. And I think it's really one of the great

10:11.480 --> 10:19.000
historic, uh, congresses or meetings that I have ever attended. This is of course the 10th

10:19.000 --> 10:25.640
anniversary of our North Atlantic treaty organization, which is an agreement between 15 nations of

10:25.960 --> 10:32.200
North Atlantic to stand together militarily. Then Article 2 of the treaty provides that we try to

10:32.200 --> 10:38.040
work together economically and politically also. Well, Charlie, during the 10 years, uh,

10:38.040 --> 10:43.560
NATO has worked very well militarily, although we have had some difficulties as we're having a

10:43.560 --> 10:49.400
difficulty with France right now with reference to location of a atomic basis.

10:50.040 --> 10:55.480
But anyway, the North Atlantic treaty organization has saved the freedom of Europe and has stopped

10:55.640 --> 11:01.720
the communists from any military aggression. But during this time, it's been increasingly clear

11:01.720 --> 11:08.200
that conditions in the world are changing with the coming end of cruise chef and is a cold economic

11:08.200 --> 11:14.200
war. His attempt to win to him, the uncommitted people of the world, to try to divide the NATO nations.

11:14.920 --> 11:19.480
It's been quite apparent that we had to help more than just a military alliance.

11:20.120 --> 11:26.760
Was the, uh, uh, the congresses, I understand it was represented by all the countries, by

11:26.760 --> 11:35.080
citizens, citizens of the countries who, uh, were there at their own expense. The meeting was

11:35.080 --> 11:41.000
opened by Queen Elizabeth in the Westminster Hall, where she made a very fine speech and then

11:42.280 --> 11:49.000
Prime Minister Harold McMillan of England responded. Then after that, it was divided into five

11:49.000 --> 11:54.840
committees, where people earnestly diagnosed what needed to be done in the North Atlantic community

11:54.840 --> 12:00.120
in order to have more strength. We've had military people meeting, we've had parliamentarians

12:00.120 --> 12:06.840
meeting, but this was the first time that the average citizen was given a chance. There was the

12:06.840 --> 12:12.680
spiritual and cultural committee, the political committee and military committee committee

12:12.680 --> 12:18.040
dealing with, uh, how NATO should deal with the communist bloc and then how NATO should deal with

12:18.040 --> 12:25.240
the uncommitted world. We, uh, had their chowly all of the NATO ambassadors. We had Mr. Spock,

12:25.240 --> 12:33.240
we had General Narsdad, we had Admiral Wright and the leaders from all of the European nations

12:33.240 --> 12:38.280
were tremendously interested. I've never seen people work so hard in my life. Well, here are some

12:38.280 --> 12:44.920
of the accomplishments the declaration was made by, uh, committee by Eric Johnson, the President

12:45.080 --> 12:52.360
of our group and by Paul Van Sealen, the former Prime Minister of Belgium. We, uh, there was

12:52.360 --> 12:58.920
the term in that, uh, NATO in the first place militarily that the nation should come up to their

12:58.920 --> 13:06.360
commitments and that we should have an overall NATO command. It was decided to institute with private

13:06.360 --> 13:12.760
contributions, a North Atlantic institute to inform the people about the community of interests.

13:13.560 --> 13:19.320
We have a, uh, who has decided to make the NATO Apollimentarians Association an official

13:19.320 --> 13:24.680
organ of NATO so that we can have some political discussion. We decided to call on the member

13:24.680 --> 13:32.840
governments to set up a small conference or commission of a citizens to study at greater

13:32.840 --> 13:38.440
length ways and means where the common unity and cooperation should be increased and report

13:38.520 --> 13:44.120
back to their governments. We passed a resolution applauding the position of the West in connection

13:44.120 --> 13:52.600
with protecting the freedom of the people of West Berlin. It was, uh, decided that there should be

13:52.600 --> 13:58.520
closer adherents to the report of the three wise men in consultation about all, uh, political

13:58.520 --> 14:04.520
matters and that we ought to jointly work upon our efforts to furnish, uh, assistance and technical

14:04.520 --> 14:10.520
guidance and, uh, leadership to the people in the uncommitted nation. So that's the so

14:10.520 --> 14:14.520
wide range of leaders. I'm not sure, but I think the clock has caught up with us. Uh, we'll be back

14:14.520 --> 14:17.320
next week with senators report. Thank you very much.

14:27.720 --> 14:34.440
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, let me pause today and lay aside the issues

14:34.440 --> 14:40.920
and the problems of the Senate for a moment. This is a season when hundreds of our young people

14:40.920 --> 14:48.360
in Tennessee and all over the nation are leaving behind them the golden days of high school or of

14:48.360 --> 14:57.000
college. This is the time when the dreams of youth must be translated at last into the accomplishments

14:57.000 --> 15:05.800
of life. This is the time when a parent sees in the shining face of his child that this young one

15:05.800 --> 15:14.760
is no longer really a child, but a man or a woman now facing the challenge of a vigorous and competitive

15:14.760 --> 15:22.120
world. Out of the dreams of young men and women come their raw materials for building a life

15:22.840 --> 15:30.920
with meaning and with substance. This is your challenge. It is a challenge of many faces.

15:32.120 --> 15:38.840
You will see it in the hand of a small child someday when it reaches to you for strength and guidance.

15:40.200 --> 15:46.920
You will see it in the hard holes of commerce. Hear it in the courts of law and find it across

15:46.920 --> 15:55.320
the bargaining table. You will see it in your church and your civic club and perhaps even reach it

15:55.320 --> 16:01.400
in the empty void of space on the way to the moon before your life time has run its course.

16:02.760 --> 16:10.200
Theodore Roosevelt once remarked that life was a great adventure and that the worst of all fears

16:10.200 --> 16:18.200
was the fear of living. Well, I have seen no fear in the faces or words of the young graduates I

16:18.200 --> 16:25.640
have addressed in the past month in Tennessee. And as a matter of fact, I also had the privilege of

16:25.640 --> 16:32.680
delivering the graduating address when my daughter Linda graduated here in high school in Washington.

16:33.640 --> 16:40.760
And I just thought as I saw all of these wonderful children graduating in high schools in Tennessee,

16:41.800 --> 16:47.800
what a great thing it would be if we could see to it that they all had opportunities in business and

16:47.800 --> 16:56.680
farming and industry in the volunteer state and not have to send them out of the some other state

16:56.680 --> 17:03.320
to have an opportunity. This is incidentally as a great challenge to us grown-ups to do everything

17:03.320 --> 17:08.840
we can to see that this is possible. Rather than the faces and the words of these young people,

17:08.840 --> 17:16.280
I have seen only confidence and a determination to conquer the economic, social, and political and

17:16.280 --> 17:23.560
cultural challenges of a most difficult era. If there is anything I can tell you that may help

17:23.560 --> 17:31.320
your natural armor reflect the warmth and the light of the sun, it might be this. Make your first

17:31.320 --> 17:40.120
mistakes your stepping stones to success, not pitfalls of disaster. You won't be alone whichever way

17:40.120 --> 17:47.480
you walk. Make your government at the local, state, and national level your direct concern.

17:48.440 --> 17:56.600
The only time politics becomes a nasty word is when citizens turn their backs on it. Work for

17:56.600 --> 18:04.840
good government and then you will get good government. Make your own decisions. Advice such as mine

18:04.840 --> 18:12.680
may be of value, but you are the one who will live with your life. Design it for happiness and

18:12.680 --> 18:21.160
around the contribution you can make to society and to your fellow men. Make no place for cynics or

18:21.160 --> 18:27.320
profits of doom. They will tell you that the splitting of the atom has made your world a mockery,

18:27.880 --> 18:35.000
that your efforts for peace and mankind are in vain. Health faith in yourself, in your people,

18:35.000 --> 18:42.360
and in your country. This is your time in history. You can make it or break it. And with it all,

18:42.360 --> 18:48.680
may God bless you as you meet the hours and the days and the years of your life which laugh

18:48.680 --> 18:56.520
hit. I know you will ask for his guidance. Use it to direct your steps as you meet the thrilling

18:56.520 --> 19:00.600
challenges that are yours and yours alone. Thank you.

19:05.080 --> 19:17.160
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, as I make this broadcast year for Washington,

19:17.160 --> 19:22.040
the United States Senate is still debating the appointment of Lewis L. Strauss to the

19:22.040 --> 19:28.040
Post of Secretary of Commerce. Earlier this week, I delivered a lengthy address on this issue

19:28.040 --> 19:34.280
on the floor of the Senate. My task was not a happy one. I was compelled to put aside my natural

19:34.280 --> 19:39.160
inclination to support the President of the United States and the executive nomination.

19:39.960 --> 19:45.240
My sincerity in saying this is borne out by the fact that in the last six and a half years of

19:45.240 --> 19:50.040
this administration, many thousands, hundreds of thousands of executive nominations,

19:50.760 --> 19:55.720
which have come before the Senate, I have supported all but a very few, three I believe.

19:56.360 --> 20:00.200
And I believe that history has supported the stand I took in those instances.

20:01.160 --> 20:05.880
Those who have been pushing the confirmation of Mr. Strauss have sought to divert attention from

20:05.880 --> 20:13.640
the real issue. The issue is not simply public power versus private power. It is not presidential prestige.

20:14.280 --> 20:18.600
It is not the patriotism of one man as compared to the patriotism of other men.

20:19.160 --> 20:23.800
Nor is it by any, by the wildest stretch of the imagination and issue of religion.

20:24.520 --> 20:30.520
The true issue is, in my opinion, that Louis L Strauss is unfit to hold the important

20:30.520 --> 20:36.520
post of Secretary of Commerce, because he has consistently and cynically sought to deceive

20:36.520 --> 20:42.840
the American people. I experienced this trait in Mr. Strauss at first hand during the lengthy

20:42.840 --> 20:50.360
hearings on the notorious Dixonates contract. The facts developed in the antitrust subcommittee hearings

20:50.360 --> 20:56.200
revealed a disgraceful attempt by the big finance and power interest to destroy the Tennessee

20:56.200 --> 21:03.400
Valley Authority. These facts pointed a finger directly at Louis L Strauss. He could not have failed

21:03.400 --> 21:09.000
to know of the conflict of interest, which finally led to the cancellation of the Dixonates contract.

21:09.960 --> 21:14.200
When Mr. Strauss came before the interstate and foreign commerce committee recently,

21:14.760 --> 21:21.240
these facts were brought out again, and again Mr. Strauss sought to twist out from under them.

21:21.800 --> 21:27.480
He implied half-truths and misstatements. The senators on this committee who voted unfavorably

21:27.480 --> 21:33.560
on reporting his confirmation cited seven specific instances in which Louis L Strauss

21:34.200 --> 21:39.400
sought to deceive the committee in the course of the very hearings on his fitness to hold the

21:39.400 --> 21:45.960
post of Secretary of Commerce. These are the seven findings of the senators. One, he flatly

21:45.960 --> 21:51.960
misrepresented to the committee his responsibility for rejecting an application for a license to

21:51.960 --> 21:58.280
export steel pipe. Second, he falsely denied making its statement for a subcommittee of the House

21:58.280 --> 22:04.200
appropriations committee. Three, he distorted the nature of a charge brought against him by Senator

22:04.360 --> 22:11.240
Anderson concerning the export of ISIL tones. Fourth, in dealing with charges that he had failed to

22:11.240 --> 22:17.480
keep the joint committee on atomic energy properly informed, Louis Strauss sought to distort the record.

22:18.360 --> 22:24.920
And fifth, Louis L Strauss denied knowledge of the conflict of interest in the Dixonates contract

22:24.920 --> 22:31.000
and attempted to hide it. And I will have more to say about this later if I have time.

22:31.800 --> 22:37.960
And six, he falsely sought to create the impression that he had no connection with the ill-advised

22:37.960 --> 22:44.600
actions of the AEC. Seven, he denied that he had ever sought material against a hostile witness

22:45.240 --> 22:50.280
and was later confronted with an official letter showing that he had sought and received this

22:50.280 --> 22:57.480
material. Well, against this most recent backdrop of deception, the long record of hearings and

22:57.480 --> 23:05.400
innovations in the Dixonates Yates case stand out in starking clarity today. The chain of events

23:05.400 --> 23:11.480
shows beyond the shadow of a doubt that Louis L Strauss must have known of the conflict of interest

23:12.040 --> 23:17.640
that infected the entire Dixonates deal from its very beginning, which the Department of Justice

23:17.640 --> 23:23.640
of Justice now conceives. Everyone around him and their atomic energy commission and the Bureau

23:23.720 --> 23:30.040
of the Budget knew of it. It could not escape to him. When I placed this chain of facts alongside

23:30.040 --> 23:36.200
the half facts and misstatements charged to Louis L Strauss by the Senators of the Interstate and

23:36.200 --> 23:42.520
Foreign Commerce Committee who opposed his nomination, I could come to only one honest conclusion.

23:43.160 --> 23:49.640
My conclusion was that Louis L Strauss has continually sought to deceive the American people.

23:49.720 --> 23:54.680
In the face of this overwhelming proof, I simply cannot vote for his confirmation. Thank you

23:54.680 --> 23:56.680
and that's all for this time.

24:08.680 --> 24:14.680
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, President Eisenhower at his press conference last week

24:14.680 --> 24:18.600
in talking about the labor management dispute in the steel industry,

24:18.600 --> 24:23.240
said that he wished he had a fact sheet about the labor management battle that is now going on.

24:24.120 --> 24:28.760
The Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee of which I am chairman has obtained many facts about

24:28.760 --> 24:34.840
this vital industry over more than two years of difficult hearings. I have gathered together

24:34.840 --> 24:40.120
those particular facts which I think are most relevant to the issues raised by the present

24:40.120 --> 24:44.760
labor management dispute in the steel industry. And I agree with the President that it would be

24:44.760 --> 24:50.600
well to make as much information about this public as possible. And I'm glad to send such

24:50.600 --> 24:55.880
information as I have to the President. And I would like to report the primary facts that we

24:55.880 --> 25:02.120
have been able to obtain to you here today on the subject of wages and productivity in the steel

25:02.120 --> 25:09.480
industry. Wages in terms of average hourly earnings are somewhat higher in the steel industry than

25:09.640 --> 25:16.520
in any other American manufacturing industry with the exception of flat glass. Despite a short

25:16.520 --> 25:24.520
decline in steel operating rate from 85 percent in 1957 to only 61 percent in 1958,

25:25.320 --> 25:32.280
man-hour productivity measured on the basis of hours paid showed only a 3.2 percent decline.

25:32.920 --> 25:38.680
While based on hours worked it remained virtually unchanged. It would thus appear that

25:38.680 --> 25:44.680
improvements in efficiency were of sufficient magnitude to offset the decrease in productivity

25:45.240 --> 25:51.640
resulting from the lower levels of output. Now on the subject of cost and prices in the steel

25:51.640 --> 26:00.200
industry, the increase in steel prices in 1957 was about twice the amount of the increase in cost

26:00.760 --> 26:06.440
resulting from the wage adjustments call for in the contract between the steel companies and the

26:06.440 --> 26:12.200
United Steel Workers. Profits for the industry have generally been sufficient to enable the major

26:12.200 --> 26:18.600
steel companies to finance most of their expansion since World War II out of retained earnings.

26:19.240 --> 26:24.120
They have made little use of the vast amount of savings in the hands of the investing public

26:24.680 --> 26:31.000
as a source of funds to finance finance plant expansion and improvement. It is a consumer

26:31.000 --> 26:36.520
through the prices which he pays that has financed most of the industry's capital improvements.

26:37.320 --> 26:43.640
What are some of the results? Instead of being just a part of the general inflationary movement,

26:44.120 --> 26:49.720
the price advance in steel since World War II has been substantially greater than that of the

26:49.720 --> 26:56.520
rest of the economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the finished steel price increase

26:56.600 --> 27:05.080
was greater than any of the BLS wholesale commodity groups from 47 to 58, from 53 to 58,

27:05.080 --> 27:11.480
and from 56 to 58. The increase in the price of finished steel was approximately four times

27:11.480 --> 27:19.640
greater than the increase in the all commodity index from 1947 to 58. What is all this

27:19.640 --> 27:25.640
costing the people of the United States? The cost of direct bars of steel of the price

27:26.120 --> 27:32.600
between the second half of 55 and 1958 has been more than five billion dollars.

27:33.320 --> 27:38.680
This is without allowing for the pure-mitting which takes place between the direct buyer and the

27:38.680 --> 27:45.400
ultimate consumer. As we all know, when steel gets to the consumer in the form of everything from

27:45.400 --> 27:50.920
bobby pins to automobiles, the price increases have been multiplied several times.

27:51.880 --> 27:57.960
Ladies and gentlemen, I have reported to you only a few of the cold-hard facts about the price of steel.

27:58.680 --> 28:03.640
By the time you hear these words, the contract between the steel workers and the steel industry

28:03.640 --> 28:09.800
will have passed. Whether a strike is in progress at this moment or not, the facts behind this

28:09.800 --> 28:16.520
dispute are still significant and important. If making them available to the public serves to help,

28:17.160 --> 28:22.040
the steel industry solve these problems, then I am glad to have been able to present them.

28:22.040 --> 28:26.680
And let me say that I think that there is enough in this picture so that some concessions

28:26.680 --> 28:32.440
can be made both on the side of management and of the steel workers to enable them to get

28:32.440 --> 28:39.080
together on a contract which would avoid a strike and a fuller spiral in the inflationary

28:39.080 --> 28:42.680
period that we have been going through. I certainly hope that that will be the case.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.000
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.360
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

29:01.080 --> 29:05.560
Last year, as you will remember, the Senate passed a good and workable self-financing bill

29:05.560 --> 29:11.000
for the Tennessee Valley Authority. We haven't had any appropriations for any new starts and

29:11.000 --> 29:17.400
major construction in the TVA since the Eisenhower administration came to office in 1953.

29:18.120 --> 29:23.800
The president himself recommended that in lieu of appropriations, we be given the right to finance

29:23.800 --> 29:29.880
ourselves in Safari's power operations and construction are concerned. The House began renewed

29:29.880 --> 29:35.560
consideration of the bill week before last. The private power lobby was out in force and conducted

29:35.560 --> 29:41.240
a vigorous campaign against it. Then this week, the House Rules Committee met and voted to deny

29:41.240 --> 29:46.360
the TVA a rule for consideration of the bill. This means that unless the Rules Committee

29:46.360 --> 29:51.960
reconsideres and I earnestly hope it will, it would take a two-thirds vote to even bring the bill

29:51.960 --> 29:57.560
up on the floor for debate. I'm heart sick over this action in the House, but I'm not giving

29:57.560 --> 30:02.760
willing to give up until the last whistle is blown on this Congress. Right now, we don't have a

30:02.760 --> 30:08.520
two-thirds vote in favor of anything for the TVA and the House. We only had two votes in our

30:08.520 --> 30:13.480
favor on the Rules Committee, but I think the Rules Committee may have completely not have

30:13.480 --> 30:18.920
completely understood the issue and therefore may reconsider. The tactics of the private

30:18.920 --> 30:24.840
power lobby, however, should now be clear for anyone to see. For years, they complained about the

30:24.840 --> 30:29.640
TVA getting appropriations, but it's clear now that they really weren't worried about those

30:29.640 --> 30:36.040
appropriations, which the TVA has always repaid on schedule with a handsome return to the government.

30:36.600 --> 30:41.400
For now, they are clearly on the record as wanting to denounce even the right to finance ourselves.

30:42.120 --> 30:46.360
They are recklessly willing to jeopardize the investment that the government already has

30:46.920 --> 30:52.520
in the TVA and the future of an entire region just to satisfy their own selfish weight.

30:53.160 --> 30:59.480
They simply want to kill the TVA as is simple as that. And then with the example of TVA gone,

30:59.960 --> 31:05.880
they want to run away with their own prices. They want again the unfettered chance to gouge the

31:05.880 --> 31:11.880
consumer. The greed of the private power lobby has brought it to grief before. And I predict that

31:11.880 --> 31:18.120
with this example reminiscent as it is of the old ensue days, the private power lobby is headed

31:18.120 --> 31:23.560
for grief again. It just doesn't know the meaning of the philosophy of live and let live.

31:24.440 --> 31:30.680
The House Rules Committee dealt a serious and perhaps mortal blow to two other good and worthwhile

31:30.680 --> 31:36.760
pieces of legislation this week. One of these was the Farm Bill. And I hope that they will reconsider

31:36.760 --> 31:43.080
that also. The House tried desperately to overrule its rules committee on the bill. And while there

31:43.080 --> 31:48.440
was a clear majority vote in favor of such action, the bill failed to get the necessary two thirds vote.

31:49.080 --> 31:54.600
As you know, I supported and worked for this Farm Bill in the Senate and it passed in the Senate.

31:54.600 --> 32:00.840
The House Agricultural Committee reported it out in substantially the same form by unanimous vote.

32:00.840 --> 32:06.360
The Rules Committee decided to use its veto. This is serious in that it means unless the bill is

32:06.360 --> 32:12.520
pried out of the House, there will be a cut in cotton acreage. It also means that the small farmer will

32:12.520 --> 32:19.320
get a further cut and some of them can't hardly survive as it is. And it delays the day when cotton

32:19.320 --> 32:24.760
will become competitive on the world market. Finally, there's the community facilities bill that

32:24.760 --> 32:30.360
I sponsored along with Senator Fulbright in the Senate. It passed the Senate. This bill would have

32:30.360 --> 32:36.520
made it possible for communities, utility districts, cities and school boards to finance local public

32:36.520 --> 32:42.200
works programs at low interest rates and over a long period of years. It would have been a great

32:42.200 --> 32:48.040
help to the economy and to giving people jobs. I can't remember anything which has creative

32:48.040 --> 32:53.320
so much interest among the local officials of Tennessee. I have letters from many, many mayors,

32:53.320 --> 32:57.960
county judges and others outlining much needed work that they would do under this program.

32:58.600 --> 33:04.600
But again, the House Rules Committee denied it a rule. All I can say is that we will try again next year.

33:05.400 --> 33:10.840
There are often disappointments in this business of legislation. You work awfully hard for

33:10.840 --> 33:16.520
something and then see it lost. But the only thing to do is to keep trying. I often think of the

33:16.520 --> 33:23.080
late Senator George Norris. He tried for years to establish the TBA only to fail repeatedly.

33:23.080 --> 33:27.960
Then finally, he had the satisfaction of seeing his dream become the greatest example of democracy

33:27.960 --> 33:36.680
and action in the world. We must never give up. Thank you and goodbye until next week.
