00:30.000 --> 00:34.560
and will power to do something for themselves and their family.

00:34.560 --> 00:39.720
I am Boyden McCall, General Former of the Follensbeast Hill Corporation.

00:39.720 --> 00:43.820
I have lived in this city for just childhood.

00:43.820 --> 00:47.600
I have watched the boys grow up and go into the mill.

00:47.600 --> 00:52.200
I have seen others die and pass away.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.840
You are looking down on the plan to fall in the Spastill Corporation,

00:55.840 --> 00:59.080
and the city of Follens be in the foreground.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.000
A happy city of 4500 people.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.160
You are looking down on a former of the residential section of Follensbeast.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.240
It is now being overcrowded with the business section.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.640
At that spot was once a swamp and an apple orchard.

01:14.640 --> 01:20.160
Today it has been crowded out with the growing business and expansion of the mill.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.480
There you are happy people down there.

01:22.480 --> 01:27.200
For a while we thought the town was going to be in sorrow.

01:27.200 --> 01:34.720
But today we are thankful to God that our industry has been saved.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.000
Bright below us is a typical home in Follensbeast.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.040
There is a family of four young children there.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.360
They are all happy.

01:42.360 --> 01:46.880
It is the 12th day after Christmas and they are getting rid of their Christmas tree.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.960
They truly had a real Christmas.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.640
Can I interrupt this happy family gathering?

01:53.640 --> 01:57.560
Tell me Mrs. Fiscardo, how did you and the children enjoy Christmas this year?

01:57.560 --> 01:59.800
We really enjoyed Christmas this year.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.320
It was one of the nicest we had.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.760
Everyone, every Christmas is nice.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.640
But this is really the nicest.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.600
The children enjoyed it.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.320
They got everything they wanted.

02:11.320 --> 02:16.920
In the two older girls, they were old enough to realize the situation that the mill was

02:16.920 --> 02:23.400
in and when they found out the news, they were pretty tickled about it.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.080
I asked everybody else in the family what was the best present they got for Christmas?

02:28.080 --> 02:29.360
Judy got a stove.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.240
What was your best Christmas present?

02:31.240 --> 02:35.720
The best Christmas present I got here is when I got the news that our mill was going

02:35.720 --> 02:37.640
to be established here in Follensbeast.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.160
Now I can go right ahead and make plans for my family in the future.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.960
What would have happened if the mill closed down?

02:43.960 --> 02:47.960
Sir, I think this town here has been a ghost town.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.960
The people here I am as and after being here all our lives have been lost concerning

02:50.960 --> 03:00.080
myself to say it wouldn't been worth staying here.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.160
As you all know, this happened a few short months ago.

03:03.160 --> 03:07.080
We learned that our plant was big move to Dalson, Alabama.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.760
At that time we decided that we should have a committee.

03:10.760 --> 03:11.760
We should do something.

03:11.760 --> 03:15.760
So a citizens committee was formed.

03:15.760 --> 03:22.880
Today, children is a great day in our lives.

03:22.880 --> 03:29.240
This is the day that we meet Cyrus Eaton, the man who saved our town, our mill, our home,

03:29.240 --> 03:36.440
our school, is a great day in our lives because it means so much to each and every one of us.

03:36.440 --> 03:40.560
We are going down to the mill and we are going to give Cyrus Eaton a hearted grieving to

03:40.560 --> 03:43.280
show him how happy we really are.

03:43.280 --> 03:48.600
Before we go, let's stand and sing the first verse of America the Beautiful.

03:48.600 --> 03:56.480
That's a good song for so appropriate a time to show that we have fought for what we wanted

03:56.480 --> 03:58.080
and we have won.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.120
This could only happen in America, let's stand.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.280
Good morning, what's your name?

04:46.280 --> 04:47.280
John Berry.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.280
John, how long have you been here?

04:50.280 --> 04:51.280
Twenty-seven years.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.280
You're about one of the oldest ones in the plant, I guess, huh?

04:54.280 --> 04:56.280
No, there's a lot more than I am here.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.280
You're a medium time, too, huh?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.280
Yeah, medium time.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.280
How did you feel when you first started the news that they were going to sell the plants?

05:02.280 --> 05:05.280
Well, look bad for the boys working here.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.280
The ones that got their property.

05:09.280 --> 05:15.280
I think to see more of this marvelous community.

05:15.280 --> 05:22.280
We'll accomplish that if we all pitch in there.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.280
Very much.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.280
I ask, certainly, Davis.

05:28.280 --> 05:38.280
I am Frank Basel, Mayor of the City of Fallen Bay.

05:38.280 --> 05:44.280
Tonight, I am one of the happiest men in the whole United States.

05:45.280 --> 05:54.280
John Brown, John, to the country, to the old town, like the cold.

05:54.280 --> 06:11.280
John Brown, John Berry, John, by old tree, John Brown, John Berry, John, by old tree.

John Brown.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.280
John Brown.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.280
In the Father's land, four acres stay in.

06:38.280 --> 06:44.280
Blesseth their Lord and be thy gifts, which we are about to receive from my down teaching

06:44.280 --> 06:51.280
and my Lord, amen.

06:51.280 --> 06:56.280
In the Father's land, holy, gay, stay in.
