00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, highly significant developments occurred this

00:07.000 --> 00:11.960
week in connection with the general subject of civil rights. Some of them in the Senate

00:11.960 --> 00:17.200
of the United States, but perhaps the most significant occurred in Knoxville, Tennessee,

00:17.200 --> 00:22.240
and the trial of the so-called Clinton case. What happened there, and we've heard a whole

00:22.240 --> 00:27.920
lot about it on the floor of the Senate this week, undoubtedly had its effect on the discussions

00:27.920 --> 00:32.280
on the floor of the Senate and elsewhere in the nation. As you know, there has been

00:32.280 --> 00:38.440
much loose talk these days about southern juries would not conflict those charged with violating

00:38.440 --> 00:43.520
civil rights. That is the reason that there has been an attempt in connection with the

00:43.520 --> 00:49.760
legislation which the House passed and which the Senate is now considering to deny the trial

00:49.760 --> 00:55.520
of the right of a trial by jury. I have a pause there, of course. Of course, juries

00:55.520 --> 01:01.040
are sometimes make mistakes, and they are sometimes prejudiced. But I was reading a

01:01.040 --> 01:07.400
paragraph not so long ago from a book by Justice Woody Moe Dougies, which describes juries,

01:07.400 --> 01:13.040
their strength, as well as their shortcomings, about as well as anything I have seen. This

01:13.040 --> 01:19.040
paragraph states, as jury reflects the attitudes and the more rays of the community from which

01:19.040 --> 01:25.560
it is drawn. It lives only for the day and does justice according to its light. The group

01:25.560 --> 01:32.000
of 12 who are drawn to hear a case, make the decision, and melt away. It is not present

01:32.000 --> 01:38.280
the next day to be criticized. It is the one governmental agency that has no ambition. It

01:38.280 --> 01:43.960
is as human as the people who make it up. It is sometimes the victim of passion. But it

01:43.960 --> 01:50.960
also takes the sharp edges off a law and uses conscience to ameliorate a hardship. Since

01:50.960 --> 01:56.880
it is obvious and from the community, it gives the law an acceptance which critics of

01:56.880 --> 02:04.340
judges could not do. As the end of Justice Dougies' quotation, whether turned in jury by

02:04.340 --> 02:10.840
convicting the troublemaker and rabble rouse or John Casper and six of his court offenders,

02:10.840 --> 02:17.360
show that a tenancy jury takes its oath seriously. And back in victim some and acquitting others,

02:17.360 --> 02:23.080
they showed that they were carefully considering and sorting out facts. Furthermore, I think

02:23.080 --> 02:29.200
that the last sentence in Justice Dougies' remarks, it gives the law an acceptance which

02:29.200 --> 02:35.960
critics of judges could not do. It is important to remember in civil rights pieces which have

02:35.960 --> 02:41.800
a very important result on the attitudes of the community. As this broadcast is being

02:41.800 --> 02:47.680
prepared, we are debating the jury amendment. As you know, I filed an amendment which I discussed

02:47.680 --> 02:54.160
with you last week and which I think is workable. Senator O'Manney of Wyoming has filed a different

02:54.160 --> 02:59.360
type of amendment, but he has now abandoned his and adopted the same general approach that

02:59.360 --> 03:04.920
I do. I think it is safe to predict that the Senate will adopt an amendment similar

03:04.920 --> 03:09.040
to the one that we have been talking about, particularly since the end of the outcome of

03:09.040 --> 03:15.200
a sentence case. The amendment that we have been talking about retains the authority of

03:15.200 --> 03:19.880
the court to enforce its own orders without a jury, which I think is necessary for the

03:19.880 --> 03:25.760
dignity and for the authority of the court. But in any case where the person is to be criminally

03:25.760 --> 03:32.640
prosecuted, a jury is required. Earlier this week, the Senate voted to remove most of

03:32.640 --> 03:38.480
part three of the civil rights bill. I voted for that move. I believe that with the court's

03:38.480 --> 03:43.880
refreying of general problems, that it would be best not to attempt any new legislation

03:43.880 --> 03:49.320
in addition to the right to vote. In the final analysis, the bill that the Senate will

03:49.320 --> 03:55.560
pass, I believe, will be principally a right to vote bill. This, I think, is worthwhile.

03:55.560 --> 04:01.640
It will strengthen the democracy. With an amendment such as I have discussed, it will protect

04:01.640 --> 04:08.840
our basic rights to a trial by jury. Under these circumstances, I am far the bill. I do

04:08.840 --> 04:13.360
not know how long they debate on the civil rights bill will continue. Some are guessing

04:13.360 --> 04:19.320
all the 15 of course it remains yet to see whether any fellow busards are going to be

04:19.320 --> 04:24.840
forthcoming. I doubt that there will be a fellow bus through the bill that is limited

04:24.840 --> 04:31.840
to the protection and the securing of a person's right to vote, which we all believe in,

04:31.840 --> 04:36.160
and which we feel that people ought to have, all citizens ought to have, if they meet

04:36.160 --> 04:41.560
the following conditions in the state as to age and so forth. That's all for now until

04:41.560 --> 04:43.320
this time. Next week, goodbye.
