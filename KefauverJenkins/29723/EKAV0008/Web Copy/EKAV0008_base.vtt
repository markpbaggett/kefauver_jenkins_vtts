00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, for a long time I've wanted to have this distinguished

00:08.000 --> 00:14.360
man on our program, not to meet you because he has met and most of you in Tennessee will

00:14.360 --> 00:17.760
be listening and watching this program know him.

00:17.760 --> 00:23.760
Our Senate, our majority leader of the United States Senate, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.760
Lyndon, it certainly is good to have you on program.

00:27.760 --> 00:32.080
I'm happy to introduce you to my friends in Tennessee.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.080
Yes, I appreciate this courtesy.

00:34.080 --> 00:38.440
I've enjoyed serving with you very much for ten years in the house and not twelve years

00:38.440 --> 00:39.440
in the Senate.

00:39.440 --> 00:45.680
And Texas owes so much to Tennessee that I always take every opportunity that I can to

00:45.680 --> 00:48.000
visit with the people of your great state.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
You certainly do.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
You've been to see us often.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.560
You've always supported projects and we're interested in such as the TVA and everything

00:55.560 --> 00:59.880
that comes up in the Senate affecting Tennessee's welfare.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.880
You've always been far.

01:00.880 --> 01:06.320
I could take all of this program, ladies and gentlemen, talking about the outstanding

01:06.320 --> 01:13.240
record of Senator Lyndon Johnson, but he is accomplished of his intelligence, his ability,

01:13.240 --> 01:14.240
his courage.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.800
I think it's the first to say that he is a great majority leader.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.880
He has made an outstanding record.

01:21.880 --> 01:25.000
He has accomplished much during his years.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.560
He has given the party fine leadership in the United States Senate.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.840
He is one of America's great leaders.

01:33.840 --> 01:39.360
I know that he wouldn't want me to say this because this is not a political occasion, but

01:39.360 --> 01:42.000
he may be the Democratic nominee.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.080
He may be the next president of the United States and he will occupy, worthily and keepably

01:49.080 --> 01:51.240
any office to which he may be selected.

01:51.240 --> 02:02.160
So now Lyndon, the very progressive and very responsible program we came into the session

02:02.160 --> 02:09.280
by first considering the clean elections bill and modernizing all the election machinery

02:09.280 --> 02:11.280
for the first time since 1928.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.720
In addition, we passed the Constitutional Amendment to giving the right of franchise district

02:16.720 --> 02:18.720
bill.

02:18.720 --> 02:26.240
Then we considered the most comprehensive educational bill that the Commerce has ever acted

02:26.240 --> 02:29.960
upon, and then we presented it for some time.

02:29.960 --> 02:36.320
We passed a bill that would give material aid to raising salaries of our teachers and

02:36.320 --> 02:43.360
also provide a considerable aid for additional classroom construction in connection with our

02:43.360 --> 02:46.880
schools without any federal control.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.720
Well, that was a great legislative accomplishment of which you were largely responsible and

02:50.720 --> 02:51.880
not people in Tennessee.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.720
A great part of them are very much interested in this bill.

02:55.720 --> 03:01.560
Well, I, in the last few weeks, I spent some time with Chancellor Addenar and Prime Minister

03:01.560 --> 03:05.960
MacMillan and both of these great leaders of great countries told me that they thought

03:05.960 --> 03:10.920
the most important nation facing the free world today was out of education and we just

03:10.920 --> 03:13.560
can't be second best in that.

03:13.560 --> 03:18.100
We then spent two months considering the civil rights bill and while we didn't pass the

03:18.100 --> 03:23.840
bill, satisfied everybody, every conceivable issue that could be presented in connection

03:23.840 --> 03:30.440
that bill was discussed, pro and con, fairly reasonably intelligently, and the Senate

03:30.440 --> 03:34.920
finally acted by passing the bill 82 to 18.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.240
We have passed a mind-take.

03:37.240 --> 03:42.600
So, I'd say a voting right bill to assure the right of everybody ever qualified citizens

03:42.600 --> 03:44.400
to be able to vote.

03:44.400 --> 03:49.800
That is right and it does not make a conquered province out of the South and we hope that there's

03:49.800 --> 03:54.640
nothing punitive in it and I believe under the circumstances it was the most reasonable

03:54.640 --> 04:00.360
and fair bill at the heart of which was voting rights that could have been passed and if

04:00.360 --> 04:05.520
no action had been taken, I'm fearful that more extreme measures would have been passed

04:05.520 --> 04:08.240
at other times.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.840
But I you go on, Lyndon, what are the plans for the future?

04:11.840 --> 04:13.880
When do you think we'll get away from Washington?

04:13.880 --> 04:17.840
I think it will get out of here just before the convention.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.880
We have a good housing bill, we'll have to pass, medical care bill, we'll have to pass,

04:21.880 --> 04:26.840
social security, amendments, we'll have to pass, a farm bill that we'll act upon but I

04:26.840 --> 04:31.000
believe we'll be able to do all those things and still adjourn prior to the convention.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Well, thank you very much, Lyndon Johnson and ladies and gentlemen, you have a...

04:35.800 --> 04:41.200
Seeing and been listening to a lot of America's and our nation's great leaders and great men,

04:41.200 --> 04:43.200
thank you very much Lyndon.

04:43.200 --> 05:06.960
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we all know that the defense of our country

05:06.960 --> 05:12.880
and it's offensive, we should ever, unportion, get into a war, it depends to a considerable

05:12.880 --> 05:17.960
extent upon missiles, what kind of missiles we have and the progress that we are making

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
in them.

05:18.960 --> 05:25.400
I learned as a member of the Armed Services Committee when I was a member that Lieutenant

05:25.400 --> 05:34.720
Colonel, I mean Colonel Maurice Buck Rogers, Buck and Colonel Bill Smith were about the

05:34.720 --> 05:41.160
most informative people on the subject of Army missiles that we have in our services

05:41.160 --> 05:46.280
and they are very kind and consented to come and be with us today.

05:46.280 --> 05:52.560
Colonel Smith, your specialty I believe is the surface-to-surface missiles, is that right?

05:52.560 --> 05:57.040
That is correct, sir, I am in the surface-to-surface missile business which is an extension

05:57.040 --> 05:58.040
of field artillery.

05:58.040 --> 06:03.720
These are some of the surface-to-surface missiles here that you have and this is the

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
missile.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.720
What is this one?

06:05.720 --> 06:06.720
That is the honest John.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.480
Honest John, and how about the one back here?

06:09.480 --> 06:12.720
That is the longest-range Army missile, the Redstone.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.720
May I down at Huntsville, Alabama, I do believe you.

06:15.720 --> 06:20.560
Well, how do you think we are getting along in our surface-to-surface missiles?

06:20.560 --> 06:25.760
We feel so that we have a very fine family of surface-to-surface missiles in existence

06:25.760 --> 06:29.520
and we feel that even better developments are coming along.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.680
Of course, the missiles which are a far-off those controlled by the Army, namely the tactical

06:33.680 --> 06:34.680
missiles.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.280
Those missiles which must move and be in constant support of the field Army.

06:38.280 --> 06:43.240
You mean once you care right along with like tanks and guns and things of that sort?

06:43.240 --> 06:44.240
That is correct.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.600
They must be of high mobility.

06:46.600 --> 06:52.160
And how about a solid fuel propellant?

06:52.160 --> 06:53.800
Is that in the program?

06:53.800 --> 06:55.360
Is that more mobile than that?

06:55.360 --> 07:00.640
That is, sir, as a matter of fact, these two missiles here both have solid propellant.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.680
And it is a goal in which we strive.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.720
The replacement missiles for the corporal, namely the sergeant and the replacement for the

07:07.720 --> 07:10.880
Redstone, the purging, will have solid propellant.

07:10.880 --> 07:15.320
We like solid propellant because it makes it much easier to handle than the field.

07:15.320 --> 07:19.880
It gives the opportunity of handing the soldier a round of ammunition just almost as simple

07:19.880 --> 07:20.880
as a rifle bullet.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.880
Well, that's fine.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.400
I'll be back with you in a minute, Colonel Bill Smith.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.680
Colonel Buck Rogers, what is your specialty?

07:27.680 --> 07:30.760
My specialty, sir, is surface to air missiles.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.680
In other words, surface to strike something in the air.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
Yes, sir.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.400
The right is barring from the ground to strike an interceptor or an air to surface missile

07:39.400 --> 07:40.400
and destroy it.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.880
It might be carrying weapons to work our country.

07:42.880 --> 07:47.360
Now, that's a father defense of our country against tax by enemy planes.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
That is correct.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.840
Now, what are our air to surface missiles?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.600
What are these missiles we have here?

07:52.600 --> 07:56.440
Well, the surface to air missiles that we show here are the Nike AJAX, which went on

07:56.440 --> 08:01.440
sight in the defense of the continental United States in 1953.

08:01.440 --> 08:07.640
They improved the Nike Hercules, which went on sight in June 1958.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.960
Well, we've heard a whole lot about in some missile fields that we got behind the Soviet

08:11.960 --> 08:14.600
Union and we're trying to catch up.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.840
But how about in the surface to air missiles?

08:16.840 --> 08:18.200
How do you think we stand?

08:18.200 --> 08:23.920
I think that we have the finest surface to air missiles in the world today.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.920
And our program is going ahead.

08:25.920 --> 08:26.920
Good.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.920
Yes, sir.

08:27.920 --> 08:34.040
We've heard a lot of doubt since the unfortunate U2 incident over which Mr. Kruishoff is

08:34.040 --> 08:39.360
trying to make so much propaganda that some skepticism as to whether they were able to

08:39.360 --> 08:45.480
shoot down a plane at 65,000 feet of, what would be our capabilities in connection with

08:45.480 --> 08:47.200
it, no matter of that kind?

08:47.200 --> 08:53.560
Well, Senator, we have demonstrated in the firing that flight stands proving ground the capability

08:53.560 --> 09:01.520
of hitting a target at an altitude of 73,000 feet, flying at a speed of 2100 miles per hour.

09:01.520 --> 09:06.440
Now, according to the newspaper reports, this is greater than a speed which the U2 is flying.

09:06.440 --> 09:11.480
Time, of course, they don't know the facts about the U2 and what they may never know, but

09:11.480 --> 09:13.800
anyway, we do have that time of capability.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.800
Yes, sir.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.960
As a matter of fact, we can fire to an altitude greater than 100,000 feet.

09:17.960 --> 09:22.600
Well, we're mighty proud of the fact that so much of the development and work in connection

09:22.600 --> 09:25.200
with the surface to surface missiles has been done.

09:25.200 --> 09:31.480
It hunts well our balance with a lot of activities and tonnesty of plants as you so well know

09:31.480 --> 09:32.480
Colonel Smith.

09:32.480 --> 09:37.680
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can be proud of the activities of our defense

09:37.680 --> 09:39.280
department in these two areas.

09:39.280 --> 09:43.760
And we're certainly grateful to you, Colonel Rogers and Colonel Smith, for coming and being

09:43.760 --> 09:44.760
with us today.

09:44.760 --> 09:49.280
That's all until next week at this time.

09:49.280 --> 10:05.280
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I know that you've all been following very

10:05.280 --> 10:10.840
closely the President, a White House conference on children and youth, which is being held here

10:10.840 --> 10:13.160
in Washington this week.

10:13.160 --> 10:17.720
Today in the studio, we have some of the distinguished delegates from Tennessee to this most important

10:17.720 --> 10:20.040
conference for the youth of our nation.

10:20.040 --> 10:25.480
And I will introduce people who are here from my right to the left.

10:25.480 --> 10:34.480
Dr. Roy Baker, who is the Commissioner of Mental Health in the State of Tennessee with

10:34.480 --> 10:38.240
us and very important in this conference.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.600
Next on my right is now the delegate to the conference.

10:40.600 --> 10:44.760
She has been following very closely in the newspaper on television and the radio of my

10:44.760 --> 10:45.760
wife Nancy.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.280
What do you think about the conference, Nancy?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.520
Well, I'm tremendously interested.

10:50.520 --> 10:54.520
I'm convinced from all I've had that the mother's place is in the home.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.520
Keep the children busy.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.520
I find something for you.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.520
You can take a very good experience with four of them.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.720
Great experience.

11:01.720 --> 11:08.400
And on my left is a professor of Poop-Dar of Central High School at Chattanooga, who has

11:08.400 --> 11:11.400
been a student of these problems for a long, long time.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.200
It's good to have you with us at Poop.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.200
Thank you.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.120
Dr. Raymond Ballister of Nashville, who is one of the managers of the Tennessee Parent

11:18.120 --> 11:19.120
Teachers Association.

11:19.120 --> 11:25.240
As both of you start with you, well, Poop, tell us what this conference is all about.

11:25.240 --> 11:30.000
On the center of 7,000 people here, some children.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.840
Senator, there are approximately 7,000 delegates from the different states and 500 from foreign

11:37.840 --> 11:39.840
countries.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.760
Each day, there are five assemblies.

11:42.760 --> 11:50.240
Theme assemblies held, 18 forums and 210 workshops daily.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.440
Each person participates in each one of them.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.880
I understand that Dr. Ballister, you have your large meetings in the morning and then

11:57.880 --> 12:00.280
division meetings in the afternoon.

12:00.280 --> 12:04.800
It represents two or three hundred conferences going on at the same time as what it amounts

12:04.800 --> 12:11.640
to that several small groups get together and discuss specific topics after having received

12:11.640 --> 12:15.600
some stimulation and background information from the general session.

12:15.600 --> 12:21.480
Now we had a great conference like this in 1950 and this is the one following that conference

12:21.480 --> 12:22.480
of 1960.

12:22.480 --> 12:27.240
Dr. Baker, the president addressed the first meeting of the conference, didn't he?

12:27.240 --> 12:28.240
Yes, he did.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.240
Tell us about it.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.720
You're a question of his speech.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.720
Very inspiring talk, I think.

12:35.120 --> 12:40.360
This was very well attended, of course, being the first session on Sunday night.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.840
And I think that the president's talk set the tone for the whole conference, really.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.840
Yes, it was.

12:45.840 --> 12:51.760
It was a splendid dress that he made and Mr. Dyer, how many are here from Tennessee?

12:51.760 --> 12:57.360
I think I've never seen a better cross section of more splendid people.

12:57.360 --> 13:02.560
Senator, I believe we have approximately one hundred delegates from the state of Tennessee.

13:02.560 --> 13:08.880
I believe 64 have been appointed by the governor directly and I believe about thirty-five to

13:08.880 --> 13:13.640
forty have been appointed by the various organizations throughout the nation.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.160
And a very large proportion of being young people.

13:16.160 --> 13:20.640
Yes, that's important so they can talk about their problems themselves.

13:20.640 --> 13:26.760
Well, let me ask, now we are not just talking about opportunities for youth generally and

13:26.760 --> 13:32.080
not just talking about what can be done relative to the three or three and a half percent.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.080
You have to be juvenile, the length of it.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.480
But we are living in a new world, aren't we?

13:36.480 --> 13:42.800
A fast moving world in which all values and I mean, which are methods of yesterday might

13:42.800 --> 13:43.800
not exactly fit today.

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
Is that right, Dr. Baker?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.600
That's certainly correct.

13:46.600 --> 13:51.840
Changes are just moving at such a terrific pace.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.840
It's hard for youth to know which values to embrace.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.440
Which values adults should pass on.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.920
Adults don't know either.

13:59.920 --> 14:05.440
Well Nancy, what do you think about in the summertime about keeping kids busy?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.440
Is that so?

14:06.440 --> 14:09.040
Well, I think it's terribly important.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.640
How do you do it?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.440
Well, they have cats.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.440
I think cats are tremendously helpful.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.800
And they are so much interesting.

14:17.800 --> 14:22.120
We found a very good thing when David wanted to get some money that we let him collect

14:22.120 --> 14:25.240
all the newspapers and take him down to the junk dealer and sell them.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.560
That certainly keeps him very, very busy.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.560
Well, there are so many things that we could talk about, but I know out of this great conference

14:31.560 --> 14:36.400
will come much good work with recommendations for legislation, increased interest back

14:36.400 --> 14:41.480
home and much good for our nation will be the result of this White House conference

14:41.480 --> 14:42.480
on youth.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.760
Thank you very much, Nancy and gentlemen, for being with me.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.760
That's all for now.

14:46.760 --> 14:53.760
Goodbye, and we'll next week.

14:55.240 --> 15:05.560
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

15:05.560 --> 15:10.720
This is a very exciting week in Washington because this is a cherry blossom week.

15:10.720 --> 15:15.880
The Tennessee State Society of Washington, its president and officers and members,

15:15.880 --> 15:21.560
chose the Tennessee cherry blossom princess who is with us today.

15:21.560 --> 15:24.840
Mr. Joanna Evans of Smithville, Tennessee.

15:24.840 --> 15:31.160
It certainly is wonderful to have you with us, Joanna.

15:31.160 --> 15:36.880
And we also honored in having her distinguished father, Congressman Joe Evans of a fourth

15:36.880 --> 15:41.680
congressional district who has been serving in the House of Representatives for almost

15:41.680 --> 15:44.760
14 years with great honor and dignity.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.760
Well, thank you, Ed.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.600
It's nice to be here and to bring Joanna along.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.280
I certainly appreciate you bringing.

15:49.280 --> 15:56.560
But Joanna, tell us about the, you got a Vanderbilt out there, but you don't.

15:56.560 --> 16:00.200
And I hear you're a very outstanding student.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.720
She made wonderful grades and can we prove it by you, Joe.

16:04.720 --> 16:09.040
She's always made better grades than me.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.280
Joanna, you're a junior at Vanderbilt.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.080
Now, here you're president of the E.O.P.I.S.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.920
authority for next year.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.920
I have a daughter at Vanderbilt and how about Linda?

16:21.920 --> 16:22.920
I know you don't know.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.920
She's now a little sister.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.920
Well, she's not proud of you.

16:26.920 --> 16:35.480
Well, friends, when Mr. Joanna Evans came to Washington, on Sunday nights, he was met by the

16:35.480 --> 16:41.160
president of the Tennessee State Society, a large group of Tennesseans, in honor of our

16:41.160 --> 16:44.160
beautiful charming cherry blossom princess, Tennessee.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.160
Now, tell us about the probals from this week, Joanna.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.160
Well, the meeting was the most spectacular.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.160
At the time, I wasn't very charming.

16:51.160 --> 16:56.160
I had rained in the face and everybody had umbrellas and cameras were all over.

16:56.160 --> 17:00.160
And the next day, we met our escorts through the Univac machine.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.160
Yes, I was on the Monday.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.160
On Monday, yes.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.160
And you've been very busy all week.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.160
Oh, very.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.160
And then what happened on Tuesday, Joanna?

17:09.160 --> 17:11.160
Tuesday, we had some.

17:11.160 --> 17:16.160
I was the official opening of the festival, providing the Japanese stone lanterns out of the

17:16.160 --> 17:17.160
ambassador's shoulder.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.160
About the ambassador of Japan.

17:19.160 --> 17:24.160
And then on Wednesday night, I believe, I choose you.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.160
You had a great ball with all your sword.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.160
Tuesday night, what's the name?

17:28.160 --> 17:32.160
Tennessee State Society's ball of the Tennessee State.

17:32.160 --> 17:37.160
And then the official crowning of the queen is on Friday night.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.160
Friday night.

17:38.160 --> 17:52.160
And I'd explain that if Merritt went exclusively in choosing, I'm sure that Joanna would be the queen of the overall queen of the chairblossom festival, but they've turned a wheel in it.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.160
That's not exactly crazy.

17:53.160 --> 18:00.160
And we hope that the wheel will end in the right place and Joanna will be the national queen.

18:00.160 --> 18:05.160
Then Joanna, you're going back to the national extendable.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.160
Let me run deep into the water board.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.160
I'm a bright.

18:09.160 --> 18:15.160
And Joe, this is a great, great, great week for you and Anne.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.160
Yes, just we're delighted to have Joanna with us.

18:17.160 --> 18:20.160
We are very honored that the society has selected her.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.160
But most of all, we've enjoyed having the week visit with her.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.160
And I understand just smart her, Brent Forlund, may be coming up to.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.160
Well, he always likes to make trips, but he couldn't make this to me.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.160
The society's not to come this time.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.160
We're very sorry that he didn't come.

18:32.160 --> 18:37.160
But Joanna, you have left for a fine student to French too, aren't you?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.160
I'm scared he didn't.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.160
Because you got a fine slice to you?

18:41.160 --> 18:43.160
Yes, 13 summer when we were in France.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.160
These days we're in French family and enjoy it very much.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.160
And what are you going to do this summer, Joanna?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.160
Oh, because they haven't worked this summer.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.160
You mean your father's going to make you work this summer?

18:53.160 --> 18:56.160
What are you going to do working? I'll get the following way.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.160
What are you going to be doing this summer, Joanna?

18:58.160 --> 19:00.160
Well, she has lots of interest.

19:00.160 --> 19:04.160
She likes newspaper work, because she can find a place where she might get a job with a newspaper.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.160
That's what her interests are in writing.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.160
But I suspect you'd be campaigning for me.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.160
Well, Joe, you don't have any opposition.

19:10.160 --> 19:13.160
So, you will need it.
