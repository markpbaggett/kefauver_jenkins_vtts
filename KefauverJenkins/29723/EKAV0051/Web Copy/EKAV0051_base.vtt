00:00.000 --> 00:18.520
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we had a very historic occasion in the United

00:18.520 --> 00:24.320
States Senate this week when the two distinguished senators from the new state of Hawaii, the

00:24.320 --> 00:30.280
beautiful state of Hawaii, where introduced and sworn in as members of the United States

00:30.280 --> 00:31.280
Senate.

00:31.280 --> 00:36.120
And I'm very happy to have them here with me on this occasion to introduce them to

00:36.120 --> 00:38.640
the people of Tennessee.

00:38.640 --> 00:46.480
On my right first, I will introduce Senator Haram Fong, who is the first person of Chinese

00:46.480 --> 00:48.920
descent who has ever been a member of the Congress.

00:48.920 --> 00:52.480
It's a great pleasure to have you on this program, Senator Fong.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.880
My pleasure, Senator Kefawa, to be here with you.

00:54.880 --> 00:55.880
Thank you.

00:55.880 --> 01:01.640
And we have a special interest in the Senator on my left, Oran Long.

01:01.640 --> 01:09.200
He went to school at Johnson Bible College near Knoxville, Tennessee, and he came back as

01:09.200 --> 01:13.520
principal or superintendent of that college, or sometime later.

01:13.520 --> 01:20.120
And he married a very lovely Tennessee girl, Mr. Geneva Rule.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.120
You're as good to have you, Oran.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.640
Say something to the people of—we consider you our third Senator, you know.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.640
Thank you, Estes.

01:27.640 --> 01:32.640
It's a great privilege to be here.

01:32.640 --> 01:39.940
Senator Long was the governor of Hawaii for a time, and he is a member of the Democratic

01:39.940 --> 01:40.940
Party.

01:40.940 --> 01:48.180
When you're coming down to see us in Tennessee, Oran, we expect to spend our vacation in

01:48.180 --> 01:51.700
Knoxville just as soon as the session adjourns, Senator.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.140
Well, wonderful, Alvie, right there.

01:53.140 --> 01:54.140
You're a better place.

01:54.140 --> 01:57.780
I hope that you'll cool it off a little bit before we get there.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.380
Well, it'll be cool in the mountains.

02:00.380 --> 02:01.380
That's right.

02:01.380 --> 02:05.380
And we'll go up to Gablinburg and Smoky Mountain National Park.

02:05.380 --> 02:09.580
Senator Fong, you graduated, I believe, from Harvard Law School.

02:09.580 --> 02:16.740
Is that a great lawyer served in the Air Force in Italy as a major during the war?

02:16.740 --> 02:18.740
Air Force in Hickenfield.

02:18.740 --> 02:19.740
Yes.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.740
Have you been—have you ever been to Tennessee?

02:22.740 --> 02:29.500
Yes, I've passed with Tennessee approximately ten years ago on my way from New Orleans to

02:29.500 --> 02:30.500
Washington.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.500
On the train?

02:31.500 --> 02:32.500
Yes, on the train.

02:32.500 --> 02:37.540
Well, we want you to stay longer this—we want you to come down and see the TVA and stay

02:37.540 --> 02:39.940
here as a real visit sometime.

02:39.940 --> 02:40.940
I'll accept that.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.060
How did—which one of you are the senior Senator?

02:43.060 --> 02:44.980
How did you decide that?

02:44.980 --> 02:51.980
Well, since the long gave me the title, he flipped the coin and he yelled heads and tail

02:51.980 --> 02:52.980
king.

02:52.980 --> 02:53.980
Is that right, Oran?

02:53.980 --> 02:54.980
That's correct.

02:54.980 --> 02:59.580
Well, and then we had a very unusual situation.

02:59.580 --> 03:06.020
You were just both elected as usual, as a case of Alaska also as senators.

03:06.020 --> 03:11.020
Then you have—we have to go through a process of deciding which would be the—well, you'd

03:11.020 --> 03:14.220
have a two-year term, a four-year term, or a six-year term.

03:14.220 --> 03:16.220
How was that decided Senator Long?

03:16.220 --> 03:21.100
That was decided by drawing.

03:21.100 --> 03:28.020
By a flip of the coin, I had the privilege of drawing first as between six years and a

03:28.020 --> 03:29.020
blank.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.020
I drew the blank.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.260
And so, that's a little long after six years.

03:32.260 --> 03:33.260
I had no six years.

03:33.260 --> 03:36.860
He left on one half of me.

03:36.860 --> 03:42.380
And so you have a six-year term Senator Long, and you have a—and then I had to draw

03:42.380 --> 03:45.980
as between the two-year and the four-year term.

03:45.980 --> 03:46.980
And luck was wet.

03:46.980 --> 03:47.980
Me, I drew the four-year term.

03:47.980 --> 03:48.980
Well, that's fine.

03:48.980 --> 03:52.780
So everybody's very happy about it.

03:52.780 --> 03:58.380
So, and Senator Long is a Republican and Senator Long is a Democrat.

03:58.380 --> 04:04.500
Well, what's your impression about the United States Senate Senator Long?

04:04.500 --> 04:06.380
My impression that I've got a lot to learn.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.980
I'm going to keep up with it.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.980
And I'm learning very, very slowly.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.580
When you go back to how old you went to Congress, when the—

04:12.580 --> 04:13.580
Yes, I will.

04:13.580 --> 04:16.060
If it ever gets over, I don't know when it'll get over.

04:16.060 --> 04:17.860
You think you'll get over soon?

04:17.860 --> 04:19.060
A lot of no-one's entered the ladder.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.060
No, I'm Fred, I express an opinion.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.060
What's your impression?

04:22.060 --> 04:25.020
What are your plans for the future, Aaron?

04:25.020 --> 04:31.660
My outstanding impression is the great friendliness of the men and the one lady that makes up

04:31.660 --> 04:35.900
the membership of 98, or 98 constituents.

04:35.900 --> 04:36.900
Wonderful.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.500
Well, I associated with them.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.940
Well, that's very wonderful of you to say that.

04:40.940 --> 04:46.900
Well, I certainly appreciate you being on the program and I'm happy to have introduced

04:46.900 --> 04:48.780
you to the people of my state.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.780
We'll look for you in Tennessee sometime.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.060
That's all until next week at this time.

04:53.060 --> 04:53.900
Thank you very much.
