00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
This is Senator Estes' keep-off for a Tennessee.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Four years ago, you struck a great blow for good government in the state of Illinois,

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
when you elected Adelaide Stephenson as governor and Sherwood Dixon as Lieutenant Governor.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
They have done a great job particularly in the field of law enforcement.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
About two years ago, after the conclusion of our Senate Crime Committee hearings here in Chicago,

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
I had good reason to highly commend them upon the fine and courageous effort that they had done

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
to suppress crime and corruption in this state.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
I know that Sherwood Dixon will continue on that good job.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
A partnership now between Adelaide Stephenson as president and Sherwood Dixon as governor

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
would be a great thing for the people of this country and of the state of Illinois.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Keep up the cleanup.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Elect Sherwood Dixon, Governor of Illinois.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Both Tuesday, November 4th.
