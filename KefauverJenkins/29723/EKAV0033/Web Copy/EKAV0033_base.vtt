00:00.000 --> 00:16.860
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, without a doubt the most important development

00:16.860 --> 00:23.320
in Washington and in the world is the decision of President Eisenhower and premier Nikita

00:23.320 --> 00:30.060
Kruzschtov to exchange visits in September and this fall. When this was announced it

00:30.060 --> 00:35.580
precipitated a flood of speculation all the way from full approval of the idea to

00:35.580 --> 00:41.020
outright opposition and indignation. Some feel that this country is letting down the

00:41.020 --> 00:47.720
people of the free nations who have sided with us against the threat of communism. Some

00:47.720 --> 00:55.360
other people argue that people in the captive nations behind the iron curtain will feel

00:55.360 --> 01:00.880
that they have been abandoned and forgotten about with this new show of friendship. There

01:00.880 --> 01:05.400
is also concern that some incident might happen to Mr. Kruzschtov when he was here that would

01:05.400 --> 01:12.000
make tensions worse rather than easing them. We are all fully aware of these viewpoints,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.480
but I have faith in the sound, common sense and judgment of our people. I do not think

01:17.480 --> 01:22.960
that Mr. Kruzschtov's visit to this country will pull the eyes over any of our people. I

01:22.960 --> 01:29.320
do think that this is a chance to show Mr. Kruzschtov the prosperity and the strength of America

01:29.320 --> 01:36.520
and that it might give him a second sobering thought if he is laboring under any idea about

01:36.520 --> 01:42.440
our material strength or our spiritual stamina. I think that people of all nations of the world

01:42.440 --> 01:48.760
are acutely concerned with a nuclear threat that hangs over our heads. Our nation will spend

01:48.760 --> 01:54.840
more than $40 billion this year for missiles, for defense, for powdering, for guns. We would

01:54.840 --> 02:00.400
like to, we simply cannot go on with this kind of military expenditure. We would like to use

02:00.400 --> 02:07.280
some of this money for other and good social things, hospital schools and things that our

02:07.280 --> 02:13.640
people need. And the Cold War requires Russia to divert tremendous outlays from its economic

02:13.640 --> 02:22.440
development and to support of its large military commitments. The vision of destruction and death

02:22.440 --> 02:29.120
at a nuclear attack and counterattack would mean is a sober and terrifying one. The cold,

02:29.120 --> 02:35.200
hard fact is that there is no alternative to peace and this becomes more a more indescapable

02:35.200 --> 02:41.920
conclusion every day. Any avenue that can turn Premier Kruzschiff and the world away from the

02:41.920 --> 02:48.960
deadly march toward war is an avenue that we must and that we ought to explore. His visit to the

02:48.960 --> 02:55.760
United States and President Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union is that maybe one of these

02:55.760 --> 03:03.440
ways to turn the, turn the thoughts of the people of the world to other avenues and it's one

03:03.440 --> 03:09.040
that ought to be explored. You will note that the President intends to visit with the leaders of

03:09.040 --> 03:14.880
Western Europe before he goes to Moscow. And I think this is good. They naturally have a great

03:14.880 --> 03:21.120
many anxieties that he might, that some agreement might be made that would bind them, that they were not

03:21.120 --> 03:27.840
not advised of. And of course any major policy decision must be made in conjunction with our

03:28.800 --> 03:35.760
loyal allies of the West. After all this is a new course for the United States and for the world.

03:35.760 --> 03:41.040
And it should be explained to our allies and to the friends that we have in the non-committed

03:41.040 --> 03:46.720
nations of the world before any step is taken. And no great settlement I don't think is going to

03:46.720 --> 03:53.120
come from the exchange of visits of President Eisenhower and Mr. Kruzschiff. Such cannot result in

03:53.120 --> 03:59.520
independent action without the participation of our allies. But if nothing more results than

03:59.520 --> 04:05.600
the easing of tension and the relaxation of difficulties generated over the Berlin crisis,

04:06.240 --> 04:11.920
certainly we can say that some progress has been made. As long as we are talking, we are not

04:11.920 --> 04:19.680
fighting and we are not dying. And so I welcome the opportunity. Our people now have of showing Mr.

04:19.680 --> 04:26.320
Kruzschiff our wonderful country and what we have here in the United States. And I have suggested to

04:26.320 --> 04:33.280
the President that Mr. Kruzschiff's list of American visits include the Tennessee Valley Authority

04:33.280 --> 04:38.640
region where he was the refined example of democracy and action and I know personally that he's

04:38.640 --> 04:44.560
interested. Also that he go to Nashville and see the state capital and hear the grand old

04:44.560 --> 04:52.480
operating visit the Hermitage. That's all for now. Thank you very much.
