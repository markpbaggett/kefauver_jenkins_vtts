00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I'm very happy to have on this program today

00:07.920 --> 00:15.040
with me a very good friend of mine and one of our ableist and most progressive and hard-hitting

00:15.040 --> 00:16.040
senators.

00:16.040 --> 00:22.920
A senator from Texas, Mr. Ralph, Senator Ralph Yarbrough, and thank you very much Ralph for

00:22.920 --> 00:24.720
coming and being with us today.

00:24.720 --> 00:25.720
Thank you, Senator.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.480
Keep all for this opportunity to be on your program.

00:28.480 --> 00:33.120
We've watched your record for years and the House of Representatives where TVA was being

00:33.120 --> 00:37.480
set up since you've been in the Senate, your crime investigations, your investigation

00:37.480 --> 00:42.640
of monopoly, the high price of steel, the high price of drugs, all of the many services

00:42.640 --> 00:44.400
you've rendered to American people.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.560
I know Ralph and I just want everybody to understand.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.960
I didn't put you up to this.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.960
I know the ground rules.

00:49.960 --> 00:54.040
You're not supposed to brag on the man when you own his program, but as this I'm breaking

00:54.040 --> 00:57.760
the rules because I think this is important and I just want to say it.

00:57.760 --> 01:04.280
I made a number of speeches for you in Texas in 1956 when you were running for Vice President

01:04.280 --> 01:06.600
on the Democratic Ticket and I'm proud of everyone.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.280
Well, you're certainly a dad and I appreciated you helping us too.

01:10.280 --> 01:14.000
Ralph, incidentally, a lot of your people come from Tennessee, don't they?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh, yes.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.400
My grandfather was born in Tennessee.

01:16.400 --> 01:21.040
My paternal grandfather, Yarbrough, and from the old age pension records, social security

01:21.040 --> 01:26.280
and others, all the records we have, we know that more people have come to Texas from Tennessee

01:26.280 --> 01:27.960
than from any other state in the Union.

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
That's right.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.960
That's right.

01:29.960 --> 01:33.580
Left there by Sam Houston, David Crockett, and many other Tennessee heroes who led the

01:33.580 --> 01:36.300
westward march of the American people into Texas.

01:36.300 --> 01:42.320
Well, there's always been a very close relationship between the State of Texas and the State of Tennessee.

01:42.320 --> 01:48.360
But friends, I've asked Senator Yarbrough here today to talk with him about federal,

01:48.360 --> 01:51.080
talk with you about federal aid for education.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.480
He was one of the ë¹¼s of the chief sponsors of the bill that we passed in the United States

01:55.480 --> 01:58.800
Senate, which is now pending in the House.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.280
I've just returned from Tennessee and I saw a lot of teachers, school people, and they

02:03.280 --> 02:05.880
are all interested in this subject.

02:05.880 --> 02:10.280
I thought Senator Yarbrough would be a mighty good senator who is very conversant with

02:10.280 --> 02:12.200
it to tell us about it.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.440
What tell us about the bill we got passed in the Senate, Ralph, and the need for it?

02:16.440 --> 02:22.240
Well, first of all, what is the situation today with reference to classrooms and teachers?

02:22.880 --> 02:29.080
Well, Estes, we have a shortage in the United States of about 135,000 trained school teachers

02:29.080 --> 02:32.720
and a shortage of about 140,000 classrooms.

02:32.720 --> 02:39.200
Now, that doesn't consider the million, 800,000 pupils who are in obsolete classrooms or

02:39.200 --> 02:42.960
crowded classrooms, too small, jammed up fire hazards.

02:42.960 --> 02:47.080
This is just classrooms where they're having to have two classes a day.

02:47.080 --> 02:51.640
Some students go to school half a day, some in the morning, some in the afternoon, which

02:51.640 --> 02:54.600
is a per system of education for the children.

02:54.600 --> 03:00.240
I believe the census will give us about 180 million people when it's completed.

03:00.240 --> 03:04.560
And I think it's estimated that 10 years and now we'll have better than 210 million

03:04.560 --> 03:06.560
people in the United States.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.560
Isn't that correct, Ralph?

03:07.560 --> 03:08.560
That's correct.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.960
In the cost of the classrooms, it's increasing.

03:10.960 --> 03:15.040
They tax burden for building these school buildings on the local homeowner and the local

03:15.040 --> 03:18.000
people has just about reached the limit.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.520
And to keep up this proper educational system, we've got to find new sources of tax revenue.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.440
Well, the future of our country depends upon the education of our youth, of course.

03:28.440 --> 03:33.160
Now, what does the bill provide in the way of granting aid to the states?

03:33.160 --> 03:38.160
They bill that passed in the Senate provides for a billion, nine hundred million dollars

03:38.160 --> 03:41.200
spent over two years with an optional provision.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.200
They share for the state.

03:42.200 --> 03:46.720
The Tennessee would be over twenty five million dollars a year.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.360
It is given to the state on an option.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.560
The state might spend it either for school buildings or for supplements to teach your pay

03:52.560 --> 03:54.760
or for any combination that the state wants.

03:54.760 --> 03:58.200
Well, we would get twenty five million a year in Tennessee.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.240
And it's also based upon the need of the state.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.640
And how much would Tennessee taxpayers have to contribute to that?

04:04.640 --> 04:06.240
About two and three quarter million.

04:06.240 --> 04:11.000
They don't need, in my state, for example, we would get sixty two million, the most of

04:11.000 --> 04:14.640
any state, but we have to contribute twelve million, some twenty percent.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.160
Based on need in Tennessee, they would contribute about twelve percent.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.160
And there are no federal strings attached.

04:20.160 --> 04:24.800
There's purely a grant in the age of the states to be spent either for supplementing teacher

04:24.800 --> 04:27.120
salaries or for construction of schools.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.120
Is that correct?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.120
Absolutely.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.120
Essentially keep over there.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.640
No federal strings on it.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.640
No federal control.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.120
Senator Lister Hill of Alabama is chairman of the Labor and Public Well Fire Committee.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.120
They've brought the bill out.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.160
Senator Hill has provisions written in there.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.360
All of us do to protect our state.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.840
Thank you very much, Senator Yarbren.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.360
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.
