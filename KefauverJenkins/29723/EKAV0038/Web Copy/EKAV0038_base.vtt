Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, as this broadcast is coming to you, the Senate

00:06.080 --> 00:11.200
Appropriations Committee of which I'm a member, is very busy considering a wide variety

00:11.200 --> 00:15.760
of projects which include many for Tennessee about six or seven subcommittees or meeting

00:15.760 --> 00:22.800
every day. The President's budget request included among other items the following, $153,000

00:22.800 --> 00:27.440
for paving a portion of the Gatlinberg spur of the foothills Parkway and a lot of money

00:27.440 --> 00:33.680
for construction of the Parkway. $1,900,000 for the completion of the Gatlinberg bypass

00:34.320 --> 00:40.480
and about $730,000 for grading and improving work on a natious trace Parkway

00:40.480 --> 00:45.440
and a little swan creek area. The budget also calls for the following flood control

00:45.440 --> 00:52.480
monies under the Mississippi River and tributaries. West Tennessee drainage district $400,000.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.240
Wolf River channeled the version and flood controlled in Shelby County $500,000 and the Memphis

00:58.240 --> 01:05.440
Harbor Project $640,000. Last year, with Congressman Everett taking the lead, we were successful for

01:05.440 --> 01:09.600
the first time in getting money to begin the work on the old iron and forkered deer rivers.

01:10.560 --> 01:16.320
This started channel clearance and straightening to let the flood waters out into the Mississippi

01:16.320 --> 01:22.320
River. Much farmland and many sections of highway in the Dyer's Berg area have suffered from

01:22.800 --> 01:28.320
these flood waters for many many years and pleased that the president has asked for another $400,000

01:28.320 --> 01:34.640
to continue this important flood control work and we will certainly push hard for it in the committee.

01:34.640 --> 01:40.000
The same is true of the Wolf River channeled the version work at Memphis. Cutting the new channel

01:40.000 --> 01:44.080
through the Mississippi, through to the Mississippi will do much toward removing the unpleasant

01:44.080 --> 01:50.640
odors in the north Memphis and downtown area. It will also remove many acres of bottom lands

01:50.720 --> 01:56.160
in Shelby County from repeated flooding during high water stages. I might also mention here that the

01:56.160 --> 02:02.960
budget included $17 million for work on the bark bed dam. While this is being built in Kentucky,

02:02.960 --> 02:07.760
the benefit will spread through many sections of our state at the northern portion where the

02:07.760 --> 02:14.880
impounded waters will back up and offer many miles of recreational shoreline and also transportation

02:14.880 --> 02:20.160
navigation. Now there's been no budget requests for additional mileage and the interstate highway

02:20.160 --> 02:26.080
program to build a road from Nashville to Dyer's Berg. Governor Ellington has stated that this

02:26.080 --> 02:31.280
is a much needed addition to the system and that he's working hard for it and we will certainly

02:31.280 --> 02:36.320
exert every effort here to see that it's included in the system. It would provide a much needed

02:36.320 --> 02:42.000
link between the northern northwestern portion of our state and the capital. It would also fill a

02:42.000 --> 02:47.040
yawning gap in our interstate system. The new section would be carried over the Mississippi river

02:47.040 --> 02:52.000
by a bridge to connect in Missouri where the rest of the presently planned interstate highway

02:52.000 --> 02:56.800
system. And while I'm on the subject of this interstate highway system, of course we want a good

02:56.800 --> 03:03.680
road from Memphis north to Chicago sometime. I've also learned from Bill Ferris, the Public Works

03:03.680 --> 03:09.680
Commissioner at Memphis, that the Bureau of Public Road is seeking to narrow the middle neutral

03:10.320 --> 03:17.920
strips in the Memphis and Shelby County marriage from 40 feet to 16 feet. I've already undertaken

03:17.920 --> 03:24.880
to put a stop to this. The 40 foot neutral strips are a sound investment. Future traffic loads will

03:24.880 --> 03:30.400
create the need for additional traffic lanes on these interstate sections. To have the 40 foot

03:30.400 --> 03:35.760
strips now means that the new space will not have to be acquired at higher cost when the time for

03:35.760 --> 03:41.200
expansion comes many years hence. There are many other items on the appropriation docket now

03:41.200 --> 03:48.000
before us. I wish I could cover all of them in this brief time but I cannot. I do want to mention

03:48.000 --> 03:55.360
the Cherokee National Forest, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and also the Fish Hatchery at Irvin

03:55.360 --> 04:01.120
Tennessee. The budget only asked for enough funds to maintain the present hatchery. I planned

04:01.120 --> 04:06.320
to offer an amendment which would provide for a complete overhaul of the Fish and Wildlife Service

04:06.320 --> 04:12.240
Hatchery at Irvin. The additional amount I will seek would also provide for a biological program

04:12.800 --> 04:18.000
for the Smoky Mountain National Park and that's it and Mr. Worst said he would go along with this.

04:18.560 --> 04:23.280
All of these programs whether they deal with keeping our national parks and forest and outdoor

04:23.280 --> 04:28.880
sports up to snuff or whether they continue meeting needs of flood control and roads and highways

04:29.120 --> 04:34.960
are very important not only to Tennessee and but to our nation and we will continue to see that

04:34.960 --> 04:44.800
they are properly provided for it. Thank you very much until next week.
