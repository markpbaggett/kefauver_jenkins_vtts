00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.300
During the many years that I served on the Armed Services Committee, we had Dr. Ralph

00:10.300 --> 00:16.760
Lapp before us, one of our great noted nuclear physicist, a man who had much to do with the

00:16.760 --> 00:22.560
development of the A-Bomb, who has written many books such as The Voice of the Lucky Dragon,

00:22.560 --> 00:27.600
New Discoveries, and I'm sure all of you are familiar with this imminent scientist.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.600
I've always wanted to have him on this program, and we have him today.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.100
Certainly I'd like to welcome you here, Dr. Lapp.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.600
Did I need to be here?

00:36.600 --> 00:43.440
Dr. Lapp has great knowledge, and as much as anyone I know about missiles, atomic energy,

00:43.440 --> 00:46.320
whether we are following the right programs or not.

00:46.320 --> 00:52.480
So Ralph, tell us how we are getting along in connection with atomic energy and hydrogen,

00:52.480 --> 00:56.920
hydrogen energy, vis-the-vis the Soviet Union.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.920
What's happening in this race today?

00:58.920 --> 01:06.320
Well, then the race, which is the race for destruction almost, it's difficult to say if one

01:06.320 --> 01:13.480
can ever really be ahead, but our present defense policy is based upon deterrence, upon preventing

01:13.480 --> 01:17.660
the enemy from attacking us by the power to retaliate.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.440
And in that connection there is a great argument on Capitol Hill as to whether or not the

01:21.440 --> 01:24.440
United States actually has sufficient power.

01:24.440 --> 01:29.200
In my mind, it is more a question of in the future, two to three years from now, will

01:29.200 --> 01:33.080
the United States military forces be strong enough to deter the Russians?

01:33.080 --> 01:36.240
And I think that there are some very real doubts about this.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.520
Well, I've been interested in whether we are making the right decision in connection with

01:40.520 --> 01:49.300
having fixed bases for ICBMs and Atlas missiles or whether the Polaris, whether they

01:49.300 --> 01:57.580
are a submarine, atomic submarine with the Polaris missile offers us more defense and a better

01:57.580 --> 02:00.780
opportunity of retaliation in the event we were attacked.

02:00.780 --> 02:06.580
Well, I think that anything that is fixed in geography, that is especially on this continent,

02:06.580 --> 02:08.940
is now vulnerable to attack.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.740
This wasn't originally the case because we didn't think these intercontinental ballistic

02:12.740 --> 02:14.660
missiles would be that accurate.

02:14.660 --> 02:19.020
Even if you harden the base nowadays and there are going to be 270 of these put in continental

02:19.020 --> 02:26.020
USA and even if you harden these, the Russian missiles will be sufficiently accurate in 1962

02:26.020 --> 02:30.340
and 1963 when these bases are operational so that they can knock them out.

02:30.340 --> 02:32.940
And that means your deterrent will not be believable.

02:32.940 --> 02:37.580
It will not survive an enemy attack, therefore he may be able to get away with whatever he

02:37.580 --> 02:38.580
wants to.

02:38.580 --> 02:44.500
And how about the atomic submarine with the Polaris missile which we're all very much interested

02:44.500 --> 02:45.500
in?

02:45.500 --> 02:50.340
It's a very superior type of deterrent for one reason that it is difficult for the enemy

02:50.340 --> 02:51.340
to knock it out.

02:51.340 --> 02:53.340
In other words, it is survivable.

02:53.340 --> 02:59.020
Secondly, from the standpoint of being off the continent, it doesn't draw nuclear fire

02:59.020 --> 03:00.020
to the United States.

03:00.020 --> 03:06.340
Oh, Dr. Leopold, how are we getting along in connection with our rockets and our contest

03:06.340 --> 03:11.820
and with the Soviet Union and rockets and what should we do to catch up and to get ahead?

03:11.820 --> 03:15.780
Well, that's a big forder for a very short answer, but I'll say this.

03:15.780 --> 03:18.980
We are behind the Russians in space.

03:18.980 --> 03:23.700
We are behind in a space race that we ourselves announced in 1955.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.060
We lack this thrust.

03:25.060 --> 03:30.940
We lack the power of our rockets to put into orbit into space the kind of things the Russians

03:30.940 --> 03:33.140
have been so successful in doing.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.540
We have not made up that gap.

03:35.540 --> 03:40.620
Furthermore, we have not been able to fuse together the military and the civilian aspects

03:40.620 --> 03:41.980
of the space race.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.740
That is a big deficiency.

03:43.740 --> 03:48.820
We lack the leadership in this field and we lack the sense of national urgency to give

03:48.820 --> 03:52.780
this kind of technical work the support that it needs.

03:52.780 --> 03:56.620
I take it from a military as well as a scientific point of view.

03:56.620 --> 04:04.060
This is very important that we have sufficient funds and we do have authority under one person

04:04.060 --> 04:07.780
who can make decisions and decide these inter-service disputes.

04:07.780 --> 04:12.460
I believe it is extremely important because I believe that Sputnik I was in the nature

04:12.460 --> 04:14.580
of a disaster for the United States.

04:14.580 --> 04:19.900
I do not believe we can sustain many of these disasters and still be knocked upon as the

04:19.900 --> 04:21.500
number one nation in the world.

04:21.500 --> 04:27.020
But we have the ability to catch up and to get ahead if we just put our mind to it and

04:27.020 --> 04:28.620
have the determination to do so.

04:28.620 --> 04:29.620
Is that your feeling?

04:29.620 --> 04:31.140
Of that I'm convinced.

04:31.140 --> 04:35.860
Well, thank you very much Dr. Ralph Lath and we hope to have you back again sometime.

04:35.860 --> 04:36.540
That's all for now.
