00:00.000 --> 00:16.620
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the most serious economic problem facing our

00:16.620 --> 00:22.360
nation today is the deadlock between labor and management in the steel industry. Negotiations,

00:22.360 --> 00:28.160
mediation and fact-finding swim around before the public's eye. In full-page advertisements

00:28.160 --> 00:33.320
placed by labor and management, each argues that the other is wrong. In the midst of this

00:33.320 --> 00:38.400
impasse, the public enters flounders and the consumer wonders. When the smoke is cleared

00:38.400 --> 00:44.120
away, well, John Cue public's pocketbook stagger under another blow. Whether price of paper

00:44.120 --> 00:50.180
clips and pots and pans and pumps and pyromores, and everything else John Cue must buy, clam

00:50.180 --> 00:56.420
another rum on the ladder of inflation when the sound and fury have subsided. Well, why

00:56.420 --> 01:01.460
are big steel and the steel workers locked in this gigantic wrestling match? Each with an

01:01.460 --> 01:06.820
identical hammer lock on the other. What are the conflicting positions of labor and management,

01:06.820 --> 01:11.820
which have produced this desperate drawout? Management rests this case essentially on the

01:11.820 --> 01:17.020
assumption that the time has come to halt what it calls inflationary wage increases.

01:17.020 --> 01:22.620
Management also says that it must have higher profits in order to finance the future expansion

01:22.620 --> 01:28.780
of the industry. Labor bases its case largely upon the assumption that the steel companies

01:28.780 --> 01:34.460
can easily afford to grant a wage boost without incurring an increase in cost, the cost of

01:34.460 --> 01:39.860
the increase in labor productivity. Labor also believes profits of the steel companies are

01:39.860 --> 01:45.180
excessive and wants to share in these profits. Labor and management both insist that they

01:45.180 --> 01:50.100
have the consumers interest at heart. Well, many facts have been produced from the series

01:50.100 --> 01:54.660
of administered price hearings before the antitrust and monopoly subcommittee of which

01:54.660 --> 02:00.660
I am chairman. This past week, one of the newest facts to reach the public came in the announcement

02:00.660 --> 02:06.420
by the steel companies themselves of their profits for the first half of this year. Profits

02:06.420 --> 02:12.660
after taxes for 14 companies accounting for three-fifths of the industry's capacity jumped

02:12.660 --> 02:18.580
145 percent over the first half of last year. The industry leader, United States Steel

02:18.580 --> 02:26.100
Corporation, with 28 percent of our steel making capacity, netted $255 million. This is

02:26.100 --> 02:31.780
88 percent more than the US steel netted for the same period last year. Well, friends,

02:31.780 --> 02:36.780
we are face to face today with a fundamental problem in the steel industry. In the future,

02:36.780 --> 02:42.900
this problem is going to confront us in other industries. Our public policy always has

02:42.900 --> 02:48.740
been toward industry in the past. It has been based on the theory of price competition.

02:48.740 --> 02:53.860
If any firm and a competitive industry makes an improvement which reduces its cost, it

02:53.860 --> 02:59.220
is assumed that it will reduce its prices accordingly. The other firms will have to make the

02:59.220 --> 03:04.580
improvement themselves or lose the business of the firm which made the improvement. The

03:04.580 --> 03:10.500
pioneering company gains increased business at least for a time while the consumer receives

03:10.500 --> 03:16.740
the benefit of the annulvation in the form of lower prices. But where there is no real price

03:16.740 --> 03:22.980
competition as in the steel industry, you just can't apply this theory. The problem we face today

03:22.980 --> 03:29.300
in non-competitive price industries is how to affect an equitable distribution of productivity gains

03:29.940 --> 03:35.780
made possible by scientific progress. Labor claims these gains. It argues that labor is being

03:35.780 --> 03:42.660
displaced by technological progress. Management bases its claims on the need for installation

03:42.660 --> 03:47.940
of new and better machinery and equipment. It argues that greater profits are required for this.

03:48.660 --> 03:54.580
But the consumer has a claim too. John Cue Public argues that there is no purpose to scientific

03:54.580 --> 04:01.220
progress unless it results ultimately in lower prices or better products. While translating this

04:01.220 --> 04:06.980
into the context of the present steel controversy, I believe the consumer should continue to be the

04:06.980 --> 04:13.860
principle beneficiary of technological progress. I believe there is ample room without undue reduction

04:13.860 --> 04:20.820
in profits for price reduction in steel, together with a small increase in wages, preferably in the

04:20.820 --> 04:26.820
form of an increase in pensions, which would give greater time to enjoy life to the older workers

04:26.820 --> 04:31.620
and greater opportunity to the younger ones. Until this problem is faced with the nation and

04:31.620 --> 04:37.060
by all divisions of our government, I am afraid the wage-price spiral will keep spending higher and

04:37.060 --> 04:42.820
higher and the value of John Cue Public's dollar will plunge lower and lower. But I hope this is not

04:42.820 --> 04:48.020
going to be the case. Thank you until next week at this time.
