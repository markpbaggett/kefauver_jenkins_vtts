00:00.000 --> 00:18.620
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I know that you've all been following very closely

00:18.620 --> 00:23.660
the presidents of White House Conference on Children and Youth, which is being held here

00:23.660 --> 00:26.000
in Washington this week.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.580
Today in the studio, we have some of the distinguished delegates from Tennessee to

00:29.580 --> 00:34.700
this most important conference for the youth of our nation, and I will introduce

00:34.700 --> 00:38.180
people who are here from my right to the left.

00:38.180 --> 00:47.220
Dr. Roy Baker, who is the Commissioner of Mental Health and the State of Tennessee, is

00:47.220 --> 00:50.820
with us, and very important in this conference.

00:50.820 --> 00:54.940
Next on my right is not a delegate to the conference, she has been following very closely

00:54.940 --> 00:58.540
in the newspaper on television and the radio of my life, Nancy.

00:58.540 --> 01:00.820
What do you think about the conference, Nancy?

01:00.820 --> 01:03.380
Well, I'm tremendously interested.

01:03.380 --> 01:07.020
I'm convinced from all I've heard that the mother's place is in the home.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.780
Keep the children busy.

01:08.780 --> 01:13.380
Find something for you can take a little bit of experience with four of them.

01:13.380 --> 01:14.580
Great experience.

01:14.580 --> 01:21.420
And on my left is Professor Popdhar of Central High School at Chattanooga, who has been

01:21.420 --> 01:24.340
a student of these problems for a long, long time.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.940
It's good to have you with us, Popdhar.

01:26.940 --> 01:30.620
And Dr. Raymond Ballister of Nashville, who is one of the managers of the Tennessee

01:30.620 --> 01:32.340
Parent Teachers Association.

01:32.340 --> 01:37.860
As both of us start with you, Popdhar, tell us what this conference is all about.

01:37.860 --> 01:42.980
And Sam, there are 7,000 people here, some children.

01:42.980 --> 01:50.740
Some of them are approximately 7,000 delegates from the different states and 500 from foreign

01:50.740 --> 01:53.020
countries.

01:53.020 --> 02:03.140
Each day there are five assemblies, theme assemblies, hell, 18 forums, and 210 workshops daily.

02:03.140 --> 02:06.420
Each person participates in each one of them.

02:06.420 --> 02:10.820
I understand Dr. Ballister, you have your large meetings in the morning and then the

02:10.820 --> 02:13.220
division meetings in the afternoon.

02:13.220 --> 02:17.660
It represents two or three hundred conferences going on at the same time as what it amounts

02:17.660 --> 02:24.500
to that several small groups get together and discuss specific topics after having received

02:24.500 --> 02:28.460
some stimulation and background information from the general session.

02:28.460 --> 02:34.340
Now we had a great conference like this in 1950 and this is the one following that conference

02:34.340 --> 02:35.340
of 1960.

02:35.340 --> 02:40.140
Dr. Baker, the president addressed the first meeting of the conference, didn't he?

02:40.140 --> 02:41.140
Yes, he did.

02:41.140 --> 02:44.620
I tell us a lot of your question of his speech.

02:44.620 --> 02:48.180
Very inspiring talk, I think.

02:48.180 --> 02:53.260
This was very well attended, of course, being the first session on Sunday night.

02:53.260 --> 02:57.740
And I think that the president's talk set the tone for the whole conference, really.

02:57.740 --> 02:58.740
Yes, it was.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.220
It was a splendid address that he made.

03:01.220 --> 03:04.620
And Mr. Dyer, how many are here from Tennessee?

03:04.620 --> 03:10.220
I think I've never seen a better cross section of more splendid people.

03:10.220 --> 03:15.460
Senator, I believe we have approximately one hundred delegates from the state of Tennessee.

03:15.460 --> 03:23.020
I believe 64 have been appointed by the governor directly and I believe about 35 to 40 have

03:23.020 --> 03:26.540
been appointed by the various organizations throughout the nation.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.100
And a very large proportion of being young people.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.700
Yes, that's important.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.300
That's important so they can talk about their problems themselves.

03:33.300 --> 03:39.660
Well, let me ask, now we are not just talking about opportunities for youth generally and

03:39.660 --> 03:45.260
not just talking about what can be done relative to the three or three and a half percent, get

03:45.260 --> 03:47.180
to be juvenile to Lindwoods.

03:47.180 --> 03:53.300
But we are living in a new world, aren't we, a fast moving world in which all values and

03:53.300 --> 03:57.020
which methods of yesterday might not exactly fit today.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.420
Is that right, Dr. Baker?

03:58.420 --> 04:00.420
That's certainly correct.

04:00.420 --> 04:07.020
Ideas are just moving at such a terrific pace that it's hard for youth to know which

04:07.020 --> 04:08.740
values to embrace.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.340
And which values adults should pass on?

04:11.340 --> 04:12.780
Adults don't know either.

04:12.780 --> 04:18.500
Well Nancy, what do you think about in the summertime about keeping kids busy?

04:18.500 --> 04:19.500
That's...

04:19.500 --> 04:21.940
Oh, I think it's terribly important.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.460
How do you do it?

04:23.460 --> 04:25.380
Well, they have cats.

04:25.380 --> 04:30.660
I think cats are tremendously helpful and they develop so much interest.

04:30.660 --> 04:34.980
We found a very good thing when David has wanted to get some money that we let him collect

04:34.980 --> 04:39.100
all the newspapers and take him down to the junk dealer and sell them and that certainly

04:39.100 --> 04:40.380
keeps him very, very busy.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.460
Well, there are so many things that we could talk about, but I know out of this great conference

04:44.460 --> 04:49.660
will come much good work, recommendations for legislation, increased interest back home

04:49.660 --> 04:55.260
and much good for our nation will be the result of this White House conference on you.

04:55.260 --> 04:58.660
Thank you very much, Nancy and gentlemen, for being with me.

04:58.660 --> 04:59.660
That's all for now.

04:59.660 --> 05:00.180
Good bye, until next week.
