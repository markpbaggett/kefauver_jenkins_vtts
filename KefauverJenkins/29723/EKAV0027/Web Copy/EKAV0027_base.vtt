00:00.000 --> 00:08.100
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I want to talk to you with you today about

00:08.100 --> 00:12.820
a subject which has been occupying all of our time lately and which is a great interest

00:12.820 --> 00:13.980
to all citizens.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.940
Our referal course to the Civil Rights Philobustry.

00:17.940 --> 00:22.380
The Senate has been debating the subject since February 15th when Senator Lyndon Johnson

00:22.380 --> 00:27.540
of Texas moved to bring up a bill which would permit the people of the little town of Stullam

00:27.540 --> 00:32.280
Zura to use a building at Camp Crowder as a schoolhouse.

00:32.280 --> 00:36.280
Senator Dirkson, the minority leader, then moved to substitute the administration's

00:36.280 --> 00:40.500
Civil Rights Bill for the Stullam Zura Bill.

00:40.500 --> 00:45.600
This in my opinion is a very poor way to legislate, but obviously Senator Johnson felt he had

00:45.600 --> 00:50.900
to make this move because at the last session of Congress, when there were demands for immediate

00:50.900 --> 00:56.580
action on Civil Rights which would have delayed the adjournment of Congress, he gave his assurance

00:56.580 --> 01:00.820
and his worth that a bill would be considered by the middle of February.

01:00.820 --> 01:04.740
Personally, I would much have referred to a late house action on this matter before

01:04.740 --> 01:09.900
beginning Senate debate and I so stated this on the floor of the Senate.

01:09.900 --> 01:14.620
This week the first move occurred to apply a flat floture to the Senate debate, that

01:14.620 --> 01:18.780
is to cut it off after some other limited debate.

01:18.780 --> 01:24.180
A floture petition signed by 31 senators as filed and came to vote on Thursday.

01:24.180 --> 01:29.060
I voted against it because I think flotures should be used only in very rare conditions.

01:29.060 --> 01:32.500
And I do not think this matter has been sufficiently debated.

01:32.500 --> 01:38.220
There has been more confusion than light shed on the issue thus far in my opinion.

01:38.220 --> 01:43.500
Furthermore, here I would oppose floture because we have not yet reached a point where

01:43.500 --> 01:49.420
we can clearly see just what kind of final bill will come before us.

01:49.420 --> 01:53.180
This week the house began to debate on its own Civil Rights Bill.

01:53.180 --> 01:58.140
Here Sam Raybrin, the leader expects the house to finish by Wednesday of next week.

01:58.140 --> 02:02.740
The house bill is much more moderate than the Durkson administration bill and has been

02:02.740 --> 02:08.260
my opinion all along that the Senate will not act until the house measure was before it.

02:08.260 --> 02:12.820
I have had letters from some of my friends in Tennessee asking why I have not joined in

02:12.820 --> 02:14.740
the President of the Fillebustry.

02:14.740 --> 02:19.660
The answer which I have given to them and which I will give to you is of two parts.

02:19.660 --> 02:24.540
As the Fillebustry is designed not to be a full debate which I favor on all issues,

02:24.540 --> 02:29.500
but rather to prevent the Senate from ever reaching a vote on particular legislation.

02:29.500 --> 02:34.140
I think that democracy will not long survive unless eventually a legislative body is able

02:34.140 --> 02:35.140
to act.

02:35.140 --> 02:40.180
Otherwise, the whole legislative process may break down and we will not even be able to

02:40.180 --> 02:44.820
deal with emergency situations affecting the safety of the nation.

02:44.820 --> 02:51.260
From second, I favor three proposals contained in the Senate bill and expect a vote for them.

02:51.260 --> 02:55.940
These are the proposals to help all qualified voters regardless of race or color, secure

02:55.940 --> 02:56.940
the right to vote.

02:56.940 --> 03:02.580
The so-called anti-bomb legislation designed to punish persons who would bomb property,

03:02.580 --> 03:05.300
especially schools and churches.

03:05.300 --> 03:10.420
And the proposal to authorize the federal government to provide schools for service personnel

03:10.420 --> 03:15.340
children stationed in states where the local schools might be closed.

03:15.340 --> 03:19.980
I think the vast majority of Tennesseans are for these proposals and would not want me

03:19.980 --> 03:22.380
to fill the buster against them.

03:22.380 --> 03:25.660
They are basically right and therefore should be enacted into law.

03:25.660 --> 03:32.700
Well, there are many other amendments about five pounds of them up on the floor for consideration.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.220
And I shall vote against many of these.

03:35.220 --> 03:40.380
I think that I'm in a stronger position than some of those who oppose all measures because

03:40.380 --> 03:42.620
I have tried to show that I am reasonable.

03:42.620 --> 03:48.660
I have not filled the buster and I have voted for the extension of the Civil Rights Commission.

03:48.660 --> 03:53.980
On the ground if they should be studied much more, I can now urge against hasty action

03:53.980 --> 03:57.260
because they have not been adequately studied.

03:57.260 --> 04:01.540
It was because I had tried to show that I was reasonable, that I was able to draft and

04:01.540 --> 04:08.580
have accepted the amendment to the 1957 Act, which separated civil from criminal contempt.

04:08.580 --> 04:13.220
I made it possible to give jury trials and criminal contempt cases.

04:13.220 --> 04:17.780
That I think is the kind of representation the vast majority of Tennesseans want from

04:17.780 --> 04:18.780
their senators.

04:18.780 --> 04:24.060
I believe that in the final analysis a moderate bill which we can all live with and which

04:24.060 --> 04:28.060
would be beneficial to both Tennessean and the nation will be the result.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.780
And I shall certainly to vote my efforts toward that end.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.340
Thank you and goodbye until next week.
