00:00.000 --> 00:12.080
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I think all of us realize that the strength

00:12.080 --> 00:19.400
of the Western nations of Europe and of the United States and Canada offer the greatest

00:19.400 --> 00:25.920
hope and assurance for peace if we can stand together and work together, one for all and

00:25.920 --> 00:34.620
all for one, militarily, economically and politically. So that in 1949 the North Atlantic

00:34.620 --> 00:41.400
Treaty organization was created and up to this time we have gotten along, although we've

00:41.400 --> 00:48.520
had many differences between the 15 nations comprising what we call NATO. Many of us have

00:48.520 --> 00:57.220
been interested for a long, long time in having a citizens' commission to work as with other

00:57.220 --> 01:03.980
commissions of other NATO nations, a limited number to meet and to continue to discuss ways

01:03.980 --> 01:10.680
and means of improving the techniques and the operations and the unity of our North Atlantic

01:10.680 --> 01:16.980
Treaty organization. And last fall this resolution was passed by the Congress of the United

01:16.980 --> 01:23.640
States after an effort. Then in March of this year the United States Commission was created

01:23.640 --> 01:31.460
consisting of 20 members. Today we're very honored in having with us the co-chairman of the United

01:31.460 --> 01:37.220
States Citizens Commission on NATO. There are men that you will know well and it's a great

01:37.220 --> 01:44.940
privilege and pleasure to have with us and the studio, Mr. Will Clayton of Tennessee and Texas,

01:44.940 --> 01:52.620
a former great undersecretary of state and one of the fine and great men of our nation.

01:52.620 --> 01:58.980
Mr. Will, it's good to have you with us today. I certainly appreciate it. And then I'll

01:58.980 --> 02:06.140
miss to Clayton's right is Mr. Christian Herder, a very able well-known governor, former governor

02:06.140 --> 02:12.860
of Massachusetts. And the secretary of state served with great distinction and married and

02:12.860 --> 02:22.060
honor until we Democrats took over here recently. Mr. Will, first, we intend to see you've

02:22.060 --> 02:27.740
always been tremendously fond of you because you grew up, I believe, at Jackson, Tennessee.

02:27.740 --> 02:38.780
Thank you, Assistant. Yes, I did. I was re-adding Jackson. Left when I was 15 years old when I

02:38.780 --> 02:46.700
have a very warm spot in my heart for Tennessee. Yes, sir. And then after you became the head of

02:46.700 --> 02:53.900
Anderson Clayton Company, one of the greatest cut-in company in the world, and you were here as

02:53.900 --> 02:59.820
in government. You found a place called Look Out Mountain and you built a home there and lived

02:59.820 --> 03:06.700
there for a number of years, didn't you? Yes. We had a summer home there and lived there for

03:07.660 --> 03:13.660
20 summers, I think. Well, I can certify because it's a wonderful place to spend the summer.

03:14.540 --> 03:19.340
We have a between the bank and the insurance company and I see and I have a summer house up

03:19.340 --> 03:29.900
there ourselves. Well, Mr. Herder, tell us about the work of the United States Citizens Commission

03:29.900 --> 03:38.060
and what is the trouble with NATO at the present time? What are we aiming at? Well, you asked for

03:38.060 --> 03:43.820
a pretty wide field. Well, you asked I can add a little part. That's easy. Commissioners, you know,

03:43.820 --> 03:52.300
only got organized shortly after its appointment and in recent weeks, various members of the commission,

03:52.300 --> 03:58.540
including Will Clayton myself, have been traveling to different countries in order to simulate

03:58.620 --> 04:03.740
the creation of similar committees in the NATO countries so that in time we could organize a

04:03.740 --> 04:09.580
type of convention that was envisaged in the resolution. I think that that is progressing,

04:09.580 --> 04:16.460
but it's a slow process because in the good many cases it's not entirely clear just how the

04:16.460 --> 04:21.900
committee should be set up and we have set it rather unusual precedent so others can't necessarily

04:21.900 --> 04:25.900
with some of their parliamentary restrictions follow and exact the same detail.

04:26.860 --> 04:33.660
The interfather work of the commissioners concerned I agree entirely with the very first words that you said

04:35.580 --> 04:41.420
that perhaps the most important thing today, the first priority from the fund review of the free world

04:42.300 --> 04:47.100
is to make certain of the free nations of the world as represented in large measure by the

04:47.100 --> 04:53.820
Atlantic community should be operating from a military political and economic fund review

04:54.700 --> 05:01.740
in as close unit as it's possible to get. I have been difficult as you know. I think there's so

05:01.740 --> 05:07.020
well known that I'd rather not go into the detail of the difficulty but I think that among the

05:07.020 --> 05:11.580
free nations this is a characteristic of free peoples that they do have differences. That's what makes

05:11.580 --> 05:17.580
this strong I guess. It doesn't need, but I think that the responsibility that Will Clayton and the

05:17.580 --> 05:25.180
members of our commission have is to examine those difficulties and to explore as the resolution says

05:25.180 --> 05:34.060
ways in which this group of the free world can strengthen the democratic free world in the

05:34.060 --> 05:38.220
various aspects that have been laid out particularly in the economic and the political field.

05:39.020 --> 05:47.820
Well Mr. Will we usually think of NATO as a military alliance and I know that you have

05:49.340 --> 05:58.380
another idea about an important part of NATO tell us about the other parts, the political and

05:58.380 --> 06:06.140
the economy. Well I'm particularly interested in Article 2 of the NATO agreement which

06:07.100 --> 06:17.660
provides that the members of NATO which are now 15 countries shall cooperate together

06:18.460 --> 06:33.020
from the point of view of strengthening the economic ties and cooperate in an economic sense as

06:33.020 --> 06:44.220
well as a military sense and that Article 2 has not been put into operation to the extent that

06:44.220 --> 06:51.900
I think it should be and we're hoping that we may be able to make some suggestions as a result of

06:53.500 --> 06:59.900
deliberations of this United States Citizens Commission on NATO that will contribute to that end.

07:00.700 --> 07:05.500
Well Kristen Hurrist said that you and he had been together to a number of nations where have

07:05.500 --> 07:13.100
you been Mr. Will? We visited London and then bond and then Rome and then Paris,

07:13.900 --> 07:19.500
of poor nations and Mr. Hurrist has been to Canada. And did you find what kind of reaction did you

07:19.500 --> 07:29.020
find among the people and the nations that you went to? We found a warm reception in all of those

07:29.020 --> 07:41.820
countries and a desire to cooperate with us in every possible way. Of course this commission,

07:42.540 --> 07:49.740
setting up of this commission is rather a new thing in our country and it certainly is new in

07:49.740 --> 07:55.900
that country that there should be a Citizens Commission that would report to the government but

07:55.900 --> 08:05.340
would have no right to commit to government in any way. Well it is I think the commission we have is

08:06.620 --> 08:14.140
probably one of a very few of its type but I've had the feeling that with a wise man,

08:14.140 --> 08:19.980
dedicated man like yourselves and I want to say that I've never known a commission that had

08:19.980 --> 08:27.660
Abler, may I know why you do have one fine woman on the commission too. We receive no compensation

08:27.660 --> 08:33.900
who has a matter of good for the world and for the country are giving them their time, thought

08:33.900 --> 08:42.860
and brains and influence in this great effort. Kristen, Mr. Platon said you had been up to Canada.

08:43.820 --> 08:50.780
How much was your reaction there? What did the Canadians do about it? Well the Canadian,

08:50.780 --> 08:58.460
I saw members of the government as well as the various members of the parliamentary bodies who

08:58.460 --> 09:04.140
were principally concerned many of them, the NATO parliamentarians and they're going to work out

09:04.140 --> 09:12.140
a method of representation to set up a commission. They're very much interested as you know in Canada

09:12.220 --> 09:17.900
at the moment there is a good deal of discussion going on because of the

09:18.700 --> 09:23.260
influence at least in some of Mr. McMillan's statements that the British are going to join the

09:23.260 --> 09:30.780
common market and Canada naturally wondering as one of the commonwealth countries what is going to

09:30.780 --> 09:36.140
become of the her special privileges as a commonwealth country in the British market so that

09:36.140 --> 09:43.260
it's a pretty hot subject but I think that the Canadians all of those that I spoke to feel that

09:43.260 --> 09:48.780
the exploration and question commissions of this kind might make the other might be very helpful

09:48.780 --> 09:56.220
and very useful. Well, Kristen, how about Mr. Diffinbacker, the Prime Minister of Canada? He's

09:56.220 --> 10:00.860
been very much interested in hasn't he? Yes, he's been very much interested but he is very much

10:00.860 --> 10:05.980
concerned about this move for the British at the moment and he has asked for a meeting of the

10:05.980 --> 10:10.220
Prime Minister of all the commonwealth countries to discuss it. I don't know whether that will come

10:10.220 --> 10:15.980
about or not because I noticed that the British are sending very high ranking ministers to those

10:15.980 --> 10:21.020
countries now, to Australia and New Zealand and Canada to discuss the relation of the commonwealth.

10:21.020 --> 10:25.340
They're also sending another high commission of some of their Asiatic members of the commonwealth.

10:25.420 --> 10:31.740
What did the NATO parliamentarians in Canada have a meeting and take action while you were there?

10:31.740 --> 10:35.980
Yes, they did. They discussed the thing from beginning to end. We've been over now.

10:35.980 --> 10:41.820
They're discussing various phases of it and then they asked the resolution favouring it.

10:41.820 --> 10:49.660
I believe that Greece, one of our NATO nations has already set up a council or a commission similar

10:49.660 --> 10:57.420
to ours. How would they Mr. Will? Yes, and it's called a Hellenic Citizens Commission on NATO.

10:58.540 --> 11:03.340
I've always been impressed with the fact that if a military alliance is going to survive,

11:03.340 --> 11:08.700
if we're going to have unity and strength, that we had to have some better means of

11:09.340 --> 11:15.740
political consultation, not that we follow on another's political policy in every case,

11:15.740 --> 11:21.660
but we all at least each know what the others doing. Like in the case, you were Secretary of State,

11:21.660 --> 11:28.140
I believe, or were you Mr. Herder when the Suez of Fair came? No, I was under Secretary at that time.

11:28.140 --> 11:33.020
You were under Secretary of State. And the French and British took move and

11:33.740 --> 11:39.180
Hernerlet had not been discussed with the United States, although it involved the whole world.

11:39.180 --> 11:44.700
Is that part of the things that you will be talking about when you meet with these representatives

11:44.700 --> 11:51.100
of other countries? Well, one of the problems in NATO that has always arisen has been so-called

11:51.100 --> 11:57.580
political consultation. That is the effort to try to get a common meeting ground and a common policy.

11:59.420 --> 12:07.100
It improved very, very considerably, but it is never going to be completely satisfactory

12:08.460 --> 12:13.980
in my way of thinking. Until our political ties are stronger than they are at the present time.

12:14.700 --> 12:18.220
That will be part of the things that you will try to bring about, Mr. Tudor.

12:18.220 --> 12:24.940
That's right. How do you view the General Western or Atlantic picture at the present time, Mr. Will?

12:26.220 --> 12:35.980
I think that it illustrates very strongly the need for some means of bringing the

12:36.700 --> 12:46.940
West to the NATO countries and the OECD countries closer together. If we are to successfully defend

12:46.940 --> 12:55.660
ourselves in America against the monolithic power of the Soviet Union plus the Chinese,

12:56.860 --> 13:01.500
they have a billion people now which is one out of every three in the world.

13:02.300 --> 13:08.460
And if it ever should get to be two out of three, I think the world has lost its freedom.

13:09.980 --> 13:16.540
Well, I just want to say on my own, ladies and gentlemen, that I think there are great hope for

13:16.540 --> 13:23.740
pieces in the Atlantic community and free people standing together. I think that Mr. Clayton and

13:24.300 --> 13:30.780
Mr. Hurder and the others on this commission are rendering a great public service and trying to

13:31.100 --> 13:37.100
bring about ways and means so that we can stand together well. Better. We are indebted to them.

13:37.740 --> 13:41.180
It may make the difference between peace and war and the days to come.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.860
So Mr. Will Clayton, I want to thank you very much for being with us.

13:44.860 --> 13:45.900
Thank you, Mr. President.

13:45.900 --> 13:50.620
Mr. Hurder, it's all for nice to be here coming. Be with us and we all appreciate it.

13:50.620 --> 13:57.100
That's all for now. Thank you very much.
