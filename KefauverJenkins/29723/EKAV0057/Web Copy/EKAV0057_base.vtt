00:00.000 --> 00:19.360
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, there's good news from Washington today and

00:19.360 --> 00:21.920
also a little of the other variety.

00:21.920 --> 00:26.560
On the bright side, the Tennessee Valley Authority won the right to self-finance some long-needed

00:26.560 --> 00:29.000
new generating facilities.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.880
The victory came after a lengthy legislative battle between friends of TVA and its private

00:33.880 --> 00:34.880
power enemies.

00:34.880 --> 00:40.120
The self-financing bill, as you know, was approved last month by both the House and the Senate.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.960
It then was sent to President Eisenhower for his approval or veto.

00:44.960 --> 00:49.520
Many persons predicted the President would veto the bill, but the President finally agreed

00:49.520 --> 00:55.040
to sign the measure on the assurance of congressional leaders that a clarifying amendment on executive

00:55.040 --> 00:57.160
authority would be passed.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.440
It was a great day for the Valley when the bill was signed into a law, and I might add

01:01.440 --> 01:06.120
a great day for all members of Congress from Tennessee and other states who have worked

01:06.120 --> 01:09.000
so diligently for its passage.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.600
Under the new statute, the TVA board has a media authority to issue up to $750 million worth

01:14.600 --> 01:18.360
of revenue bonds for expansion purposes.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.240
Why is that so important?

01:20.240 --> 01:22.600
Let me take a moment to explain.

01:22.600 --> 01:27.400
The most serious steep with tragic examples of national decline because of soil, forest,

01:27.400 --> 01:29.320
or water misuse.

01:29.320 --> 01:34.480
The Great Tennessee Valley might have become another tragic example, if the TVA had not

01:34.480 --> 01:38.000
been created in 1953.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.640
Prior to the TVA, the Great Rivers of the Valley were languid in one season, but wild and destructive

01:43.640 --> 01:45.000
in another.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.720
In those days, the soils of the Valley were severely depleted.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.640
The average income of our people was only 44% of the national average.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.160
A smattering of industry was just about all we've had.

01:57.160 --> 02:01.880
Prior to the TVA, only 3% of our rural homes were electrified.

02:01.880 --> 02:07.680
Indeed, the Valley of 25 years ago presented a fairly typical picture of an economically

02:07.680 --> 02:09.480
underdeveloped area.

02:09.480 --> 02:12.800
I need not explain to you the benefits of TVA.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.000
Our farms are now electrified up to 97%.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.040
Farm living knives is modern as urban living.

02:19.040 --> 02:24.080
Farm incomes have increased through the use of our TVA electrical service.

02:24.080 --> 02:28.840
Our industrial program in Tennessee has moved briskly ahead because we have ample low-cost

02:28.840 --> 02:29.840
power.

02:29.840 --> 02:34.320
At the same time, the TVA has opened up great recreational areas.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.640
Our state has become a major tourist attraction.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.920
Nevertheless, officials of the TVA for the past several years are warned of a possible

02:41.920 --> 02:48.240
power shortage, as more and more electricity to it was demanded by our whole man for industry.

02:48.240 --> 02:52.360
They pointed out that more generating facilities would be required soon.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.120
Our progress in the Valley would be severely restricted.

02:56.120 --> 02:59.080
Electricity cannot be stockpiled like most products.

02:59.080 --> 03:03.680
That is, you can't stack cans of electricity in a warehouse like bales of cotton or sacks

03:03.680 --> 03:05.560
of sugar.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.400
Electricity has to flow from distribution areas immediately to the farm or the home or

03:09.400 --> 03:11.000
the industry.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.520
But obviously there must be an ample generating capacity or someone somewhere along the electric

03:15.520 --> 03:18.440
line will not get what he wants.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.920
More than that, it takes about three years to build a new generating steam plant.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.400
So TVA asks the Congress for authority to borrow money.

03:26.400 --> 03:31.200
This money, accidentally, will be repaid by the TVA with interest, just the same as if

03:31.200 --> 03:35.000
a businessman goes down the street and borrowed money from his local bank.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.880
In other words, the government is not at one cent.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.800
Neither is the taxpayer.

03:39.800 --> 03:45.480
The funds will be repaid by TVA from revenues collected from the sale of electricity.

03:45.480 --> 03:51.080
Immediately after TVA asked Congress for authority to borrow money, enemies of the TVA tried to

03:51.080 --> 03:53.240
slam the door in its face.

03:53.240 --> 03:58.400
They were successful in delaying the passage of the self-financing bill last year when

03:58.400 --> 04:01.480
it passed the site, but it was pigeonholed in the house.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.880
But finally we made it.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.800
And TVA cannot take steps to expand its power generating facilities for the betterment

04:07.800 --> 04:11.880
of both home, farm and industry.

04:11.880 --> 04:16.120
Well friends on the dim side, I must report that necessary monies for the proposed Melton

04:16.120 --> 04:21.360
Hill and Carthage Dams will have to await the next session of Congress.

04:21.360 --> 04:27.400
These projects are number one on my list of must appropriations in the 1960s session.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.520
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I was instrumental in pushing through a

04:32.520 --> 04:38.560
$1,250,000 appropriation for preliminary work on these two dams.

04:38.560 --> 04:43.640
This appropriation was backed off, however, when in conference for the House of Representatives.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.640
We did our best.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.440
It's my hope and indeed my conviction that next year we'll mark the start of these

04:48.440 --> 04:49.440
projects.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.440
You may be assured of my continued effort.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.800
Thank you very much until next week.
