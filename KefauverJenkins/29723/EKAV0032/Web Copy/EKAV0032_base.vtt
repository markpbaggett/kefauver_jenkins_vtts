Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, it's a pleasure for me to report on a substantial

00:10.280 --> 00:15.520
number of new public works projects for East, Middle and West Tennessee.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.200
These projects were recommended by the President and his annual budget requests for the new fiscal

00:20.200 --> 00:22.880
year beginning next July.

00:22.880 --> 00:27.960
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, we will have an opportunity to pass on the money,

00:27.960 --> 00:32.640
which will be required to bring these projects about, and of course money has to be appropriated

00:32.640 --> 00:35.240
for them to become a reality.

00:35.240 --> 00:39.880
Well last year, a tragic situation developed for one of our Tennessee veterans.

00:39.880 --> 00:45.160
This disabled veteran was so sick he was unable to travel from Memphis to Nashville or his

00:45.160 --> 00:49.760
annual check-up as is required by the Veterans Administration.

00:49.760 --> 00:54.000
As a result, his monthly pension allotment was threatened to be cut off.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.040
An investigation showed that all West Tennessee disabled veterans was traveled to Nashville

00:59.040 --> 01:04.320
because facilities are lacking at the Kennedy General Hospital at Memphis.

01:04.320 --> 01:10.300
I talked with Veterans Administration Sumner-Hoodier last autumn and was assured by him that funds

01:10.300 --> 01:16.520
would be sought by the Veterans Administration for the construction of an outpatient clinic

01:16.520 --> 01:17.520
at Kennedy General.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.080
And I'm happy to report that this promise has been kept.

01:21.080 --> 01:26.080
The President and his budget request asked for $137,000.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.320
Be satisfied for construction of such a clinic.

01:29.320 --> 01:34.440
I know many hundreds of disabled veterans who live in West Tennessee will welcome this news.

01:34.440 --> 01:39.560
The same is all citizens who honor those who fought in defense of their country.

01:39.560 --> 01:44.280
The tourist industry, as we all know, has become a multi-million dollar annual business in

01:44.280 --> 01:45.800
Tennessee.

01:45.800 --> 01:51.160
Each year, the number of tourists increases, thus providing employment for many of our people

01:51.160 --> 01:54.960
and spreading the fame of our state to all corners of the world.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.880
But like all businesses, the customer must be satisfied.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.400
The President has asked Congress to appropriate more than $6 million for improvement in the

02:03.400 --> 02:07.680
Great Smoky Mountain National Park and the foothills Parkway.

02:07.680 --> 02:14.760
The largest item was $1,900,000 for completion of the long-needed 4 1-3 mile Gatlinburg

02:14.760 --> 02:16.760
bypass.

02:16.760 --> 02:21.240
Construction of the Meldon Hill Dam on the clinch revereneer Clinton and Oak Ridge will

02:21.240 --> 02:24.720
begin this year as a result of another request.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.720
The project has been sought as a means of creating new generating capacity in our Great Tennessee

02:29.720 --> 02:36.040
Valley, adding to flood control and navigation up to Clinton and Great Recurational Value.

02:36.040 --> 02:42.440
The President recommended an initial $4,000,000,000 for initial construction work.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.880
Hundreds of new jobs will us be made available in that area.

02:45.880 --> 02:52.120
When completed, more good TVA power for industrial expansion and other purposes will be provided.

02:52.120 --> 02:57.020
In the West Tennessee area, more than $17 million has been requested for construction of

02:57.020 --> 02:58.920
Parkway Dam.

02:58.920 --> 03:04.800
Although located in Kentucky, impounded waters of Parkway Dam will back up into Tennessee

03:04.800 --> 03:12.240
and provide miles of recreational shoreline and flood control and navigation.

03:12.240 --> 03:17.080
And also will offer employment to many Tennesseeans who live in that vicinity.

03:17.080 --> 03:22.200
The Corps of Engineers has also asked for more than $2 million for operation and maintenance

03:22.200 --> 03:26.360
along the Cumberland River and its tributaries in middle Tennessee.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.640
Another approximately $1 million is sought for the operation of locks and maintenance of

03:30.640 --> 03:33.320
dams along the Tennessee River.

03:33.320 --> 03:38.880
These requests showed in our trust will receive approval by Congress.

03:38.880 --> 03:46.400
The President's request included $13,600,000 for construction start of Memphis's new federal

03:46.400 --> 03:54.960
building and $133,000 for site and planning of a federal building at Dazbury.

03:54.960 --> 04:04.760
This was indeed welcome news as was $500,000 for the Wolf River which has run much Shelby

04:04.760 --> 04:07.880
County farmland for years and years.

04:07.880 --> 04:13.240
In addition, the river has been sometimes a smelly nuisance and its sluggish summer wanderings

04:13.240 --> 04:15.320
through downtown Memphis.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.840
All of us will be glad when a new channel for the Wolf has eliminated the flood threat and

04:19.840 --> 04:21.880
a verdict of its waters.

04:21.880 --> 04:26.400
Summing up public works projects for the state are I think they are bright for the coming

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
year.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.320
It will be my pleasure to report to you on the progress that has been made as they come

04:31.320 --> 04:36.520
before the House Appropriations Committee and before the Senate Appropriations Committee

04:36.520 --> 04:38.920
of which I have the privilege of being a member.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.320
Until next week at this time, thank you very much.
