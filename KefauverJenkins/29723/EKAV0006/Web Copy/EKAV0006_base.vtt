00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we have with us today Mr. Bob Kour, who is

00:10.480 --> 00:15.920
the director of our radio and TV studio here in the United States Senate.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.520
Bob, who's going to ask these questions?

00:18.520 --> 00:20.480
Certainly, it's good to have you with us.

00:20.480 --> 00:25.040
Well, Senator, it's been a long time since I have the privilege of being on a program

00:25.040 --> 00:27.000
with you almost since 1940, I think.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Well, Bob, I think we started back in the House of Representatives days making a flutter.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
That's right, Senator.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Talk about 1900 and 40.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
But Jerry Blossom we did.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Bob, Bob and Helen have been here directing this helping us ever since.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Jerry Blossom week, though, Senator, is still like it was back in 1940.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.160
Jerry Blossoms were a few days late this year, but I did notice that there were a lot of

00:49.160 --> 00:53.240
school buses with Tennessee license plates on them, and I'm wondering just why are you here

00:53.240 --> 00:56.000
in Washington when most of the senators are back home?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Well, Bob, it is too bad to chair Blossoms.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Well, a little late we had the festival last Friday in Saturday, Joanna Evans, you know,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Congressman Evans' daughter was Tennessee princess.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.400
We didn't have a single chair Blossom, then Sunday, the sunshine came out in Monday and

01:12.400 --> 01:15.000
Tuesday we had beautiful chair Blossoms.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
But about these Tennessee school children, many of the high schools in Tennessee have

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
a senior class trip come up to Washington, and I think this week we've had seven

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
or eight classes here.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Well, now, Senator, just what do you do for these school children?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Are they just up in to say hello or do you perform a service for them?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Well, I hope we perform a service.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
They usually come by the office and we give them passes to the Senate.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
I have a little guide book about what to see in Washington, and I show them my pictures

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
and little mnemon toes in my office.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
And then, usually we go down in front of the Capitol or on the back of the Capitol

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
now since the front is torn up and have a class picture made.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
It's one of the very pleasant parts about service up here seeing these school kids.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
They all say that they know a whole lot more about government, about White House,

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
about Congress after they've been here than they did before they came.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Now, let's leave the more pleasant things and get into the more prosaic matters.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
You're a chairman of a subcommittee, and he trusts, not only subcommittee,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
and you have currently been holding hearings.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Most of your hearings as I've been following them in the press have been directed to,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
I guess I should call it a cartel of large drug manufacturers who have been,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
according to material you bought out, overcharging the public

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
and making tremendous profits on certain drugs which are helpful to our sick and our ailing.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I wonder if you could give us a little background of that.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Well, I wouldn't call it a cartel, Bob.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Our antitrust and enough of the subcommittees charged with investigating

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
a lack of competition and great many industries, steel and bread in others,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
but I think our drug industry has attracted more attention.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
What we found is that the medical profession and pharmaceutical manufacturers

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
have played an important part in this have developed wonderful medicines,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
wondered drugs that keep people alive and give them better health in the last few years.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
But the sad fact is that in many cases, many of these drugs are,

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
beyond the reach of pocketbook wise of the average person who is sick.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
So what we are investigating is why are the prices so high?

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Why isn't there price competition between the large companies?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, what do you think?

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
Well, we found that there is not price competition among the large companies

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
on most of these ethical drugs.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
We found also that their profit of the drug manufacturers is about twice the average

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
of the average manufacturing company in the United States.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
And on net worth, for the last few years has been the highest, about 22% after taxes.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
We found also that they sell to the pharmacist for very much larger price

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
than the sell to the government when they did to the government.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
In one case, they sell to the pharmacist $100, $80 worth,

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
and the government would buy for the same thing for $30.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, now, Senator, the pharmacist is not the blame for these things.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
No, the pharmacist says he only adds his profit on what the manufacturer charges in

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
and he's entitled to make a reasonable profit, and he's not the one's blame.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And he's interested in getting the price down just like we are.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Well, Senator, I wish we had more time.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Thank you very much.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Thank you, sir.
