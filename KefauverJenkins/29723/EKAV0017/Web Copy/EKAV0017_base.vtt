00:30.000 --> 00:55.040
Hello and welcome to another edition of Washington Spotlight.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.360
The vital question under discussion today is, are congressional investigations being

00:59.360 --> 01:04.560
overdone? And our two guests are Senator Clyde Hoey of North Carolina and Senator

01:04.560 --> 01:09.600
Estes-Keef-Auber of Tennessee. And we'll talk to some representative Americans,

01:09.600 --> 01:15.280
but first, here's something else of interest.

01:15.280 --> 01:29.520
Earlier today, we sampled the opinions of several representative Americans on this vital

01:29.520 --> 01:35.200
question of the day down at the Capitol Step. Here we are to sample some opinions of representative

01:35.200 --> 01:37.680
Americans at the Capitol Step. May I ask your name?

01:37.680 --> 01:38.960
I'm Fred Morrassert.

01:38.960 --> 01:43.040
Mr. Morrass, you and our subject today is, our congressional investigation being overdone.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.320
What do you think about that?

01:44.320 --> 01:48.080
I don't think they are. You think all the exposures we've had of scandals and

01:48.080 --> 01:49.680
the arrestings might have been good, do you?

01:49.680 --> 01:51.520
I think most of them are in large years.

01:51.520 --> 01:57.680
Don't you think we may injure some innocent people if we drag so many investigations into life?

01:57.680 --> 02:01.920
Well, I think possible we have to do that to catch the guilty few.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.760
Some people have to be heard perhaps to get the guilty.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.480
I'm afraid so.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.520
Thank you, Mr. Morrassert.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.800
Thank you.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.160
And now may I ask your name?

02:08.160 --> 02:09.680
Mrs. Robert Hammondway.

02:10.400 --> 02:15.440
Mrs. Hammondway, how do you feel about this rash of congressional investigations we're having?

02:15.440 --> 02:16.880
Well, I think it's wrong.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.480
Why do you feel like this?

02:18.480 --> 02:22.320
Well, there's a lot of time spent and money spent that I feel we could spend

02:22.320 --> 02:24.240
another place, for instance, Korea.

02:24.240 --> 02:28.720
Do you think Congress is neglecting its real function for a lot of sidelines in other countries?

02:28.720 --> 02:32.960
Well, sidelines are important, but there are some things today that are more important.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.160
That are a lot more important, such as containing cons.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.040
Well, yes.

02:37.040 --> 02:37.840
Thank you very much.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.520
Now, your name is...

02:39.520 --> 02:41.520
Dorothy Cortland of New York City.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.520
Ms. Cortland, what do you think about this rash of congressional investigations?

02:45.520 --> 02:46.720
I think they're very good.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.720
I think that the people are an integral part of the government and they are entitled to know

02:50.720 --> 02:52.720
if the government is diseased or not.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.720
We ought to have even more than we've had.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.320
Certainly, because if the people don't know what's going on, they can't let Congress

02:58.320 --> 02:59.920
when they can do a clean job.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.920
And you're not afraid of discrediting all of the problems?

03:01.920 --> 03:02.720
No, I'm not.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.920
Thank you, Ms. Cortland.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.600
Thank you, Ms. Cortland.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.200
There we've had the opinions of some representative Americans.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.560
Now we're going to ask the first of our two special guests, Senator Keifob or some of his views

03:14.560 --> 03:17.840
on this important question. Senator Keifob or you have a minute.

03:17.840 --> 03:23.120
Mr. Chow's, I think the problems of government, both domestic and foreign have become so complex.

03:23.680 --> 03:28.560
That is necessary that we have full and adequate investigations, not only so members of Congress

03:28.560 --> 03:33.600
can know what laws to pass, but so the public can be informed and so we can also keep

03:33.600 --> 03:38.960
in touch with what the executive department of government is doing with the laws that we pass.

03:39.600 --> 03:45.600
I'm for full investigations, I think we can do better in avoiding duplication,

03:45.600 --> 03:47.760
but it's better to have too many than too little.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.600
Thank you, Senator Keifob.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.040
And now, Senator Hoey, you have a minute to sum up the same subject.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.920
I think it is necessary and essential to have investigations.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.800
I think, however, we should have care.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.760
They will not have so many investigations by Congress.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.080
The Congress might be considered to perform its functions by investigating instead of

04:08.080 --> 04:12.480
legislating. Of course, it's essential to have investigations in order to be able

04:12.480 --> 04:16.080
to properly pass legislation to deal with these questions.

04:16.080 --> 04:20.960
Nevertheless, I think it is difficult to decide just where you will draw the line.

04:20.960 --> 04:24.560
So many committees, developed matters, which they wish to investigate,

04:24.560 --> 04:28.800
and therefore we have none numbered investigations proceeding at the same time.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.120
And as a result, we have much duplication.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.960
Thank you, and you have a lot of confusion, too, don't you, Senator?

04:34.960 --> 04:36.240
No doubt about this.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.800
I'd like to put a question up to both, you gentlemen.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.360
I think that a lot of people feel that this thing has been overdone and that you have

04:43.360 --> 04:45.600
discredit in all the functions of government.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.680
What do you think about that, Senator Keifob?

04:48.240 --> 04:52.800
Mr. Charles, I think we need a revaluation of our whole investigative process.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.960
I agree fully with Senator Hoey that we ought to avoid duplication

04:57.760 --> 05:01.920
that we ought to get out on irrelevant matters and that the purpose

05:01.920 --> 05:06.800
investigation ought to be to enable us to get the facts with which to pass laws,

05:07.600 --> 05:11.040
informing the public is, of course, a very essential byproduct.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.960
Don't you have a resolution up on that, Senator?

05:12.960 --> 05:17.280
Yes, I do. I think one of the great effects of our congressional investigations

05:17.280 --> 05:22.000
is this resolution that you have here that seeks to cure S. Conrest 44.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.720
In other words, that all of our investigating committees ought to have a standard rule

05:26.720 --> 05:32.400
of procedure which will protect the rights of individuals without impairing to any

05:33.040 --> 05:36.800
substantial extent the investigative prerogative of comfort.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.280
You don't want to hurt any individual by dragging them through?

05:39.280 --> 05:44.400
Well, I noticed, remember Senator Hoey, you had a very important investigation on the RFC,

05:44.400 --> 05:47.040
wasn't it? Didn't you have General Vaughn up there?

05:47.040 --> 05:49.440
Yes, we've had a number of investigations.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.160
And I think...

05:50.160 --> 05:53.360
Don't you feel that General Vaughn, do you feel you gave him a fair deal up there or no?

05:53.440 --> 05:57.440
I think that most everybody would admit that those who appeared before are committed

05:57.440 --> 05:59.120
have had a square deal.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.080
You had a deep investigation.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.840
How deep did the investigation that you had that?

06:01.840 --> 06:06.560
Our investigations have been characterized by an evidence and an effort to undertake

06:06.560 --> 06:10.560
to abstain the truth and not to deal in just smears.

06:10.560 --> 06:14.960
And I think it's unfortunate to have any investigation where you adopt or permit

06:14.960 --> 06:18.800
while an unfounded rumours to be circulated to guest men in public position.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.000
Well, another thing about this investigation, I noticed Senator Keifover,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.320
you had a tremendous following out through the country as a result of your inquiry,

06:26.320 --> 06:28.560
and especially as a result of television.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.600
But is that being followed up now?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.640
Are we putting people in jail who should be put in jail?

06:34.640 --> 06:37.680
Well, the purpose of an investigation is not to put people in jail,

06:37.680 --> 06:42.720
but frankly, Marcus, I've been very highly pleased with the action that's been taken

06:42.720 --> 06:48.160
in states and counties and all over the country as a result of the facts that we disclosed.

06:48.960 --> 06:54.000
I think that Woodrow Wilson said that when the American people know the facts about some wrong

06:54.000 --> 06:55.920
doing, they're going to find some remedy.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.080
And I think much is to be done, but I am very well pleased.

07:00.080 --> 07:04.320
But don't you think you got a kind of cynicism here, Senator Hoey, you had Castello,

07:05.120 --> 07:06.880
he gets acquitted, didn't he the other day?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.000
Well, no, he didn't get acquitted.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.080
It was a hung jury, 11-13, and one more acquittal.

07:12.080 --> 07:15.360
So he's going to be tried over again, but of course, Jack Goosey.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.640
Greasy thumb, Goosey.

07:16.640 --> 07:22.640
Greasy thumb, he got acquitted, and that was a really very great disappointment to say the least.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.800
I'm going to say that as far as our communities concern, naturally, we're not prosecutors,

07:26.800 --> 07:31.360
but we have turned over to the Department of Justice, the evidence which has been developed

07:31.360 --> 07:33.200
before our committee in this result.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.400
In all most every instance, somebody's been convicted and sentenced to penitentiary.

07:36.400 --> 07:41.280
Well, I wonder if you feel, Senator Hoey, that what you did resulted in the cleaning up of the RFC?

07:41.280 --> 07:46.240
Well, I wouldn't say that broadly, but I think that the investigation has taken two months.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.520
Now, Senator Hoey has done a very fair and outstanding job.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.360
I think he isn't planned to be two mothers.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.880
That's characteristic of him.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.800
That's very generous, but on the other hand, I think that the number of investigation

07:56.800 --> 07:58.560
conducted have been helpful.

07:58.560 --> 08:04.480
For instance, we conducted this Mississippi office sale, which resulted in the indictment of 8-10

08:04.480 --> 08:07.520
people in Mississippi, two have already played guilty.

08:07.600 --> 08:13.440
Well, wherever there's this sort of miscarriage of justice in the sense of the administration of justice,

08:13.440 --> 08:14.400
become intended.

08:14.400 --> 08:18.240
Of course, I get the whether the corruption or bribery, I think it ought to be exposed,

08:18.240 --> 08:22.720
and I think the very exposing of it saves and proves as a deterrent.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.920
I get the impression there's some politics in these investigations, too.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.120
Wasn't it out of your investigation we got in the coat, Senator Hoey?

08:29.120 --> 08:33.840
Well, that developed in another investigation, but the reason, too, the RFC.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.680
I think we're going to hear about that in the fall, aren't we?

08:35.760 --> 08:37.280
That may be mentioned.

08:37.280 --> 08:43.920
But on the way, on the other hand, the Alchemydiers pursued the policy of not getting politics into it.

08:43.920 --> 08:48.800
We have a committee, of course, Sub-Commitic force of seven, four Democrats and three Republicans.

08:48.800 --> 08:53.760
But so far, in all reports filed, we have been able to file a unanimous report.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.400
I see.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.720
So the politics hasn't ended too well.

08:56.720 --> 09:02.000
I think I should say in that connection, Marcus, also, that our Senate crime investigation,

09:02.000 --> 09:06.320
we never had a minority report, and I don't think any politics came into it.

09:06.320 --> 09:14.960
I believe in what any congressional committee starts out with a determination to get the facts

09:14.960 --> 09:21.040
without regard to persecuting anybody or protecting anybody, just to get the plain facts to

09:21.040 --> 09:24.560
clean up a situation that you can do it without politics playing.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.120
Well, but here you are, a candidate for President, Senator.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.400
You can't deny that maybe the investigation has something to do with that.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.720
Might have been a contributing cause.

09:32.720 --> 09:38.000
Well, here he became a great figure, didn't he, on the table, on screens?

09:38.000 --> 09:44.160
Well, I don't want to be known as a crime investigator.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.200
I've been in Congress a long time, Marcus, as you know, working on that.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.160
That's a lot of other things.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.440
Foreign relations and animal opylene and a lot of other things, so.

09:51.440 --> 09:55.920
I want to agree that there was a Senate that he posted a statement about adopting a uniform rule

09:55.920 --> 09:57.040
about conducting investigatory.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.000
Do you think we've been too...

09:58.000 --> 09:58.640
Shut down, sir.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.760
I've got to be a shot guy.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.440
I think, yes, said one committee made up one rule and one different one.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.480
But I think in every committee, the individual appearing before

10:06.480 --> 10:08.080
and order have a fair chance.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.000
They ought not to be a dignified manager.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Their rights ought not to be impinged upon.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.800
And then another thing, I don't believe that in these committees,

10:14.800 --> 10:20.160
we all let rumors and groundless statements be made and hurled against people who are not involved.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.600
Gentlemen, I'd like to get...

10:21.600 --> 10:25.120
We're going to have some good fine revelations out of this session of Congress.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.800
Now, can you give us some...

10:26.880 --> 10:30.720
Well, in the last session of Congress, we had 130 investigations.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.920
I think a good many of them have been continued on.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.360
So I imagine this will be an investigating Congress also.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.040
I hear quite a lot about the...

10:39.040 --> 10:40.720
...anyone property custodian's office.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.480
Well, now, the Judiciary Committee of the Senate has to resolution...

10:46.320 --> 10:50.400
...a few days ago to enable investigation of the alien property custodian.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.760
Are you, Senator Geef-Oper going to continue your crime investigation?

10:53.760 --> 10:55.280
No, our crime investigation...

10:55.280 --> 10:57.440
...is not discontinued on 1 September.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.160
And our rights went to the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.720
which can take it up anytime it wants to.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.920
My feeling is we should get the facts for legislative purposes,

11:05.920 --> 11:09.200
and discontinue and try to get our legislation through.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.920
And in the case of the crime investigation,

11:11.920 --> 11:16.160
hope that the local people and state governments would carry on.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.400
And they have in our case, that's the...

11:18.400 --> 11:19.840
What about you, Senator? How are we?

11:19.840 --> 11:20.640
But I hear more about...

11:20.640 --> 11:21.760
The RFC or no.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.040
No, my committee is a pun, and I submit on investigations.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.320
We deal with all manner of things affecting expenditures in the government.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.280
I see. So that we have a variety of pieces.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.240
Gentlemen, I'm sorry I'm...

11:32.240 --> 11:33.120
I'm sorry I'm stuck in the rough.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.000
Thank you, Senator Hoey. Thank you, Senator Geef-Oper.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.840
And before we tell you about next week's guests at our program,

11:39.840 --> 11:41.840
here is a message of special interest.

11:41.840 --> 11:55.680
We hope you've enjoyed this edition of Washington Spotlight,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.840
and that you'll be with us again next week.

11:57.840 --> 12:02.480
When our subject will be, do we need universal military training?

12:02.480 --> 12:05.360
And our special guests will be Admiral Thomas Kincaid,

12:05.360 --> 12:07.840
of President Truman's Commission to Study,

12:07.840 --> 12:12.560
Universal Military Training, and James Kerry, Secretary of the CIO.

12:13.360 --> 12:18.560
Until then, this is Marcus Childs, signing off for a Washington Spotlight.
