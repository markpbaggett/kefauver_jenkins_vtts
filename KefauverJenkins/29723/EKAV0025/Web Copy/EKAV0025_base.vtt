00:00.000 --> 00:10.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, by the time you see this broadcast, and all

00:10.920 --> 00:15.700
probability Congress will have passed the labor reform bill.

00:15.700 --> 00:21.180
In recent weeks, I have received a tremendous volume of letters and telegrams on the subject

00:21.180 --> 00:24.200
of proposed labor legislation.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.280
In the House Passes, so-called Land and Griffith Substitute, to the Senate Kennedy Irving

00:29.280 --> 00:35.580
Bill, to the Kennedy Irving Bill, may have begun to reach a peak of about 1,000 letters

00:35.580 --> 00:36.900
and telegrams each day.

00:36.900 --> 00:43.220
I have tried to answer all of you during this time, the two versions of the labor bill

00:43.220 --> 00:46.460
have been under consideration.

00:46.460 --> 00:51.920
And I reply to you during the time they have been under in conference, has been in essence

00:51.920 --> 00:52.920
this.

00:52.920 --> 00:57.240
Let us give the countries a chance to come up with a bill which will correct racketeering

00:57.240 --> 01:02.920
and corruption, where it exists in the labor movement, but will not destroy the basic

01:02.920 --> 01:07.000
rights of millions of honest union men and women.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.840
I believe the countries have worked hard toward that end.

01:10.840 --> 01:15.240
The bill that came out of the conference was a great improvement over the original House

01:15.240 --> 01:20.600
Substitute version, and I think it's a bill that labor can live with even though many

01:20.600 --> 01:23.200
of them complain about it.

01:23.200 --> 01:28.960
I believe that both the Land and Griffith Bill and the Kennedy Irving Bill contain provisions

01:28.960 --> 01:35.840
that went a long way toward eliminating racketeering and corruption, wherever it existed

01:35.840 --> 01:41.080
in the labor movement, and where it was uncovered by the material and committed.

01:41.080 --> 01:47.560
And I think all American citizens were disgusted with the corruption and racketeering that was

01:47.560 --> 01:49.000
uncovered by that committee.

01:49.880 --> 01:55.040
But I think it should be pointed out that this was in a relatively few unions and not

01:55.040 --> 01:57.960
in the great majority of them.

01:57.960 --> 02:03.320
I doubt that there was ever any great disagreement between the two bills in this area of union

02:03.320 --> 02:08.200
official responsibility and the right of union members.

02:08.200 --> 02:14.480
Both bills had provisions for protecting funds of union members to prevent racketeering,

02:14.480 --> 02:21.480
prevent misuse of funds, for a secret balance, and for the right of union members to take

02:21.480 --> 02:24.880
place in elections and things of that kind.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.840
I do think there were some points in the House Bill which would have unfairly penalized

02:29.840 --> 02:31.640
honest labor unions.

02:31.640 --> 02:36.720
Through their earnest efforts in the countries most of these have been eliminated and

02:36.720 --> 02:38.480
glad to say.

02:38.480 --> 02:43.120
If any further corrections are found to be needed in this respect, Congress will be here

02:43.120 --> 02:47.600
early next year and can consider them and take action.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.800
This brand has been a most difficult task for all concerns.

02:51.800 --> 02:58.120
Give you an idea of the complexity and the intricacy of labor law that is involved in reaching

02:58.120 --> 03:01.440
a bill that will be most fair to all.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.760
Let me show you two key documents which the countries have been struggling with for

03:06.760 --> 03:08.320
12 grueling days.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.680
Here's the Landham Griffith Bill.

03:11.680 --> 03:18.680
This is a bill that will be available in the United States for 9 days and many, many

03:18.680 --> 03:19.680
nights.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.680
Very intricate.

03:20.680 --> 03:39.680
And out of these came the conference bill which I felt is fair, which may have some provisions

03:39.680 --> 03:42.000
that need to be corrected.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.840
Everybody is not going to be satisfied with every provision in it but Senator Kennedy and

03:47.840 --> 03:49.800
Senator Goldwater.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.720
All of the countries except one said this was the best that they could do.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.640
I think the country wanted a labor bill.

03:56.640 --> 04:02.200
I think the union members want protection against any unfair practices.

04:02.200 --> 04:07.400
I think our, the purity of our union effort is a great importance.

04:07.400 --> 04:12.800
And I'm glad that the bill has it long last been reported which will do a great deal

04:12.800 --> 04:16.720
to straighten out some situations in which I can support.

04:16.720 --> 04:23.800
I'm very sorry to report also that the public works bill was vetoed by the President.

04:23.800 --> 04:28.760
It was not overwritten in the effort in the House that missed by one vote.

04:28.760 --> 04:33.720
This included the West Tennessee tributaries and the Wolf River Project in Memphis.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.920
I hope we can get these in any other bill that's passed.

04:36.920 --> 04:43.920
That's all for now and thank you until next week.

04:43.920 --> 04:54.320
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.880
As I make this telecast, Congress is beginning to roll toward adjournment.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.880
By the time you see this, it is possible that this session may have ended.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.840
A number of important items of business hang in the balance however.

05:06.280 --> 05:10.280
The mutual security appropriation bill has just been reported out of committee.

05:10.280 --> 05:15.240
We are in the committee set until midnight the other night to hammer out the many items in this bill.

05:15.240 --> 05:21.400
It contains provisions for continuing our Cold War defences on many fronts, economic and military.

05:21.400 --> 05:27.200
As long as the free nations stand up to Soviet, Soviet Russia, free men will remain free.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.680
If we lower our guard, the result could be suicide.

05:30.720 --> 05:35.560
After two vetoes were the President, the Congress managed to vote out a housing bill,

05:35.560 --> 05:38.240
which is apparently acceptable to the President.

05:38.240 --> 05:44.200
It has been hard for this Congress to find anything that is acceptable all the way around to the White House.

05:44.200 --> 05:50.880
For example, we had to give up a most vital item in the housing bill in order to get it passed the creeping vetoism,

05:50.880 --> 05:53.320
which seems to have infected the White House.

05:53.320 --> 05:58.240
This item was for $15 million for construction of college classrooms.

05:58.240 --> 06:06.200
The administration expressed great concern over education after it was learned our country was behind the Russians in space missile development.

06:06.200 --> 06:15.160
It seems that this concern has diminished when we must give up appropriations of such funds for winning the long-range battle of education with Russia.

06:15.160 --> 06:20.440
Well, the public works bill was another which ran head-on into the President's fountain pen.

06:20.440 --> 06:28.840
Twice he wrote no across Congress's effort to move forward with flood control and other public works needed everywhere in the nation.

06:28.840 --> 06:39.600
The first time this bill came back to us, Congress cut 2.5 percent across the board out of it, reducing it almost $100,000 below the President's budget request.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.520
He vetoed this also.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.560
Well, I'm glad to report that the Congress has overwritten the second public works vetoed.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.600
The bill contains two much-needed projects in West Tennessee.

06:50.600 --> 07:00.800
One is the West Tennessee drainage projects project which would give relief from the continual flooding of farmlands and highways and the Forkadere and Obayan River areas.

07:00.800 --> 07:14.440
The other is the Wolf River Project at Memphis, which would permit a new channel for the Wolf to alleviate the flooded Shelby County bottomlands and to remove the somewhat famous unpleasant smells from north and downtown Memphis.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.400
As you can see, it has been an uphill battle against the President's veto.

07:18.400 --> 07:24.920
I am very hopeful that he will not veto the Highway Financing Act of which has passed the other night.

07:24.920 --> 07:34.360
Senator Gore and I and many others fought hard on the floor to continue the vital interstate highway program without slapping more gasoline taxes on the people.

07:34.360 --> 07:40.440
We were defeated, but at least the tax increase was held to one cent and limited to 21 months.

07:40.440 --> 07:47.080
This means that the states will be able to meet commitments to contractors and highway program will not bog down.

07:47.080 --> 07:59.400
I'm happy to report to Senator Gore and I were successful in having an amendment to this bill adopted which provides the necessary funds to build a highway bridge over TVAs pickwicked dam.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.120
The region around Savannah, Tennessee has needed this for some time.

08:03.120 --> 08:13.400
We are assured by the Bureau of Public Roads that our amendment now makes it possible for them to conclude negotiations with the State to Act on this vital link in our highway system.

08:13.400 --> 08:21.160
As the Congress struggles with its concluding workload, I'm sure that you have heard about Senator Wayne Mars' delaying tactics.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.680
The Senator from Oregon has been the subject to considerable criticism for this.

08:25.680 --> 08:31.680
I would like to say in his behalf that I feel sure that he is motivated by principles with your sound.

08:31.680 --> 08:41.280
Senator Mars maintains that the Senate often acts too hastily and without sufficient debate and deliberation when it's trying to close up business at the end of the session.

08:41.280 --> 08:50.960
He also maintains that the Congress of the United States should not turn tail and run out the back door just because premium cruise ship is scheduled to come in the front door.

08:50.960 --> 08:55.760
I think it should be said in Senator Mars's defense that he is since here in his position.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.920
I believe it's healthy to the Senate to have a dissenter like Senator Mars around.

09:00.920 --> 09:12.440
It keeps our eye on the ball and in the long run reminds us all that we are here to do a thorough job and to not run hastily through the nation's business or run away from responsibility.

09:12.440 --> 09:18.560
I hope I will have an opportunity to see you all again next week to report on the final actions of Congress.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.040
Until then, best wishes and goodbye.

09:31.920 --> 09:40.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the first session of the 86 Congress came to an end last week shortly after 6 a.m. on Tuesday.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.920
Just before Mr. Crusher arrived in town.

09:43.920 --> 09:51.920
One of the last pieces of business at the Senate and House acted upon was the question of whether or not to continue the Civil Rights Commission.

09:52.920 --> 10:02.920
I join my colleague, Senator Albert Gore and the Distinguished Majority Leader and 69 other senators and voting for the Continuance of this Commission.

10:02.920 --> 10:13.920
I predict that we will be more than happy that we have this group in being when the next session of the Congress sits next year, because sometime before the final vote was taken on its continual.

10:13.920 --> 10:20.920
Several senators who have been pushing hard for drastic punitive civil rights legislation gave notice that they were being called the Congress of the Congress.

10:20.920 --> 10:26.920
They were being ready to go to bat for such legislation on February 15th of next year.

10:26.920 --> 10:39.920
If we permit this extreme legislation, if we are to prevent this extreme legislation from passing, we will have in the Civil Rights Commission a powerful argument against taking hasty and punitive action.

10:39.920 --> 10:49.920
As long as the Commission is seeking the answer to these problems, which have a direct effect on the South, drastic steps will be much harder to ram through the Congress.

10:50.920 --> 10:55.920
When the Senate First Considered Establishing is Civil Rights Commission, I voted for it.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.920
Because I believe these are very serious problems that deserve careful and considered to study.

11:00.920 --> 11:06.920
The right of every qualified citizen to vote, for instance, is to be sacred and basic.

11:06.920 --> 11:13.920
And I think any intelligent investigation of voting privileges of any of our citizens is worthwhile.

11:13.920 --> 11:20.920
The first report of the Commission, which I have studied very closely, is not I must say a very satisfactory one.

11:20.920 --> 11:25.920
I am aware, of course, of the limitations of time under which the Commission had to work.

11:25.920 --> 11:32.920
But that is really no excuse for a careless staff work or for half-baked proposals, and the report shows vote.

11:32.920 --> 11:42.920
I was led to note however that the Commission recognizes that in 93 of the 95 counties of Tennessee, there is no question whatsoever of the right of any qualified citizen to vote.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.920
And we are proud of that.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.920
And two counties, there is somewhat of a problem.

11:48.920 --> 11:53.920
And that is something in which the thoughtful people of Tennessee and indeed of these counties are concerned.

11:53.920 --> 11:59.920
But in one of these counties, Haywood, the Commission shows the result of end-up staff work.

11:59.920 --> 12:09.920
For example, allegations that niggros own more property and pay more taxes in that county than whites, and that they must observe a curfew,

12:09.920 --> 12:14.920
and that they are not permitted near the courthouse unless they have business, or just not true.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.920
I know that they are not true.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.920
I have visited Haywood County not once, but many, many times.

12:20.920 --> 12:25.920
I think such careless handling of the facts by a federal commission is inexcusable.

12:25.920 --> 12:32.920
I presented all the more because concerning Haywood County, because that is the home county of my late beloved mother.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.920
And I have many relatives and close friends there.

12:36.920 --> 12:43.920
Many of the recommendations of the Commission are just as carefully conceived and wonderful from what I believe to be the intended school.

12:43.920 --> 12:48.920
The recommendation, for instance, of federal registrars, for voting is one.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.920
That's a problem that must be handled locally and not from the top.

12:52.920 --> 13:01.920
I believe the Commission needlessly went into some fields of housing, which aggravates an already difficult situation.

13:01.920 --> 13:07.920
But while I'm highly displeased with much of the Commission's work, although it does have some merit, frankly,

13:07.920 --> 13:11.920
I believe we must take a hard look at the alternatives to continuing the Commission.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.920
I did just that.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.920
And I believe the next session of Congress will bear out my conclusion.

13:17.920 --> 13:25.920
The extension of the Commission's life may be the best way we have to prevent legislation which would be harshly unfair to the South.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.920
Yet the South opposes even a study of the problems involved.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.920
And I'm afraid we may reap a whirlwind.

13:32.920 --> 13:37.920
As Commissioner Badall a distinguished member of the Commission and former Governor of Virginia said,

13:37.920 --> 13:44.920
we need to have considerably more discussion of the problems of human relations before legislative action is taken.

13:44.920 --> 13:48.920
Ladies and gentlemen, this will be the last telecast of this year.

13:48.920 --> 13:53.920
I want to thank the Station for carrying these as a public servant service.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.920
And I hope that we can continue them on next year.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.920
Now I want to thank you who have watched these for your suggestions and for your ideas.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.920
And it's been my great pleasure to make them.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.920
Until the next session of Congress goodbye.
