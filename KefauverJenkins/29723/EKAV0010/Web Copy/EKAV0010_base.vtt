00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This is Esther's key for August.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
It has been my privilege to serve the people of Tennessee for almost 22 years in the United States Congress.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Nearly 10 years in the House of Representatives in almost 12 in the Senate.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
With this announcement, I offer myself a re-election to the Senate subject to the Democratic primary of August sports.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
My platform will be my record of the past 22 years.

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
It is a record in which I have tried always to do the very best of which I was capable for the people of Tennessee and of the nation.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I am grateful to you people of Tennessee for the privilege of having been allowed to serve you.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
I am grateful also for the interest and support you have already indicated in behalf of my efforts for a re-nomination and re-election.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
It is particularly heartwarming to me because I wholly office of the United States Senator in such high esteem.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
It is one of the greatest in the power of the people to confer.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
And I know it is never conferred lightly.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
I have tried and will continue to try to make my efforts match the challenge of the times.

01:13.000 --> 01:22.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, there have been a number of very important matters which I have occurred in the Congress and in the Senate this week.

01:22.000 --> 01:34.000
As a matter of fact, I have just come from the floor of the Senate where an effort to override the President's veto of the distressed areas bill, failed by a vote of 45 to 39.

01:34.000 --> 01:48.000
As you know, it takes two-thirds of those voting in present to override a veto and so, by the majority of the senators voted to override this veto, there was not a two-thirds so the bill as either died or will have to be rewritten.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
I am worried about the distressed areas bill and this has been before the Congress for a number of years now.

01:55.000 --> 02:17.000
The bill which passed the both houses of Congress and the Senate to the President provided for the establishment of an agency with $250,000 to try to retrain people in areas where their industries have moved away and coal mining areas where the coal has been exhausted and the people are just living there.

02:17.000 --> 02:30.000
To get into other kinds of industry and other kinds of employment, a loans would be available for the purpose of assisting these communities and getting industries to move there to give the people employment.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
There would be some, there would be retraining as I said so that they could cut in with the industries that came in.

02:37.000 --> 02:47.000
They would also be under the housing area redevelopment program so that slums would be cleaned out and the towns and cities could be modernized.

02:47.000 --> 02:58.000
We must realize that today our national production is only about 2.5 percent increased each year, whereas the Soviet Union is about seven.

02:58.000 --> 03:08.000
This would help us catch up, but even aside from that these people in these communities ought to have gainful employment and they ought to be retrained.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
I thought it was a worthy bill, as a matter of fact I don't know of any state that would have benefited more from it than our state of Tennessee.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
Because we have many areas where there has been coal mining, where the coal has been exhausted and this bill would have kept these areas a great deal.

03:25.000 --> 03:38.000
Around Chattanooga, around Knoxville, in the Fallet, Jellico, in an area up around Bristol and up that way as well as a number of rural communities.

03:38.000 --> 03:48.000
What will happen now, either is that there will be no legislation or the amount will be reduced very substantially in line with the President's recommendation.

03:48.000 --> 03:59.000
Another bill that we've just had up and has to do with watershed districts, and I think this is one of the finest programs that we've had in our country.

03:59.000 --> 04:10.000
The idea is to prevent floods and to save the land and prevent soil erosion by having little bams and soil conservation back where the streams start.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
This program has been in existence for some time.

04:15.000 --> 04:26.000
We got an amendment to increase the amount for next year from 32 million, which was provided by the House to 37 million in the Senate, which has just passed.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
And also, there's a great need for planning of these projects and engineering and connection with them.

04:33.000 --> 04:47.000
Senator Russell, the chairman of the subcommittee agreed that he would not insist upon the reduction in the amount for planning and we go along with a full figure of 4,500,000, which was recommended by the House of Representatives.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, the Senate has passed the Education Bill, which is not pending in the House.

04:51.000 --> 05:00.000
The Veterans Benefit for, to extend Veterans Benefits and GI rights to Veterans since 1955.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
We've passed a Clean Elections Bill, which is still pending.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
We passed Mutual Security, which is now in the House.

05:09.000 --> 05:22.000
And the House has passed the Housing Bill, which we are now considering to continue on the Housing Program, also the Rivers and Harbors Bill, which we are particularly interested in.

05:22.000 --> 05:38.000
In the Rivers and Harbors Bill, there's a great deal about the Memphis Harbour Project, West Tennessee Drainage, money for study of Cumberland Priest, for Percy Priest Down, and for the Cardell Holddown on the Cumberland near Carthage.

05:38.000 --> 05:53.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this will be my last program for this session of Congress. I want to thank this station very much for allowing me to have this privilege and for you for allowing me to come into your homes and give you the news from Washington.

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
Thank you very much.

06:02.000 --> 06:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this is the first in our series of television programs from Washington, as what is going on in the Congress of the United States.

06:12.000 --> 06:22.000
This program will be done every week, and I will appreciate your comments about it, and I want to thank the station very much for carrying this as a public service.

06:22.000 --> 06:33.000
We will try to be nonpartisan and objective in our discussion of what's happening in Congress, and we will be bringing you guest on the program from time to time.

06:33.000 --> 06:49.000
I have on the program with me today a man that you'll be seeing a great deal of in the weeks to come, I shall call the well, and I very hence the administrative assistant who is here, and I'm glad to introduce you, Charlie, you've been introduced before.

06:50.000 --> 06:58.000
I think the very good way to start this program today will be, Charlie, for you to ask some questions about them.

06:58.000 --> 07:07.000
Senator, I'd like to ask some questions, I understand that Congress got in the session here on Wednesday, and how did it look up on the floor.

07:07.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, Charlie, I've never seen anything like it, whenever Congress comes back in session, there's a whole lot of heading on another on the back, glad to see old friends, no acrimony, everybody's friendly.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
And of course this year there was more handshaking, I think, than there has been before.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
That, because of a number of people that are announced and unannounced candidates for president.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, the Senate is pretty full of either announced or unannounced candidates for the president.

07:36.000 --> 07:47.000
We have Senator Humphries who started first in our Senate for Kennedy, and of course there are quite a number of unannounced candidates who all know about, and then of course vice president Nixon was there.

07:47.000 --> 07:57.000
And incidentally, for a time to time, I'm going to try to bring to you people who are listening on this station, the various candidates who express their views.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
I know that you'd like to hear from them. We'll bring Democrats and Republicans and try to keep it as nonpartisan as possible.

08:04.000 --> 08:17.000
But we got off to a very good start in the new Senate. We missed my little friend Senator Langer, who was the only member who had passed away since the last session, and his successor was sworn in.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
Senator, I'd like to ask you for comment on President Eisenhower's state of the Union message, which was just concluded.

08:24.000 --> 08:33.000
Well, first I want to say that President Eisenhower is looking very well indeed, and certainly heartening to see him in good spirits and, apparently, a very fit physically.

08:33.000 --> 08:43.000
I thought his discussion of our international affairs was very fine indeed. He outlined our aims for peace, but was being done to try to attain those aims.

08:44.000 --> 08:55.000
He pointed out that some progress had been made, but that the intentions of Mr. Kushchev and the Russians was yet to be tested, but it would be tested as time went on.

08:55.000 --> 09:07.000
He also pointed out that we could not be complacent that the best way to try to read some agreement for living together peacefully in the world was to be in a position of strength.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
He said that we had to keep up our defenses and the outland terms about that.

09:13.000 --> 09:27.000
I mean, I mean, a whole lot of notes about what he had to say among other things he had to say was that he was very necessary that the non-committed underdeveloped nations of the world that they have a better chance.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
And that the nations of Western Europe were on their feet now to share in that effort.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
I had introduced a resolution sometime back after our NATO-Lenton conference to that effective Europe challenge.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, what was your feeling about his domestic program? Well, I wasn't so happy about all parts of that.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
He first said that the agricultural program had been a failure as we all know, but he didn't seem to have any remedy for it.

09:53.000 --> 10:01.000
We all in favor of a school construction program, but I didn't know exactly how he was going to carry it out.

10:01.000 --> 10:13.000
And then I certainly agree that we all have fight inflation all out at the budgetary responsibility is necessary, but what we need also is to have more competition and prices.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
We need to stop this price of wage leapfrogging.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
And I wasn't very satisfied with what he had to say about stopping inflation.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
Well, Senator, I think we'll try to get the presidential candidates on his guests as the program's gone.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, I wish we had more time to discuss this.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Stay with the Union message, but generally I thought it was a very good presentation.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
That's all the time we have now friends. Thank you until next week at this time.

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
Ladies and gentlemen, our friends at Tennessee.

10:51.000 --> 11:07.000
During the past few weeks, I have received a great many letters from constituents and people in Tennessee asking that I explain something about the drug inquiry, which the Senate Committee of Ponmanopoli and Antitrust, of which I'm chairman is presently conducting.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
And I'm welcoming this opportunity of doing so.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
This Committee of which I'm chairman has been in existence for a number of years.

11:15.000 --> 11:26.000
We are charged with the responsibility of investigating monopoly lack of competition in order to try to see that we do not have cartels and monopolization.

11:26.000 --> 11:35.000
Also to try to see that the small businessman has a chance and that the consumer in the case of drugs, the patient gets a break too.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
And of course, if our investigation we have investigated steel, oil, automobile, electrical equipment and many many other things.

11:42.000 --> 11:50.000
And there was a demand that there be some investigation of the manufacturer's price, the big manufacturer's price of drugs.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
I think we received a great deal more mail on this than we did all the other investigations put together.

11:56.000 --> 12:08.000
Indeed, a number of other senators in congressmen were interested in investigation as a matter of fact, senators smathers while the resolution asking it he be authorized to make an investigation.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
But we have been collecting material for some time.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Now let me tell you just what we are trying to do.

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
In the first place I want to make it very, very clear that this as in other cases is only investigation of at the manufacturer's level.

12:26.000 --> 12:37.000
We are not undertaking to get into the retail investigation of retail pharmacists or drug stores or wholesalers or anybody else.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
As a matter of fact, the retail pharmacist is entitled to make a reasonable profit.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
His profit is less than it is in the good many other lands of industry.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
And by virtue of the fact that he has to carry such a large inventory of trade names, this doesn't increase his cost.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
We have the cooperation of a great many pharmacist I'm happy to say.

12:59.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm sorry to say however that some seem to be letting the pharmacists take the blame for what should be the what is the blame of the large pharmaceutical manufacturers.

13:12.000 --> 13:22.000
When they get complaints about prices at the retail level, they simply explain that they have to pay higher prices to the manufacturer for these products.

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
The second thing is that the physician is very much interested in the well fair economic welfare of his patient.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
For the first time in history the cost of drugs has exceeded the cost of medical care.

13:35.000 --> 13:44.000
Very often a physician will charge say $5 for a visit. The prescription may cost $9 or $9.5.

13:44.000 --> 13:54.000
And the physician knows of course that his patient can get better treatment. You can get more of these good wonder drugs if the prices are lowered.

13:54.000 --> 14:04.000
Now let's see just and the wholesaler also in the drug field is we're not investigating him and we're not blaming him.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
Because he only guess a 15% differential which is little enough for him to try to do business on.

14:11.000 --> 14:21.000
All of these are entitled a fair profit, a fair return and we're not fussing about that. We want the big manufacturers to get a fair profit too.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
But we don't want them to charge excessive prices to people.

14:24.000 --> 14:35.000
Here are the high profit industries in the United States. In 1957 was a typical year in 1958. It's about the same only drug to maybe be a little more.

14:35.000 --> 14:45.000
You will see that after taxes, after payment for all of research and everything else the drug industry averaged almost 22% on net worth.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
The average for all manufacturing was just about 11% and you see some of the others.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Well let me show you something about prices.

14:55.000 --> 15:06.000
In the case of a prednisone which is a card-son product used for the treatment of the 11 million arthritic people who must have these pills in the United States,

15:06.000 --> 15:14.000
the big companies charged the pharmacist is done at the same price as 17 and 9 cents per pill.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
But the little companies who meet food and drug standards and qualifications charge a whole lot less.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
They charge the government a whole lot less. We all in favor of research.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
But the research is only about 6.5% or 7% and can account for these high prices.

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
We hope we'll have more time to talk about this investigation later on. Thank you very much.

15:38.000 --> 15:57.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, it's a pleasure for me to report on a substantial number of new public works projects for East, Middle and West Tennessee.

15:57.000 --> 16:04.000
These projects were recommended by the President and his annual budget requests for the new fiscal year beginning next July.

16:04.000 --> 16:16.000
As a member of the Senate appropriations committee, we will have an opportunity to pass on the money, which will be required to bring these projects about and of course money has to be appropriated for them to become a reality.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Well last year a tragic situation developed for one of our Tennessee veterans.

16:21.000 --> 16:31.000
This disabled veteran was so sick he was unable to travel from Memphis to Nashville for his annual check-up as is required by the Veterans Administration.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
As a result his monthly pension allotment was threatened to be cut off.

16:35.000 --> 16:45.000
An investigation showed that all West Tennessee disabled veterans was traveled to Nashville because facilities are lacking at the Kennedy General Hospital at Memphis.

16:45.000 --> 16:59.000
I talked with Veterans Administration Summner Whittier last autumn and was assured by him that funds would be sought by the Veterans Administration for the construction of an outpatient clinic at Kennedy General.

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
And I'm happy to report that this promise has been kept. The President and his budget requests asked for $137,000.

17:07.000 --> 17:15.000
He set aside for construction of such a penny. I know many hundreds of disabled veterans who live in West Tennessee will welcome this news.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
The same is all citizens who honor those who fought in defense of their country.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
The tourist industry as we all know has become a multi-million dollar annual business in Tennessee.

17:27.000 --> 17:36.000
Each year the number of tourists increases thus providing employment for many of our people and spreading the fame of our state to all corners of the world.

17:36.000 --> 17:49.000
But like all businesses the customer must be satisfied. The President has asked Congress to appropriate more than $6 million for improvement in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and the Foot Hills Parkway.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
The largest item was $1,900,000 for completion of the long-needed 4 1 1 3rd Mile Getland Berg Barpass.

17:57.000 --> 18:06.000
Construction of the Melton Hill Dam on the clinch revereneer Clinton and Oak Ridge will begin this year as a result of another request.

18:06.000 --> 18:17.000
The project has been sought as a means of creating new generating capacity in our Great Tennessee Valley adding to flood control and navigation up to Clinton and Great Recreational Value.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
The President recommended an initial $4,000,000,000 for initial construction work.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Hundreds of new jobs will us be made available in that area.

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
And when completed more good TVA power for industrial expansion and other purposes will be provided.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
In the West Tennessee area more than $17 million has been requested for construction of Barclay Dam.

18:40.000 --> 18:53.000
Although located in Kentucky, compounded waters of Barclay Dam will back up into Tennessee and provide miles of recreational shoreline and of course flood control and navigation.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
Construction also will offer employment to many Tennessee and to live in that vicinity.

18:58.000 --> 19:07.000
The core of engineers has also asked for more than $2 million for operation in maintenance along the Cumberland River and its tributaries in middle Tennessee.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
Another approximately $1 million is sought for the operation of locks and maintenance of dams along the Tennessee River.

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
These requests should and I trust will receive approval by Congress.

19:20.000 --> 19:36.000
The President's request included $13,600,000 for construction start of Memphis's new federal building and $133,000 for site and planning of a federal building at Dazbury.

19:36.000 --> 19:49.000
This was indeed welcome news as was $500,000 as was the first $500,000 request for the Wolf River which has run much Shelby County Farmland for years and years.

19:49.000 --> 19:57.000
In addition the river has been sometimes a smelly nuisance in its sluggish summer, wandering through downtown Memphis.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
All of us will be glad when a new channel for the Wolf has eliminated the flood threat and the various waters.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
Summing up public works projects for the state are I think they are bright for the coming year.

20:08.000 --> 20:17.000
It will be my pleasure to report to you on the progress that has been made as they come before the House Appropriations Committee and before the Senate Appropriations Committee,

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
at which I have the privilege of being a member. Until next week at this time, thank you very much.

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, Senate within the past week took action on two bills of importance.

20:40.000 --> 20:51.000
The first was the so-called Clean Elections Bill. After a number of amendments were adopted on the floor, this bill was passed, vote of 59 to 22 and went to the House of Representatives.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
The bill strengthens the requirement for reporting of campaign expenditures in quite a number of ways.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
It places a $10,000 limit on the amount any individual can contribute to any campaign.

21:03.000 --> 21:12.000
It requires reporting of campaign contributions in connection with primaries, as well as general elections involving federal officers.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
It requires reports from states and local committees spending more than $2,500 for the benefit of federal candidates.

21:20.000 --> 21:32.000
It also provides the detailed financial statements be filed with federal district courts, where they will be available to the press of the various states, as well as with the clerks of the House and of the Senate.

21:32.000 --> 21:42.000
The bill makes campaigns spending limitations more realistic and puts teeth on a law which has been for all practical purposes, loosely drawn and largely ignored.

21:43.000 --> 21:51.000
An amendment that I introduced did not pass. I reintroduced this in the form of a bill and hope that further consideration may be given it.

21:51.000 --> 22:05.000
My amendment was designed to encourage small contributions to campaigns by a much larger number of citizens. It would permit a $10 tax credit or $100 tax deduction for campaign contributions.

22:05.000 --> 22:16.000
Turning to another subject in the field of juvenile delinquency, the Senate passed the bill, which would provide grants to the states for study demonstration projects on a nationwide scale.

22:16.000 --> 22:24.000
The bill would also provide funds over the next five years for the training of personnel to work in the juvenile delinquency field.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
Juvenile delinquency, as we all know, is one of the most serious major problems in the nation today.

22:30.000 --> 22:42.000
It has been steadily increasing for the past ten years. A few communities have escaped this impact, and it can no longer be thought of as being confined within the boundaries of neighborhoods, local communities, or even states.

22:42.000 --> 22:52.000
The effects of juvenile delinquency are violent, disrespect for human value, and property value, and a more dangerous weakening of our moral structure in our society.

22:52.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm happy that the Senate has taken this positive step toward attacking this problem, and hopeful that the House will concur in the action.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
I was happy to be a sponsor along with Senator Hennings of this legislation.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
As I make this broadcast to you in Tennessee, the Senate is debating a constitutional amendment, which I have proposed.

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
This amendment would empower the governors of several states to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives in case of a nuclear attack on Washington.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
Several attempts have been made in the past to get similar amendments passed, but they have failed.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm hopeful the Senate and the House will pass it this time with resounding majorities.

23:32.000 --> 23:42.000
I believe the amendment is more urgently needed today than ever before. It would plug a loophole in our Constitution, which could not have been foreseen by our founding fathers.

23:43.000 --> 23:52.000
If a nuclear attack should occur in heaven forbid that it should, it is almost certain that a large number of congressmen would be killed or fatally wounded.

23:52.000 --> 24:00.000
Under the law is it now stands only the House of Representatives could not be quickly reconstituted after a devastating attack.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
Vacancies in the judicial branch and in the Senate could be filled by appointment.

24:06.000 --> 24:13.000
A long line of succession is provided by the Constitution and federal statutes for the Office of Chief Executive.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
Vacancies in the House of Representatives can be filled only by election of the people.

24:18.000 --> 24:31.000
If a nuclear attack were to wipe out half of our congressmen, it would be vital that the government get back in action as quickly as possible and the House could not act if a point of no quorum remained on the first date.

24:31.000 --> 24:38.000
The Prime Amendment would enable the governors to appoint vacancies in the House of Representatives for a period of 60 days only.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
The primary argument against this amendment is that it is born out of fear and panic.

24:43.000 --> 24:53.000
To me this is the same as saying that a husband should never buy life insurance or fear of frightening his wife or that a parent should not have his child vaccinated for fear of frightening the child.

24:53.000 --> 25:04.000
I am working hard for the adoption of this amendment SJRAS 39 and hope we will be able to amend the Constitution to take out this serious loophole.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
That's all for this time. Thank you and goodbye until next week.

25:10.000 --> 25:39.000
Ladies and gentlemen, our friends of Tennessee, we were supposed to have Senator Manroney of Oklahoma on this program with us today to talk about the school bill that is being considered right now on the 4th Senate for both school construction and Senator Manroney is amendment to see that some grandinators made to the states to be the same.

25:39.000 --> 25:49.000
Senator Manroney has been asked to be distributed by the states without any strings attached to help with increasing or paying something on teacher salaries.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
Senator Manroney is speaking now and the amendment will come up for a vote very soon.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
I stepped away to come on down to report to you in his place.

25:59.000 --> 26:28.000
Senator Manroney, I would like to thank you for your support and support of the amendment that would give states the opportunity to use some of the federal money for schools,

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
for schools, for teachers, and what happened to that amendment last night?

26:33.000 --> 26:43.000
Well, we saw off where the administration had proposed some lending program which for school construction which was defeated.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
Then we had the Senator McNamara bill for just school construction, $500 million over a period of years.

26:51.000 --> 27:06.000
Senator Clark of Pennsylvania offered an amendment to $1,100,000,000 to be divided by the states and their usual proportion between school construction and teacher salary.

27:06.000 --> 27:17.000
That was defeated, $44,000 to $45,000 and the vice president voted and broke the tie so it was defeated $45,000 to $44,000.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
I was lost by that very narrow margin late last night.

27:22.000 --> 27:38.000
I spoke for the amendment as is my colleague Senator Gore because we feel that education is the greatest importance right now, not only because of our contest with the Soviet Union but for our general welfare.

27:38.000 --> 27:47.000
We have all the schools in the world but we must start paying our teachers more than what might just pay a fireman.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
We are not going to have good education. It is absolutely imperative.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
Senator, do you have any expressions of support from the state of Tennessee for this bill?

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
Yes, I certainly have. I have had a good letter from Governor Ellington and support of it.

28:02.000 --> 28:11.000
I have had a lot of much factual information from Commissioner Joe Morgan. They tell us the education association is actively far.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
Teachers, parents, members of the parent teachers association.

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
What do you think Senator of the charge that the opponents of the bill have made that this bill would lead to federal control of the schools?

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
Well, I don't think that is well founded. We have had the moral plan that found the health of universities.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
We have had the PWA program to pursue construction.

28:34.000 --> 28:48.000
It is set in the amendment and in the bill itself that there should be no federal control that the money is a grant and aid to the states for them to use, pursue construction and for teachers.

28:48.000 --> 28:56.000
The federal government has no right to have any administrative control, control of curriculum or anything else that can't.

28:56.000 --> 29:05.000
In the few moments we have left, Senator, would you tell us about the SJ Reds 39 about the congressional seats that was passed this last year?

29:05.000 --> 29:15.000
Well, before we end, I hope by the time this telecast has seen that we will have passed this national aid to education bill in the United States Senate and becomes law.

29:15.000 --> 29:32.000
Well, we passed a very important constitutional amendment last week. I think I discussed the part of the amendment that I filed originally to enable governors to temporarily fill vacancies in the House of Representatives and they have ended up national disasters, so our Congress could go on.

29:32.000 --> 29:52.000
That was the hall of the amendment to take away the requirement of a pool tax for voting for federal officials in the four or five states that still have it and also the Keating Amendment to give some right of the people of the district to vote for national electors for President and Vice President.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
I believe, Chalice, that's all the time we have. Thank you and good-bound. Until next week.

30:03.000 --> 30:16.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, they are on the program we are delighted to have one of the finest members of the United States Senate, a person that I think is a real statesman.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
Senator Mike Manroney of the State of Oklahoma, Mike, we might have led the heavyweathers today.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Thank you, I have some probably here.

30:23.000 --> 30:38.000
Senator Manroney came to the House of Representatives January 1939, same time our colleague who is his very dear friend, also Albert Gore came and I came a few months later.

30:38.000 --> 30:52.000
Then we came over to the Senate later on. We remember that he was the sponsor of the Fowlet Manroney Bill for the reorganization of Congress and he is one of the most thoughtful members of the United States Senate.

30:52.000 --> 31:06.000
Mike, you have been very active and I have said it to Gore and I joined with you to the extent that we could and securing passage of an education bill in the United States Senate a few days ago.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Will you tell us something about it?

31:07.000 --> 31:16.000
This, I think, was one of the greatest forward steps the Senate has taken. The bill, as it came to us, provided roughly $500 million limited for school construction.

31:16.000 --> 31:31.000
We, the amendment which you and Albert and some 31 other Democratic Seniors sponsored added teacher salaries as well as construction and provided for a $20 per capita payment to the States.

31:31.000 --> 31:45.000
Thus in this amendment, the key fall for Gore and Manroney amendment and others, we raised to a degree about $400 million the annual cost of the bill but we made it possible for the States to direct whether they wanted this money for the State.

31:45.000 --> 31:52.000
Whether they wanted this money for construction or for teacher salaries or how they wish to divide it so it is completely State-operated bill.

31:52.000 --> 32:07.000
And one I think that properly evaluates the great and pressing need for teacher salaries to obtain the very best possible teaching and at the same time keep the good teachers still in the school as we are turn over as tremendous in the teaching profession.

32:07.000 --> 32:15.000
Well, I, of course, led to do everything I could for his passage but you were the principal sponsor and some of us just helped.

32:15.000 --> 32:26.000
Now, the Tennessee Education Association has passed a week at a meeting in which they were asking that there would be some little raised by the State and the school teacher salary.

32:26.000 --> 32:33.000
These funds could be used for the purpose of, as the State saw it, for the purpose of giving some raised in their discretion.

32:33.000 --> 32:47.000
Any way the State wishes to divide it between construction and teacher salaries and our investigation shows that the municipalities and local agencies of government are incapable of raising the funds necessary to pay an adequate salary to keep the teachers.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
It doesn't make a lot of sense just to have buildings unless you can have adequate and well qualified teachers, certainly.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
How about the argument that this might lead to federal control of our school?

32:58.000 --> 33:12.000
Well, the bill is carefully guarded against that, providing that can't be any federal control. The action of the Senate showed we didn't want any federal control, didn't put it on a formula basis to what percent buildings and what percent teachers we trust the State and the local subdivision divided properly.

33:12.000 --> 33:19.000
This does really give them some leeway and I don't think there's any danger of federal control in it.

33:19.000 --> 33:27.000
Well, this is one of the most far-right steps that will have been taken during this session of Congress. I certainly hope the House of Representatives goes along.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
I certainly do too.

33:28.000 --> 33:38.000
I want to ask you briefly one other thing. Senator Monroni has chairman of the Committee that investigates and has to do with legislation affecting aviation.

33:38.000 --> 33:47.000
Now, tell us a little bit about what the trouble is with so many planes falling and so many difficulties and what you have recommended.

33:47.000 --> 34:06.000
Well, actually we're not in too bad a shape. We only ran 168th of a percent for 100 million miles past your miles blown. This is way below what we figured would be a good safety margin, but we need better ground aids, approach lighting, better runway lighting.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
We need 45 percent of the accidents occur in flight in this area. We need...

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You mean near the runway?

34:12.000 --> 34:19.000
The runway to guide the pilot in for the final touchdown and only three airports have modern two-way lighting on their principal runway.

34:19.000 --> 34:30.000
We need better air reporting. 20 percent of our air stations reporting weather are only on part-time and we need very many other things as well.

34:30.000 --> 34:38.000
Well, you've done a great job in trying to get adequate funds for airport construction and safety control and you've gotten something but not enough.

34:38.000 --> 34:49.000
Well, I wish we could go on. We certainly appreciate you coming on, Mike Monroni and being with us today and a lot of people in Tennessee know you until this time next week. That's all for now.
