00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
In the breeding process we, phrases to pick up the

00:19.000 --> 00:19.000


00:19.000 --> 00:20.120
Acts 5.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
The

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Atlantic community as well as our latest

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
distinguished husband.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Lady Ali, it's good to have you with us.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.520
What did you think about the NATO conference that we have just completed?

01:00.520 --> 01:03.000
I thought it was a really great success this time.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.360
It seemed to me to go very smoothly and harmoniously and we passed on to fresh subjects that interest

01:09.360 --> 01:14.400
to me very much like the economic cooperation as well as the military cooperation and also

01:14.400 --> 01:18.000
the cooperation on the sort of intellectual and study side.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
But you are particularly interested in how to do it.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes, I am.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.440
I think it all of us agreed that we had to, all of our nations had to contribute and do

01:26.440 --> 01:33.400
something to help with the developing nations of Africa, Asia and South America.

01:33.400 --> 01:40.500
And for that purpose, we recommended the approval of OECD which would include the NATO nations

01:40.500 --> 01:43.800
plus some others in the Atlantic community.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.360
I think that's excellent because that is really one of the burning subjects facing the

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
whole world.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.400
Yes, and we have got to have, we can't be working across purposes.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.400
I think that was understood.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.600
They were spying on understanding and cooperation about this economic problem.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.600
It could be more.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.000
I think there will be more participation by all of our NATO nations.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Don't you think so?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I think that's a big deal.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.900
Yes, and certainly important.

02:06.900 --> 02:12.560
I think the conference was the best one that we have ever had and I think this is my

02:12.560 --> 02:15.200
fourth or fifth one to attend.

02:15.200 --> 02:20.200
And from our American delegation, of course, we had Vice President-elect Senator Johnson,

02:20.200 --> 02:24.360
Senator Fulbright, the chairman of our Foreign Relations Committee, and you had a very

02:24.360 --> 02:27.120
distinguished delegation from the United Kingdom.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.720
Yes, we had members of the Labour Party and members of the Liberal Party, members of the

02:30.720 --> 02:32.720
House of Lords, all together.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.720
It was good, I think.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.760
Lady, I think one thing I've had very much interest in today, and then it was a resolution

02:37.760 --> 02:44.280
that I sponsored here in the NATO parliamentarians too.

02:44.280 --> 02:52.040
As you have been interested in this too, we have authorized, in our Congress, the appointing

02:52.040 --> 02:59.040
of delegates to have a citizens convention on NATO problems during the next year.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.600
And here at the Parliamentarians' Association, we've passed a resolution recommending that

03:03.600 --> 03:05.200
other nations appoint delegates.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.440
And I know of your great interest in this, appreciate your support.

03:09.440 --> 03:14.080
Yes, well, I so agree with you that what we want to do is we want to make the ordinary

03:14.080 --> 03:18.760
people of our two countries, indeed all other countries in the world, understand something

03:18.760 --> 03:20.920
about what the NATO learns, really means.

03:20.920 --> 03:25.400
And you can't do that by only talking about military things because military things passed

03:25.400 --> 03:30.160
by people who can't, if you can get hold of them, to discuss how they are connected with

03:30.160 --> 03:32.720
cooperation, well, we might get something.

03:32.720 --> 03:38.160
And then there are so many problems coming up in this conference like NATO control of

03:38.160 --> 03:41.600
atomic weapons and their use.

03:41.600 --> 03:49.040
And I think, in our economic aid to the developing nations, many, many of our trade policies as

03:49.040 --> 03:51.400
they relate to the Soviet Union.

03:51.400 --> 03:56.280
I think all of these things should require the lengthy consideration and the full consideration

03:56.280 --> 04:01.840
of a citizens' convention, where they would have time to call in experts and time to

04:01.840 --> 04:06.680
meet and to thank and to meet again and to make recommendations to their government.

04:06.680 --> 04:13.680
I think this might give us some ideas that would enable us to be on the way to many solutions.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.680
I agree with you.

04:14.680 --> 04:18.320
After all, we've got to work more with this, more doors, we've got to look out on the

04:18.320 --> 04:20.120
world, onto a new picture.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.320
And I think that there is one of the things that it might well do.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.640
I was very interested in it indeed.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.640
Well, Lady Elliott, you have been very much interested in the Atlantic Institute.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.520
Will you, we have a moment where you say something?

04:31.520 --> 04:37.360
Yes, will the Atlantic Institute, is really the idea of mobilizing the intellectual and

04:37.360 --> 04:43.880
university and skilled technicians in the field of landing in the same way as we've mobilized

04:43.880 --> 04:50.080
them in the field of military affairs so that we can draw upon their ideas and their suggestions

04:50.080 --> 04:55.520
for a policy for the NATO nations over and above the policy of military cooperation.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.520
And I don't, we may get something out.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.160
Well, Lady Elliott, thank you very much for being on this program.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.920
And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is Esther's key fault, we're speaking from NATO headquarters

05:04.920 --> 05:11.280
in Paris and reporting with Lady Elliott on the happenings of our sixth annual NATO

05:11.280 --> 05:12.280
parliamentarians conference.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.280
Thank you.
