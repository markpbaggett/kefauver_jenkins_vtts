00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
Ladies and gentlemen, Prince of Tennessee, as I make this telecast, Congress is beginning

00:16.320 --> 00:18.240
to roll toward adjournment.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.840
By the time you see this, it is possible that this session may have ended.

00:21.840 --> 00:26.240
A number of important items of business hang in the balance, however.

00:26.240 --> 00:30.320
The mutual security appropriation bill has just been reported out of committee.

00:30.320 --> 00:33.960
We on the committee set until midnight the other night to hammer out the many items in

00:33.960 --> 00:35.280
this bill.

00:35.280 --> 00:39.880
It contains provisions for continuing our Cold War defenses on many fronts, economic

00:39.880 --> 00:41.440
and military.

00:41.440 --> 00:47.280
As long as the free nations stand up to Soviet Russia, free men will remain free.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.880
If we lower our guard, the result could be suicide.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.680
After T2V toes were the President, the Congress managed to vote out a housing bill, which

00:55.680 --> 00:58.280
is apparently acceptable to the President.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.640
It has been hard for this Congress to find anything that is acceptable all the way around

01:02.640 --> 01:04.240
to the White House.

01:04.240 --> 01:08.640
For example, we had to give up a most vital item in the housing bill in order to get it

01:08.640 --> 01:13.440
past the creeping vetoism, which seems to have infected the White House.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.280
This item was for $50 million for construction of college classrooms.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.480
The administration expressed great concern over education after it was learned our country

01:22.480 --> 01:26.240
was behind the Russians in space missile development.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.560
It seems that this concern has diminished when we must give up appropriations of such

01:30.560 --> 01:34.280
funds for winning the long-range battle of education with Russia.

01:34.280 --> 01:39.720
Well, the public works bill was another which ran head-on into the President's fountain

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
pen.

01:40.720 --> 01:45.800
Twice he wrote no across Congress's effort to move forward with flood control and other

01:45.800 --> 01:48.880
public works needed everywhere in the nation.

01:48.880 --> 01:53.800
The first time this bill came back to us, Congress cut 2.5 percent across the board out

01:53.800 --> 01:59.600
of it, reducing it almost $100,000 below the President's budget request.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.880
He vetoed this also.

02:00.880 --> 02:06.560
Well, I'm glad to report that the Congress has overwritten the second public works veto.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.680
The bill contains two much-needed projects in West Tennessee.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.920
One is the West Tennessee drainage projects, which would give relief from the continual

02:14.920 --> 02:20.800
flooding of farmlands and highways in the Forkadir and Obayan River areas.

02:20.800 --> 02:25.440
The other is a Wolf River project at Memphis, which would permit a new channel for the wolf

02:25.440 --> 02:31.160
to alleviate the flooded Shelby County bottomlands and to remove the somewhat famous unpleasant

02:31.160 --> 02:34.440
smells from north and downtown Memphis.

02:34.440 --> 02:38.120
As you can see, it has been an uphill battle against the President's veto.

02:38.120 --> 02:43.760
I am very hopeful that he will not veto the Highway Financing Act of which shows past

02:43.760 --> 02:45.120
the other night.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.680
Senator Gore and I and many others fought hard on the floor to continue the vital interstate

02:49.680 --> 02:54.400
highway program without slapping more gasoline taxes on the people.

02:54.400 --> 03:00.560
We were defeated, but at least the tax increase was held to one cent and limited to 21 months.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.960
This means that the states will be able to meet commitments to contractors and the highway

03:04.960 --> 03:07.080
program will not bog down.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.840
I'm happy to report that Senator Gore and I were successful in having an amendment to

03:10.840 --> 03:17.840
this bill adopted, which provides the necessary funds to build a highway bridge over TVAs

03:17.840 --> 03:19.400
pickwicked dam.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.160
The region around Savannah, Tennessee has needed this for some time.

03:23.160 --> 03:27.080
We are assured by the Bureau of Public Roads that our amendment now makes it possible for

03:27.080 --> 03:33.560
them to conclude negotiations with the State to act on this vital link in our highway system.

03:33.560 --> 03:38.080
As the Congress struggles with its concluding workload, I'm sure that you have heard about

03:38.080 --> 03:41.200
Senator Wayne Marce's delaying tactics.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.640
The Senator from Oregon has been the subject to considerable criticism for this.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.900
I would like to say in his behalf that I feel sure that he is motivated by principles

03:49.900 --> 03:51.920
with your sound.

03:51.920 --> 03:56.240
Senator Marce maintains that the Senate often acts too hastily and without sufficient debate

03:56.240 --> 04:01.280
and deliberation when it's trying to close up business at the end of a session.

04:01.280 --> 04:05.640
He also maintains that the Congress of the United States should not turn tail and run

04:05.720 --> 04:10.920
out the back door just because premier Kruchev is scheduled to come in the front door.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.720
I think it should be said in Senator Marce's defense that he is sincere in his position.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.960
I believe it's healthy to the Senate to have a dissentor like Senator Marce around.

04:20.960 --> 04:25.600
It keeps our eye on the ball and in the long run reminds us all that we are here to do

04:25.600 --> 04:32.440
a thorough job and to not run hastily through the nation's business or run away from responsibility.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.860
I hope I will have an opportunity to see you all again next week to report on the final

04:36.860 --> 04:38.620
actions of Congress.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.920
Until then, best wishes and goodbye.
